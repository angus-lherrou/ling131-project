heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that late it almost habitable that top Democrats ... ... what the target and\nThey're saying there is no connection between what Trump has said about Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Eric Holder and John Brennan and CNN and the thinking of the purse they sent those pipe bombs is foolhardy this is someone who has a weaponized Trump's\nTwitter feed and made it into a hit list\nNotice are we switch there and that little montage replayed it starts off with very prominent famous anti Trump Democrats saying all manner of you know nasty Vineland\nGag richer story is that a word I think it's a word degrading I think I think I might have just made up degrow story is that I did I just make up a word or derogatory\nDegree tore oh yeah yeah I did\nI just made up a word um yeah I just made up word on live\nRadio that's interesting you know we'll go with it derogatory was what I was looking [laughter] but but that great story sounds doesn't that although you know it kinda sounded like a word I kind of made up my word there for a second uh folks been a long way\n[laughter] you go but I you know that's when you know you're a real baller like Bush when when Bush said Mr underestimated I knew exactly what he meant you know and that's no word when he called himself the decider\nThat wasn't technically a word either but it might as well up in a word and now it is a word I think it's great you know who's the decider was the old who's the person who makes the decisions I don't know the decider\nUh anyway so I made up or the let's get back to the substance or so they they are all saying these things about Trump very nasty things very um two rockets or a things and then they all immediately jumped you it's Trump's fault it's Trump's fault but there's clearly disturbed very\nYes dangerous and and and evil but added pathetic human being a decided to send these these homemade there were pipe bombs and they were they were alive bombs I mean they could have gone off at this guy I knew what he was doing thank God they did not um but\nThere's really no principle that the left is using your determine you know what is acceptable what is acceptable political speech and what does incitement it's just what is your side do that's bad what is my side do that's okay and that's really the primary separation\nThere's really not a lot to separate things beyond that there's not much that you can point you were you'd say you know oh I see that there is some establishment of an actual baseline of of how we can adjudicate these things no no no it's just my side good your side bad\nAnd we know that this was going to happen\nOr it's just it's just very it's frustrating to see this um because it is so it is so obvious it is so clear oh\nGovernor Cuomo also wants to work in all the bombs let me first start that a bomb is a combustible device with explosive material that can be dangerous place Thirteen\n[noise]\n\nYour\nI think the president of the United states should take responsibility for the kind of violence that we're saying\nFor the first time in different ways I think the president of the United states has been dog whistles to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by those people over there and I think that they are\nBut they believe the president wants them to do it as oh way really does do a lot of promote violence now they're trying to turn it on a course or would they would like to intimidate us and of\nCourse we must be a wisely must be foolish and how can a polish ways\nBut we never saw the show ended up by the justice and equality in this country\nMaxine Waters very foolish and you know we we just gave you there on the one hand she's calling for essentially rabble rousing she wants people to get up and faces she wants to you know yell and scream and be nasty and mean and you know don't don't give them a moment's peace and then she's you know saying that\nTrump is the one who is is inciting violence Trump is the one who is causing a causing problems and this is why I I knew this was going to be the case all week uh assuming that we got to where we are now are we know that this guy is a wacko and\nIs going to be the right is going to be saddled with this with this complete you know look\nHe's a dangerous he's a dangerous maniac so he's got to spend the rest of his life in prison and he needs to do there need to be serious consequences for this well you know that this guy is also I mean each it there's something sad about someone who\nIs show show deranged empathetic and an evil\nAnd just the whole thing I mean he's a really pathetic human being um but ... now we're supposed to act like this guy has supporters are this guy is representative of a broader sense but on the right meanwhile\nDo we have a country of three hundred and twenty million people\nAnd now I can think of er there's one there's one person that we can associate with being a Trump supporter or who since Trump has been president\nPeople would say oh well\nYou know he's a he's a lethal threat because of his uh what he views as his politics um but now that they're going to make this you're going to hear about this for ever is never going to go where they're going to be talking about this one I mean they still talk about oh an abortion clinic bombers from like the Nineteen nineties and things like Nineteen Ninety three\nYou'll still hear about bombing abortion clinics hasn't happened and you know a very long time but that's anytime you talk about terrorism and and then you also get into this whole discussion and\nI wanted to discuss this with the young Turks guy who was on my show and rising morning with junk we're never going to hear again you watch next week there'll be this oh right wing terrorism is really scary terrorism right wing terrorism kills more people that tends to be the\nThe headline that they lead with\nAnd I always have to point out well the big issue there is one do you exclude nine eleven from it\nAh that's first and foremost but then also there's a whole bunch of other things like how do you really count this what is the determining factor whether something is counted as terrorism because with some of the federal statistics that they look out for this they'll say well\nYou know neo Nazi got into a bar fight and stab someone to death Nicole ... well if the guy was a minority those stairs now is that a hate crime is murder yes\nIs it terrorism though in the way we think of terrorism the the definition can be a little bit a little bit less ... less clear right it's a hate crime it's murder but is it terrorism uh and then you you look at the way that they constantly exclude from a from the discussion and from\nThe statistics forwarded attacked him in the moment that you start looking at worded attacks than you realize that radical Islam is far and away the biggest threat that we\nKnow you look at the times square bomber you look at the underwear bomber frugal most of them will tell them I mean these are attacks would have killed hundreds of people most of the right wing terrorism at the site with a with a couple of exceptions over the last Fifteen Years most of the right wing terrorists may site is single acts of violence against individuals by\nA neo Nazis or or or white nationalist again heinous evil\nOr crimes that should be punished the full extent of the law but it's not a strategic level national threat terrorism the way that radical Islamic terrorism is but I'm just telling you you're going to now that we've got this guy who's been captured today\nThis is a says our fellow says are uh say rock whatsoever keep forgetting is how the same last name and I never remember his first name but not not studied everyone's saying uh everyone's saying that\nYou know he's obviously so pro Trump ... such a bad guy said or say ... say opposites Iraq say are\nOr what is a we know what is\nIt is not I mean these American but what what's his his parents nationality or his parents parents nationalities wondering if there's any me his first name says are the kind of unusual anyway [noise] ah\nYeah they're ... they're going to run with this though and this is where we have to deal with now this was not going away anytime soon it's ah unfortunately going to be used against us and I don't know if it's going to sway the midterms I really hope that it doesn't I Hope that people can see that this is just one deranged maniac but\n... you're gonna see flood zone coverage of this issue for the next\nSolid\nWeek and change because they want this to be first and foremost on the minds of as many voters as possible and and\nThey're going to be they're going to be really pushing this and they really want people to think that this is\nThis is what will need to be on the lookout for the real concern is right wing terrorism when\nThere's going to be crazy people of all kinds from all places but they're yeah [noise]\nHere's a tweet from President Trump quote Twitter has removed many people from my count and more

very much about the redistribution of wealth\nAnd I think it's show noteworthy that President Obama who himself\nHe's incredibly wealthy incredibly powerful that's where he knows that's a sweet spot

their own money\nTo the government there being greedy\n... this is a a at a central talking point on the left you'll you'll hear this all the time you know tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires okay well they're still paying a vastly disproportionate share of taxes overall I mean are the top one percent pays I think thirty percent of all federal income taxes\nSo there we already have a very\nProgressive income tax system but that doesn't really factor in does it for for Obama it's all just about ... you are oh you being the people that he's talking to you wherever it is wherever it

are the Democrats have to say how do they explain all these Democrat billionaires who are out there you know what do they have to say about that and the answer is\nYou know they never really addressed is why is it that if you're an incredibly wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur hedge fund manager a Hollywood celebrities are going to listen to these are people that have amassed\nIncredible fortunes all Democrats why are they all Democrats you know what what I find to be the case is that people people that have had to work incredibly hard and overcome tremendous struggle to make their money\nUh

Seventeen [laughter]\nWe're\nFor fake bank [noise]\nFinancial crisis in our life [noise] and Democrats [noise]\nWell why did it start with Obama how how about\nWe've had even we had an even bigger\nFinancial pull back with the great depression and we recovered from that and ... and enter period of huge economic growth and a boom I mean Obama really at what point does he does does it become laughable that he thinks he takes credit for the economy and we're we're almost two years in the Trump presidency we're still hearing about\nHow about ... remind her by the way Obama never achieved or three percent growth GDP Growth for an entire year never\nOnly president in history\nFor whom that's the case\nSo when do we get to say that this is just ridiculous\nThat what he's saying is is transparently false and and I would also note you know the uh the government\nWas the problem with what happened in the great recession and liberals don't ever talk about this you know when he says agree banks and all this stuff that's what happened no it would really happen was a liberal said that banks to lend to people who can't pay it back\nBut if you can't pay it back and you happen to be non privileged and particularly the fall into certain minority categories then banks has to lend you even though you're bad you're a bad bet for a loan\nAnd you do that enough and the federal government backstop those loans and says well we'll we'll pay if these people to fall we we've got you got you covered Wall Street and Wall Street does what it does\nThat's what really happened I mean you know one question Obama should be forced to ask or be forced to answer rather by someone in the media would be what exactly did you do that was so great for the economy\nWhat exactly does does he think\nGot and it was just got to grow the economy go go go gotta going how what what exactly did he do\nAnd I think the truth is it's very clear he he has absolutely no answer that I mean the stimulus was was atrocious as soon as was a huge waste of money and that was money that was put on the tab for future generations to pay so what ...\nWhat did Obama bring to the table when it came to

uh in in political media which is\nYou know you exaggerate to get attention no no I I mean that there are a lot of people on the left who have had a real clinically um possible to evaluate nervous breakdown that they have lost it I mean they have lost it in a profound way a and\nThis is this is telling us that that's exactly what happened you know I always try to tell folks ...\n... you know what my my main thing with with the liberals that I Know my liberal friends is when I when they asked me they say oh I don't understand how you don't know the countries in so much trouble or institutions they got all all\nBummed out about all this stuff really just you know Trump is destroying America and they they cry about it and they get really upset\nOr or them we'll hope they don't actually cry but they they want about it I Try to tell them you know it really doesn't matter to you as much as you think it does these things that you keep talking about you know are fraying institutions it's not going to affect your job is not gonna affect your home it doesn't affect\nAnything that you think it especially when you're talking about stuff like Russia collusion and but I I really do believe that there is a\nA big part of the general population that likes the anxiety of catastrophe that they like to\nCling to this notion that oh my gosh like this terrible things going to happen and I'm not saying there aren't real\nConcerns that we should all have you know first and foremost among them is you know we're all gonna die that's the truth that we have to deal with right there there are some real things out there to be worried about 'em you know we are probably going to explode our currency at some point and you know the our currency has a\nHas an incredible track record historically of always always leading to financial disaster as it has never been avoided currency leads to financial disaster there is a hundred percent\nA track record of this so you know that's a real concern\nA disease that is in terrible because of all the antibiotics you know especially antibiotic resistant bacteria in a mass infection or map mass\nViral play things like that that's real concern and day to day concerns are very real you know how you get along with your friends and family and how you doing the work but the concerns that liberals obsess over or delusions\nOr this notion that the planet is going to die and I mean that quite literally the entire planet will die unless we start making insignificant modifications do our day to day lives are with regard to shield to admissions that's crazy\nThat it's not based in any reality that's not a normal thing to be worried about but it's not a normal thing to think that just bonkers\nAnd when you start to look at the other things that get liberals really upset and Russia collusion and election security and all that uh they they are worried about things for the sake of worrying and many cases but the problem is they believe that they don't know that they're doing then\nSpeaking of a of of uh you know very real pie DSD uh I saw you know in in one of the opening sequences of picky blinders which is an

argue with you\nOn line five Ninety\nRadio ... euro Fox News multiple fatalities after man opens fire at a synagogue and Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood\nHad happened during a baby naming ceremony a gun and reportedly shouting all Jews must die before opening fire at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood went to his ... director of the Pittsburgh department of public safety\nThe are ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting that it's still McGrath bomber the make America great again bomber which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case will you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter as a congressional baseball game the senior shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do that's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nAlso was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American\nName is Caesar says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a talented Filipino\nThe media always though quick\nTo say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of him in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have out of Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just to picture the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a band that looked like that and nobody suspected or even years ago where they are a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican in twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs\nTo people we return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual sent into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this because there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that in fact\nI can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump you if you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist and Islamophobia Xena fall but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for putting that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example every example example of that\nWith the media again playing the victim in fact Jemma concept from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or engaged over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be under the president you don't get to tell the president ... mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nBetsy responsible or by the way the the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or an American Indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhen we do know is he was some promoter for shipping veils\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the leftist trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw is not go there observing and tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews\nI might take some false led called ...

County Arizona he is a right there on separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border\nAnd deals with the illegal immigration overtime I Want to know how he's preparing for the caravan heading this way and and what exactly it is the law enforcement is willing to her has to do as it gets here a sheriff I appreciate you how're you\nDoing great thanks for having me on\nIllicit always appreciate it really had a good time with you at the fair and get together in Washington DC\nGot some great knowledge I have to wear my cowboy boots next time I played a shrimp um six one I could do for his standing next to you but ah it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially you know watching you out there on live TV I saw out they're interacting with the people in the community and I love the way that you take the job on a lot of people\nI've seen police officers you know guys like this to\nWho walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't think I've seen some who I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to do I'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together\nBut at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm gonna see at the store these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what his what ... is going on in their life to put him to this point yeah so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect that we've tried to go from there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that humans can attract more flies and then you can then ...\nAnd in watching you in Iraq that again is sheriff mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you figure percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand that you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police but is there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it's probably about ten percent of those things\nAre just difficult to deal yeah and that you know I'm a I'm a believer in calmness in power if you walk up your calm and they can feel that they don't feel you're amped up it just it really helps that situation go a lot smoother image you have to rest\nAnd ended up going to last forever but there's some people that have just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and that you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching your chair of mark limping out County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like like pd and others um it is that when you walk up\nYou're generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you'd probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to where you could still get them home tonight that you know it's kind of it's\nI didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and it we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\n[laughter] just relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think if you just stay calm which work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discussion but you're right and if we wanted to we can stack honest on charges too so it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nBut you're from law enforcement guy and I say that\nI guess it's a compliment but it's also your job I've got people up in Travis County Texas not far from where I Am a where the where the share of just doesn't care about enforcing the law I'm going to ignore those laws owing force these laws you seem to be a guy that says no here's the book this is where the laws are I'm going to follow those I'm going to enforce those going to make sure people abide by them\nWhat reaction do you get from people in our county the residents there last question marketing appreciate the time or what reaction do you get from them when you say if and when they get here and we're going to make sure that we we you know stick to the laws are in ... is there a sense of nervousness among the community now with all these people had no way\nYou know we're very supportive community because we deal with it so much you know in this county everybody understands the majority of the people understand the immigration issue where with\nCars running from us almost ... almost every night were given the drugs coming into our community are you being affected by heroin and by a by ... by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our American public in our youth hooked on so\nHere in Arizona and here in our county we get for the most part you know and uh so we get a lot of support and they they expect to be I was voted into this position on those grounds that I was

guy working on tax code words ... playing with President Trump or we talk about the\nThe the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke\nAnd also about what is this new tax cut plans we keep hearing about Kevin I appreciate you how are ya\nHey I'm good thanks for having me on\nYou know what what an incredible time we're living in right now I Want to get it to the incredible succession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to knock today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI\nShows was this idiot but sent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you from yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously these guys had a history of uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that frankly um and I don't know what to greet how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a lawn right let me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and you know I I took a Ari Fleischer his advice early on and said you know similar stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and now to this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that um ... is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him the demography bomber they're calling you know for our good bomber ... new people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a\nSeemed a shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is a Joe I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes and in fact the coach after batting practice or after it took a swing ... do you want to take some ground second I looked out\nThe was take them I Know I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just well a foreign minister the head of the shootings so uh this is a media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nAll be blamed president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric\nThey often um are filing when you hear Hillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder a media analyst\nYou've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen I mean we we we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to blame the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know I it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished\nTo what Ronald Reagan accomplished in the fact that thirty five forty years later the media looks back on a regular ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point well thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that are ... the economy for decades in the United prosperity\nAnd rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to\nYou again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair or it'd be the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your Joe I Want to come on but I only have two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every American who pays taxes got a break\nEvery American who pays taxes has a bigger paychecks many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no manufacturing stuff here again or promising yes to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success says\nThat we got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas are manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and and in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest or economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never had a year he broke three percent um uh for the entire year here because of an more good news again this morning in the

last caller was talking about um went shooting how how do you get that\nCircuit typically forget I mean go there a whole nother story in movie theaters and other other churches ... how would you get your\nHey I can sort out the bad guys again the good guys and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy you know I certainly when I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility\nRight not only protect myself but\nAnybody that might that might come under attack\nAgainst the bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry at churches but that that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas do allow to in many places but at the same time there are also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is that if you're not going to allow me to carry my gun in\nAnd you should but if you're not going to allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun that you weren't to to get a license for and you've gone through the classes for a and then there's no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado\nThat guy quite literally avoided six other theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns\nBut once the interview tack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their twelve people died\nSo we are I think that you have to work in conjunction synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing they don't\nOr they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance an exit\nThis way anybody getting an are getting out or anybody get a good mood can be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility\nAnd they want to cause harm you're gonna you're gonna identify them before they can pull the trigger one gun\nSure I mean I guess if they can do it at Disneyland they can certainly do it at a church\nWill they will be doing it in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so so the people that\nWe pay to be our legislators or representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House you can't get anywhere near the place until you have a full body scan so why can't they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like obviously that economic a\nFull body for example or even a metal on you know those are those are the item that it's not just a that have an accent the people around them and in a church probably qualified people that are\nGoing to be there any way to get out that kind of thing but then there's\nTraining in right now I just\nFeel like it like I said it's not just I don't disagree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost ten more ... think that it's not a realistic I yeah\nWell I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if you allow concealed carry by guys like you and me congregation members that people know and that we know have have gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like that also you you just have a bus system where you have to be opposed to the to be let it I think that ended up itself could save some lives\nWithout a doubt it's a one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... when we come back [noise]\n\nOn

unfortunately in the state and got blown out of my seat could uh you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president on their loyalty to the president\nYou know I did some a media this morning I was on CNN and trust them when I said that I called the president a liar not what I said the president is telling the it's like that and he's covering the truth\nIs doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rocker\nAnd it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've done work at CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean when you walk and it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize that there is a definitive spin when you walk into that ... did you know you were to get you know some some left hooks for now\nHard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think that we're really hitting these that horror this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figured that could kill me with the base but let's find people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to say listen I get fired Fifteen months ago I was it loyal to the President Joe you would have figured it out by now or I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise]\nAbout my relationship with him do what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a

guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... short for packing we will so why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like everybody I gotta tell ya my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so it was the president of these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite\nMedia in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they sent it there's micro aggressions pregnant president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional feeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you\nAre and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they are offended by right\nThere was a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a\nStradivarius that he does a ... and\nThat's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and by the way I don't mean anything by it I'm ... my personality\nI agree it's embodies or move to the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now go and get this great book\nLet's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he says he's running for president were you a surprise I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty ... were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there's a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies\nAnd you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so we kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely looks for a cost to now and tries to tell me your fake news\nThan it is an enemy turn in a cost to eats it up he does it every time you make fools himself when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but again I bought but it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but um when you were in that job did you think that the media would work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought that would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what Adam ...\nAnd the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe ... era as a press secretary I did the first press conference and I told her that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the ... plant\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets the context of\nEvil as being very of Secret Service and flattering to me any begging me effectively to do a profile story with him yeah trail me around I was like well I'm not the bad and I'm not their self promoting myself run I use of expletives which I obviously regret\nShe loved that got it changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\nIn you know exaggerated article and then he really ... you know four or five days later ... and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want to the ambush in to see if we can get him out of the White House ... and you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping the president so what's\nThe other one I thought so if you went back to the right but\nIf you went and checked out the pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't ... who's going to be very direct you're going to be very straight with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with the ministry Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I

win if she kept talking unfortunately for you I have\nThe microphone and I have control\nOf of what's being heard at any given time I know I have a decision to make either both of us speak at the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to your either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking\nUm it's not going to be both ways now I Am a fair guy that I'll stop and let you continue but it's going to make allegation of drug allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to ... because there are there are a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true\nIn fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... it was one of my focus just not true of the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people are very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very\nLoud debate debate an emotional debate there are very uh there are bad people on both sides they are very fine people on both sides\nThat it'd be we're talking about is whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues to Confederate a war heroes of soldiers\nOr leaders that's what it was about cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments cause they feel like they can and they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yep\nOr they're good people on the side of Jared Jared down sure or they're bad people in that side absolutely so he's been he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listening to CNN and MSNBC and and the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled a reporter is also ally yes the reporter does have\nWell fortune where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms worry I guess I don't know what the ... went to ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this and when he talks as have stay like that that he doesn't have the full mobility over his hands in his in his forms as as most people do\nAnd the president went through I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of been his hands with a similar fashion and made you know spoken to in a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't mimicking them that way\nAnd be very good of you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before you even consider running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when reporters didn't do the report until two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not\nSometimes he acts like a door that way the president and he does have that way and he speaks that way do look at me and double trouble um stupid or something you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're gonna do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant would hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and we're not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker what's fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide to know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you\nYou may in fact to do more than I Do but you failed at any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level with anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in

frenzy the frenzy to the media is engaged in right now to make this the biggest story in the country\nAnd just skip over what's going on with us troops for example in Afghanistan and place we're still at a at which were still in the war\nUm we don't hear about it do we we don't hear about the fact that we're in the process of slowly losing that or they don't want it they they don't talk about that anymore or\nThey want to focus on this issue and I would say it's not just because they do feel journalist ... special affinity for other journalists right that this hits home for them\nNot so much during the Obama years when Obama was pulling the phone records of journalists and listing on the OJ charging sheets on indicted co conspirators as you know journalists\nBut you and that was Obama oh

president I'd states leader the free world\nTo do something that could upset the balance of power in the middle East that could have long term ramifications and they don't care about any of that\nWhat they really just want is the opportunity to criticize the president for inaction and then dump all over him for whatever action he takes\nThese people\nDisgusting or disgrace none other than she's\nNational security propaganda is for the Obama administration Ben Rhodes\nChange this to the next level and you know it's once again it's always about Trump it's all Trump's fault somehow everything that the left doesn't like is Trump's fall play sixteen\nAnd the methods that President Trump is sending\nIs it there's no consequences and you have to realize is there's nobody else who can play the role of the United states to hold people like this to a tight\nWe are the world's oldest and most significant democracy and we're not ... if we're not standing up for this there is not somebody else is going to do that and the consequences that are journalist everywhere are less safe\nAnd and let's face it we have a president and fitness and they're also they say to a values like

this at all they're not okay they don't say oh All right you know because Penn says we just need the facts and will hold them accountable they're not they're not slowing down all they want to jump all

bit\nOkay there there is not an independent press in sort of your people say oh buckets been getting a little better news yeah whatever\nTurkey doesn't have an independent press in fact the country workers Shelby was from what we see from what we believe murdered is one of the worst in the world when it comes to press freedom not Saudi Arabia turkey bad when it comes to press freedom\nSo when we say it's an attack on a free press yeah we live in a world where the free press is the exception not the rule lotta countries have all kinds of constraints on what can be printed what can be said what can be shared lots of countries\nAnd even countries that you think of as having a free press maybe ... some of the western European states for example they have\nRestrictions based on\nYou know hate

going to grandstand every time and act like anyone who has any questions about just bringing a ... whoever wants to come in this country can say she ultimately here's the problem\nThat the leftist project the really the socialist or the Democrats socialist project in Western Europe and in America because there are a Democrat socialist year as we know who the senators and others Elizabeth Warren but she's got other problems right now\nThe problem that the Democrat socialist project has to face is that they believe in open borders but they also believe in a welfare state a massive welfare state that doesn't work the Math Doesn't add up and also people are\nWilling to help the less fortunate from within their own community from within their polity right their political union there is still a sense of nationhood of nationalism should I say\nWhere you want to you know I I Want to help Americans first if we're gonna have a welfare state in this country it should be to help those who were Americans\nAll races grades and colors help them if they're down on their luck and we're going to have welfare state that should be but if if we have a policy of essentially anybody who shows up and has a ... a sob story about how their country has not I'm not talking to people that just generally that are facing any imminent violence they just say oh\nThe jobs here are better well guess what if I show up in Switzerland and say hey that I like this place better it's cleaner it's more civilized I demand citizenship they're going to put my button on a plane and kick me out of the country

fair to them because we don't do enough for them\n\nI was under the impression that if you came to America you're supposed to feel grateful and legal immigrants by the way of you listening Hi five

corn and we we're though the please yes there was a natural economic reset that occurred Obama made it slower and more painful and less powerful than it would have been had he not gotten in the way but he was\nIgnorant of economics I mean Obama is just not somebody who understands business not somebody who ever had to look at a balance sheet for any length of time not somebody who had to run a business of any kind you know he was in the business of Obama different\n[noise]\nBut the facts facts cannot be allowed to get in a way of the left is narrative with all this stuff this group is going to come to the border\nAnd they are going to be in a position\nWhere we can either let them in or not and you know what the liberals are going to say let them in\nAnd we're going to turn around and say hold on a second but if if their claims of asylum allow them entry in this country what we're really saying is that anyone can come and stay as long as they want anyone is allowed to show up in this country and we are effectively have an open border\nBecause all that all that's required for someone who's to say the right things now the word is out now we know what the loopholes All right now the people in these communities that are coming into this country no that all have to say is I fear violence in my home country\nI fear violence I mean violence can happen at any one country there's a

want if they told the truth to Americans and we'd have a\nWay to have a lot of folks would say a whole lot of second I don't think that's gonna work I don't think you can just bring in endless amounts are foreigners\nNot through the legal process not go through the normal channels of assimilation that had been in this country for centuries now or join this community that now liberals speak to

Twenty one trillion dollars in debt I'll talk to you more about that later on in the show bringing people without a high school level education and without English language skills by the millions is

Trump's orbit I've read today that they think it was about Michael Cohen's finances they had the wrong Michael Cohen though there's more than one a and\nReleased this information to is believed buzzfeed news and bust be of course then there's this whole story now that's not confirmed yet but that is what I've read they think happens here\nI'm so quote the criminal complaint against ms

the Russian ambassador in Washington a unit of rivers on holding a Russian company entangled any money laundering case\nBuzzfeed reporter who isn't I okay it is a budget isn't identify the charges is Jason Leopold who was listed as an author on all twelve articles cited in the complaint\nSo here's a woman who is taking\nFinancial remember these are folks this is not reports about crimes did you say is these are suspicious activity reports this is the equivalent of releasing raw FBI background investigation and then using it for a report oh you mean look kind of like the stuff you might get for the ...\nBut this is highly confidential legally\nProtected for good reason because you can destroy someone's business with this oh yeah you're so and so it's got a few a few suspicious financial transactions you know what that means\nNothing it means the government flags it and then they might look into it a little bit it does not mean that anyone has broken the law in fact the vast majority of them do not involve\nLaw breaking but here's somebody who forty year old woman\nThought that she would leak this information to the press to hurt Trump and his associates that she would break her oath that you would violate the law and ruined her career and now I now probably her life along with it\nBecause it was just as that important to try to get Trump\nDo you remember anybody during the Obama years from the federal government who was ... it splits should lead to go after Obama and hurt Obama do you remember anyone who was leaking classified information or sensitive information about individuals and businesses right\nThis is stuff since then reports for our own on anybody this isn't even intelligence world stuff is there are there can be a suspicious financial transaction just because you put a thousand dollars in cash in the bank you know maybe a lot of banks sale\n\nThat's why they keep this stuff so close hold that's also why the IRS actually tries to protect people's information because they understand that if ... if it gets out there it can do a lot of damage that people's reputations will be harmed by this\nSo you have to wonder how many other federal government employees were willing to break the law and share information with the left wing press to embarrass the administration members there was a from what I understand\nThere was nothing in any of this that tied to Trump was just people around him understand this though it sends a message\nSense it very clear message if you worked for Trump if you work with Trump\nYou could be the subject of this kind of government activism somebody within the bowels of the bureaucracy with high levels sensitive access could decide to release information about you too I'm not saying that will happen to you but now it's something you have to think about isn't it and it's not just\nPeople that have worked for Trump how vocal you're going to be in your support for Trump how willing or you to stand up publicly and say this and then what is the cost that you would encourage you'd be willing to incur in order to continue speaking yeah they are waging a form of psychological warfare with these kinds of

stuff that makes Senator Rand Paul's wife sleep with a loaded gun under her bed now\nThis isn't a one off these people are doing this stuff who lead the conversation between General Flynn and the

regular basis and no one said anything about it really was the one network that stood against it and\nYou know that they're saying that because Trump is critical of the press because he expresses his

in foreign countries for as long as they're journalists new but this is all the anything\nBad that happens in the world is Trump's fall to the left anything bad that happens anywhere in the world of any consequences you can say it's Trump's fault if their sexism somewhere it's comfortable it there's racism somewhere at Trump's fault if whatever may ... dictators desperate stressful\nThey get past the fact that as I said to you yesterday Obama's inaction and did the ring and cowardice as commander in chief contributed to a half a million people just chewed up in the meat grinder that was a Syrian civil war horrific violence\nAnd you know Obama was is nowhere to be seen in terms of leadership nothing if anybody made the situation worse made sure that there were arms that got into the

Dr G good guy when he said I can see the people that are always talking about trumpet so cozy with dictators he just says look at the actions look what he does I mean you know Trump has his way of finding gray sheet him so he's trying to do his own high level diplomacy with these foreign heads of state\nAnd this whole standard that they set up is nonsense a standard that you know Trump path to talk or you know super aggressively to everybody and he needs to hold to Nick how this\nIs nonsense this is complete and utter nonsense\nBut this is what they pretend is the new standard under Trump that he that he should go into meetings with food and then Kim Jong on these others and essentially spit in their faces and anything short of that show that he's a coward anything short of that shows that he's a bad guy\nOr you know they're they're not operating in good faith and I think that's really essential we can't lose sight of that they they're not criticizing the\nPresident because they really want to do something differently it's all just an excuse for Trump rage that hey Trump that's what this is whether it's foreign policy the economy immigration every criticism of Trump from the

hearing about the enthusiasm to blue wave but I think we have tremendous enthusiasm\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm\nAnd I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough he uh he is I could tell very optimistic about how is looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's I'm really feeling when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people on the campaign trail\nBut you know the this is going to be very close it's going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview uh think of that same interview that that is really got me a concern and it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nosedive and if if\nIf it's cyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on

uncharted territory here starting in two thousand or ... or so and I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even the debt Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached the point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is\nAnd then around the country and sure enough\nI'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be\nSome rough water and that's a very gentle way I think of saying it as a result of unraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things

prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily way political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your cue John and uh all these other groups out there these far left wackos\nAre considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um\nYou know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do have a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does that all the rhetoric but they liked that they view themselves as resistance to Trump bright they like it they view themselves as\nA opposite oppositional and willing to take action about all of\nThis and with that\nUh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nReset right if the debt turns into a crisis gave all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and

Fox News President Trump hauling the first time a series of rallies is less than a week to go until the mid term\nFlorida\nSins of the United states and of the state where in they reside so this this came as as a real um trio of a civil war\nAmendments including abolishing slavery on the thirteenth amendment the fourteenth amendment which does a whole bunch of important stuff including that and of course the fifteenth amendment a which says that the right to vote cannot be a bridge based on race so\nI'm I'm trying to understand what it is that they were trying to achieve back in what was Nineteen Eighteen sixty eight with this amendment ... it was it so that anybody who immigrated here and had a baby would become a United States citizen\nKnow the primary thing they were trying to achieve with this particular clause along amendment issue as you know we're just talking about the first sentence of it which is called the citizenship clause\nIts purpose was to ensure that African Americans who were born here even if they had been slaves or were uh were treated us citizens as you know of the United states\nAnd just for refreshing my my history even those slavery\nWas legal\nUntil the thirteenth amendment importing slaves was against the law correct at a certain point\nThat's correct and that raises a whole host of very interesting issues because anybody who is imported between Eighteen away when the slave trade was made illegal and Eighteenth ... sex when slavery was abolished\nThat person was an illegal alien and um you would think that ...\nNot a not a ... none of his own shoes\nAnd all of his own show he's in the country illegally and so you would think that Congress would have taken that into consideration but the\n... where there are a lot of I'm Sorry with a lot of slaves who were smuggled into the United states after the ban on importation of slavery wildly\nBuying a lot I I don't know that anybody really knows we no ... no certainly that there were such person and that they're not and that their presence was known about but the people who drafted the fourteenth amendment you know they weren't like the founders of the U.S\nUp the founders of the people who wrote the original constitution were extremely precise\nAbout the language they use their extremely competent draft\nA lot of people who tell you out there that language and the original constitution is vague it generally is not what the fourteenth amendment was not as well drafted and so I'm not even sure that the people who drafted it really knew what the phrase\nSubject to the jurisdiction meant in completely they they did understand that if someone was let's say born in Indiana tried out in Montana Territory before it was a stay at that person would not be a citizen I understood that\nAre they understood that someone who was born in this country was African American even if he or she had been a slave would be a set of\nBut I don't think that they fully thought through all the implications of what subject to the jurisdiction there of means and selling Supreme Court has had to struggle with that phrase on two occasions\nAnd only two occasions says this is a law that's been around for what a hundred and fifty years or an amendment and it's only been looked at it from the Supreme Court twice\nExtraordinary isn't that a but there's a lot of ... there are a lot of provisions of the constitution like that\nBoth of the cases that interpret that language subject to the jurisdiction there off off of them arose in the latter part of the nineteenth century one held that I'm a Indians who were parts that were members of tried\nA out of the territories that they were not citizens now they they were later granted citizenship by statute but they were not subject to the to the jurisdiction of\nThe United states for first up there 'cause that's that's fascinating fourteenth amendment and the fourteenth amendment that's I just want to make sure I'm I'm up to be with them so when the fourteenth amendment passed\nIt did not apply to Native American Indians\nAnd that later on by an act of Congress they were made into citizens but even even those people who were born in American territory because they were on a reservation whether they were an Indian Territory they weren't citizens of the United states\nThat's right the tribal tribal members okay I mean if somebody was in India and voluntarily left the tribe and came to you know be an American citizen that that was different\nBut I Try tribal Indians were not citizens the second case dealt with the question of the children of illegal immigrants\nOh what happened here was that there was a Chinese couple living in California in San Francisco they were here in this country illegally and they had a son and then the son left the country to go visit China came back and the immigration authorities wouldn't let him out and they said you know you're not a citizen\nAnd the U.S Supreme Court said he absolutely it\nSays ah that because he was born by legal that's right and what it was that ruling they set those uh that that's a Eighteen eighty four and so that I'm a that decision held that people who are in this country illegally\nOurs are in what the what the\nRob you're gonna have to hold that thought I got to run to a break but stay with us Robert Wilson is

Michael Brown here thinks listen to Michael Brown showing news talk five Ninety to see us Jay video conference\nSix thirty Jay how hard radio station [noise]\n\nThirty six minutes after I'm John Caldera in for Michael Brown does the president have\nThe authority any authority to say that\nThat people who were born in this country still aren't citizens if their parents are here illegally robbed needles in from the independence Institute he's our\nFellow in constitutional studies he says the definitive absolute answer is maybe the fact is we don't know and so all these people who are saying\nTrump has no power here Rob you were saying maybe but maybe not is that the the best short answer\nOther president absolutely come issue and interpretation of you know how he used the term citizen and the courts will have to sort it out\n[noise] what about somebody who is here a couple of on vacation or a woman's here on vacation and gave his first is that baby a citizen of the United states\nIf if she's here legally yes really yeah so\nEverybody who's pregnant should come here on vacation and that way their kid has dual citizenship right\nYeah there are um [laughter] doing rescue operation sometimes people on American boats have to ask the question gene or here's a woman\nFrom a different country and she's really praying and what are we do we put her on the American though because if she gives birth here ah she\nShe's a citizen rather than being hit as I said some\nIncredible it we've got some phone calls here let's let's grab a few of these let's go to Inglewood thrill three seven one three eight to five five Chris welcome you what John Caldera glad to have you\nOh well John thank you so much and I'm really glad that we have your guest on the line there are half a dozen amendments to the constitution that basically has a cause that read similarly that Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article\nThirteen fourteen Fifteen the civil war amendments all have that ... that clause\nAnd so my understanding is is that for example the thirteenth amendment does not free slaves it really gives Congress the authority to do that\nAre better\nDo the thirteenth ... unequivocal he freed the slaves it dog by itself right at the top and\nI have to say a German hang on basically let me take a quick shot at this in layman's terms it frees the slaves and it gives power to the Congress to enforce that freedom to to enforce that new new constitutional rights do I have that right professor\nYeah that's right and they're mostly but on the other hand if you protect that moved to the fourteenth amendment this issue of subject to the jurisdiction Ira ... the president would have the authority to\nGain to include within an executive order his interpretation of what those words means subject to the jurisdiction there off when Congress and force of the ... Congress could similarly interpret all the phrase as he had a team's best but the ultimate decision is going to be up to the courts\nOkay so I haven't heard\nPaul Ryan say this would be a question for Congress\nCould\nOnly tell them to get to see my Elena don't\nYou can also share than half a block on line [noise] teach them they can be more than a bystander and if they can help their ears\nMore on marine visit family doctor not one of our talk with your family physician\n[noise] your numbers guy but that wasn't a twenty thousand\nHow many American men down this year alone\nThe second most common can't\nOne is seven men one of five African\nOne and three you have a brother fought\nKnow your sat\nTossing a doctor vouch for profit health because they noticed that thought off today than a game like [noise]\nI'm Dr Kathleen you maintain with the American Academy of family physicians with important information on fire and safety\nFirearm injury happen every day it was important to teach your kids what to do is they find a firearm\nWhether it's real or not they should always apply to simple rules don't touch boom way in Helena don't remember firearm injuries and one of the top ten causes an accident related deaths in children\nSafety visit family back or not or or talk with your family physician ma'am\nAs they can and wanting more every inch of the\nAnd I've been tracking bacterial meningitis shut down version that's my ... came to me\nBut I didn't get back on my dream metal then the Maryland and another nation of Sierra published author named him to run around the Paralympic Games when their dreams like me your money where the Americans\nIn here in children's miracle network\nYou're listening to the Michael Brown showing ... news talk side looney PCS Jay\n[noise]\nNine minutes of the top I'm John killed era in for Michael Brown if you'll forgive me called real three seven one three eight to five five seven one three talk\nSo surprise surprise when the experts on television tell you the president does not have the authority to do this with complete certainty he does not have the authority to\nDo to make sure that people who come here and have a baby who are here illegally that baby can't be a citizen well the answer is we don't know the courts haven't looked at it since the late Eighteen hundreds\nAnd that whole little of jurisdiction phrase has a lot lot to do with it so the beating force if they have a baby year according to the Supreme Court ruling back then those people who are not citizens\nI'm not convinced this is a slam dunk he can't do it\nThe way that the New York times and NPR will tell you to go to the phones three ... three seven more than three to five five to Denver we go Mike was with me John killed era so like\nI I Would love to see a lot more background that the example that Nader sing gave about uh the rescue boats\nTaking a pregnant woman on a like to know more history about when that sort of thing came up\nAs it always I mean I don't know that we can gauge in rescue operations that long and ... as it was it sort of default because the anchor baby concept was already kind of ingrained and so they just people that did that or is there some actual legal reason for it the last ...\nOr get it that the southern ... I think the point of what Rob Nielsen just taught us is that whole\nLegal principle hasn't been challenged to the courts for for a resolution since late Eighteen hundreds so anything that the president does\nCould start the ball rolling on what that really means so even by him making such a pronouncement via executives I'm\nAn executive order it could result in clarity on what the Fourth Amendment means as far as citizenship so I don't I I kinda hope he does it\nAnd and then just to be clear as far as the less concerned there is nothing this president can do that he has the authority to do yet if president before he put in more executive orders and the other incident yesterday think yeah it was fine or aid even\nBe in there right now yeah so uh but the last word in that sort of settings paragraph wherein they reside that reside word also strikes\nMe you know if you're here on vacation you don't reside here\nThat's why the the reasoning for it applying to slaves of course they reside here this was their their home at least you know I had been for quite a number of years they didn't just happen to be walking through on it you know vacation\nAnd that reside anyway I just think well I had\nI I think the resigned regular I I think that refers to pardon my my English at the nuns taught me\nBut I Believe that means of the state so in other words it says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and the here's the fund raise and subject to the jurisdiction there of meeting the jurisdiction of the United states\nAre citizens so this is the other part of the sentence they are citizens of the United states and of the state where they reside which means that if you reside in Colorado your Colorado citizen if you write and I didn't\nLike what if you're just you're on vacation and you have a baby you don't reside here you just happen to be standing on\nThat right by the phrase or moment I I missed the time when when I was a kid the nuns would have us um graph out sentences you have to do a graph you have to do this you do these lines and so\nThe where of has to do with being a state\nBut that that doesn't come into play unless you are a citizen subject to the jurisdiction there up so if you're not a subject of of jurisdiction therefore you're not as a citizen in the United states then that last phrase end of the state where in the reside\nWouldn't apply to that person graft right up to ... and it becomes you know\nThey could have just as easily left out that whole section of and subject to the jurisdiction there they they wouldn't have put it in there if it met anybody who has a baby on the soil it's completely redundant to put it in there if that was the meaning\nAnd let's remember when this was ratified when this was ratified it Eighteen sixty eight it's not like you could jet on over here to drop your baby off of it to get here was in or deal or unless you live right on the crowd really should go up or do I do like\nThe Canadian border you know neighbors\nMy buddy even him in to make to try to make the trip back then was not was not an easy thing so it had more to do with slavery that had had dry with with immigrant knows\nAnd those people live here anyway I just I think it's a to think that the anchor baby concept applies I think flies in the faith that negates any other immigration law you can have it just makes\nNo only taken or taking my call see when we had an anti really fast and they we got less than a minute you're with John Caldera Hi Andy\nOh a lot for taking my call I I'm\nA parent or their porch or traveling internationally are leaving the u._s. army us focus from Iraq sheen shrank are very few search your words from the scene young couples from\nA worldwide trees and and there's very parents that they just had a baby and they're giving our passports check ups to leave the country\nAnd here's his faith can carry a week old and I you know why\nWe're we're we're sure where you're shopping for for ... and then all of a process for immigration is\nWe I Wish the same thing and I got to run for the\n\nSprings Colorado is news defend double accurate balanced\nBy Casey as Jerry change their line you're one of our very first customers how during my own hair is easier than I ever imagined the best part I no longer had to sit in a salon and pay over a hundred dollars to have this done\nNow in ... when it's convenient for me and it takes less than an hour people compliment me on how great my collar is in my hair is incredibly saw in healthy looking\nInto say uh okay okay you you need you need to take a breath and not say such ridiculous stuff on air\n\nBut I treated out without article those you're on Twitter concede check this out I I I ... in response to her\nCompletely insane statement on air which he did that have to back down from and apologize because it was so dumb that it was indefensible but but in response to that I said this is not even the dumbest thing that you will see or hear on CNN all week\n... not even this week will that be the single most because we've got an election coming up next week ... people are going to try to out to one another on the left with stupid hyperbolic destructive nasty comments\nI said it wasn't the dumbest thing this week and I present to you to prove me correct none other\nThan Mr Don Lemon play Clipper too\nI keep trying to point out people not to demonize any one group for any one ethnicity but we keep thinking that the biggest terrorist threat of something else some ... some people who were marching you know tours of order like a feminine and when the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost of them to get into the country most of them tired you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border um\nSo we have to stop a theme and I think people and realized the biggest terrorist threat and in this country is white men most of em radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about that\nThat's right folks multimillionaire CNN anchor\nSays we need to stop demonizing people comma and understand that white men on the right or the real threat they're the real evil the real monsters maybe we should ban them from traveling\n\nI didn't make him saying I'm not taking his words out of context I'm just playing for you what he said on national TV and you can say about why there's so much for a while either you're focusing on there's a ... no no no he is\nRepresentative of the overall mindset on the left that's why we did the montage this is this is what these people this is what the other side's\nA laugh the Democrats what they think they really believe that they're not the problem at all when it comes to\nOverheated dangerous rhetoric and the other side is the problem dot dot dot because the other side's a bunch of evil racist Nazi began Dina fold you know ... ... with blood on their hands\nOh\nI see that that\nIs at the heart of why we're having such a a descent into political madness in this country they don't even have the self awareness that don't even have the ...\nThe the the honesty to be able to understand that you are not going to improve the temperature\nOf political rhetoric if in fact your go to position is that the political rhetoric is bad because the other side is basically Hitler\nAnd I wasn't exactly how many how many references to rights and you know the rights stack fires and Nazis and ever did you hear that opening montage\nThis is how they think about the other side and you know what it you know what it really drives a lot of this\nIs the success or the successes that Trump has and the relative failures of the eight years of Obama's and before it or that\nThey told us they being all the opponents to the Trump movement they told us that he would fail miserably that he was completely in over his head that he had no idea what he was doing\nAnd that we would all essentially they would be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible consequences of having Donald Trump as president\nBut you see\nWe have suffered the consequences of Donald Trump as president and it's suffering with things such as the lowest unemployment rate in sixty years the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rates of all time a booming\nEconomy a ton of investment no massive foreign wars getting started no crazy foreign military interventions that are going to send our bravest and best Americans into harm's way for missions that the powers that be already been clear on how they're supposed to end in what's supposed to happen\nThat's that's\nThose are the consequences of Trump ism and now that we've felt that for two years now that we've seen it for ourselves there's a desperation on the left what does it say about the judgment of some of the most celebrated\nNames in the Democrat Party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power in ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong all they can do is criticized Trump's words his persona his attitude\nIs tone a but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from either lied to his lied to his supporters lied to his base or\nFailed miserably no quite the opposite\nThey they hate Trump more because he is successful they hate Trump more because he is by his ability to withstand them and six she'd despite all of their efforts\nHe's in a front to the left very sense of self\nHe makes them feel insecure about their beliefs and on the left belief and politics are tied together in such a way that the true believers the left wing zealots don't know who they are\nIf they do not have their progressive virtue signaling they don't know who they are if\nThey can't believe that CNN is objective and the New York times is a liberal and you know all the smart people all the good people\nVote Democrat it rattles them\nIn a way that people that view politics really just as a as a system for managing conflict in a in a civil society which is what I think conservatives that have a good perspective on this understand it to be a don't feel as\nShaken up\nRight we see this is okay what are we getting how's it going what are the results we try to take a rational approach to it and and even if someone just passionate although I Can't say that's always the case\nI Do like it when Trump owns lives I find it very amusing I think it's very necessary to I think the media in this country will never be the same and that's a good thing I think the days of believing\nThat there is an objective neutral press that is the the center of our our media apparatus that never coming back that's gone now we\nNow we expect honesty and trends parents do or else there will be at least push back there will be a fight over it but the\nCalls for civility from Democrats the last couple of weeks as I've been saying all along\nHas been in bad faith what they want\nIs for conservatives it for Trump and for the right to engage in self\nDoubt and just stop fighting\nAnd there will be no reward there'll be no meeting in the middle when the right decides to stop pushing for its beliefs and what it thinks is correct and what is best for the country all you will have is the left exploit the situation for their own ends and then go back to what we saw for the\nEight years of the Obama administration which was rub your enemies faces in it at every opportunity right to the\nLeft under Obama took the attitude of no prisoners politically speaking they didn't just you know overrun conservatism for at least the first few years of Obama's time in office they overran the conservative outposts number ... all the survivors\nIt was rough\nThere was no good said there was no meeting in the middle there was no bipartisanship no triangulation nothing\nNow where do you believe that we should win it looks like there's so much more on the horizon that would be good for the country and the Trump could accomplish now we're supposed to listen to the opposition\nWas that based than anything that's worth telling anybody that I asked three three people that were we wasted outside of a bar who were just trying to pull my legs I mean what what what's going on here\nThis is how they do it though is how the left engages in his manipulation of reality and they really just wanted to make this even ... a more divisive moment make it even more difficult for the president\nOf the United states to be able to do his job here which is to try and help and he'll be American people by turning it into some you know batch Trump's session these people are a disgrace and you don't it really comes down to they don't believe that he's the president they ... they they don't accept it not my\nPresident you remember that chance on the streets they think that he's not just not their president but he is not the president period\nUnfortunately they are wrong but they're delusional enough

birthright yep\nOh I'm In it that in death coming up later on the show but just I guess that's kind of a U.S kind of a preview of the courts have never held that that is that that is the case that illegal aliens no court has held that illegal aliens\nOr should be given citizenship it's never been addressed by the courts before and when you really think about it that was clearly not the intent of those who wrote the amendment at Eighteen sixty six and why would that be the decision of the government now it makes no sense\nDo you consider people who are foreign citizens meaning citizen of a foreign country who are not legally in this country who are supposed to be removed from this country as soon as they come into contact with law enforcement and our government apparatus\nThat their children should be automatic or their children born here should be automatic citizens and it doesn't make sense why would we do that\nIt doesn't make any sense it was formed to give the birthright to this age children of slate\nWasn't weren't near the fourteenth amendment was what was for it was for yet that the descendants of slaves after the civil war was one and it was very explicitly for that purpose and it also at all no this later on it when you look at the way it didn't deal with Native American populations at the time and you know there's a lot of\nLegal ease here about the different jurisdictions in overlapping jurisdictions but it should be clear it's pretty amazing really that we'd gone this far without anyone challenging it and I I think Trump is absolutely right if nothing else we should have clarity on the issue I mean we should at least have the court's\nWing in and explaining and and I think that the problem here Charlie and this is where the Democrats don't really understand is that no matter what once again they are showing their chipping their their hand here and we're seeing the Democrats are in favor of\nIllegal immigration illegal aliens being in this country are you know they always take the side of illegals in every issue on every issue and Americans take notice of this\nI think I think our president is slamming it in their face and\nYeah he has

is on the ... this whole birther thing got me thinking about anchor babies when it comes to welfare all day because there's a crisis of a caravan coming and then two more caravans after that caravan\nUm what what do you think any idea of Trump freezing brand new welfare applications in light of this crisis until this gets sorted out\nBecause one of my pet peeve destroy a long long time is that people don't understand that a white in his country means your your ability and freedom to do something in his lap don't like to comment on a government desk and expect money\nWell in terms of

you cannot be a a ward of\nThe states are so you you cannot be a dependent on the state and that you know and that's that's supposed to be the way that we're in our immigration system\nIs set up as we

then benefits accrue\nTo that child so then you start and and it goes to the household so essentially the benefits start coming in for that child and they have to go through the adults right you don't

here on TALK by nine ACS Jay [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nThis is a perfect example what I'm Talking about here you have a guy who writes for the Washington Post Eugene Scott he eats weeded out to politifact today\nAre are white males responsible for more mass shootings in any other group you hear this and and white males they also associate with the right even though there have been a whole bunch of mass\nShooters who are white males that were\nIf anything political leftist but you know that this is this is what do you often hear I mean this is the story line this is the way that they will uh they'll talk about all this um and\nYet when you start to break this down and you say OK okay well let's take this guy the Washington Post ... let's let's think about this let's say white males are the majority of\nShooters in this kind of measures in this country um turns out that's not\nTrue it turns out actually mass shootings are essentially line up with what you would expect in terms of demographic representation of for all the different\nEthnic groups in this country but uh your ears would you find out they've never\nMass shootings but I'm an overall violence overall violence now you get into a whole other conversation about some communities have a much higher rate of violence in other communities but for mass shootings it's it's pretty evenly distributed\nUm but Ninety five percent of shooters plus I mean probably more like Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of shooters might be Ninety nine are male\nSo as a river that we're being told white males or the bad guys that we have to be worried\nAbout their the terrorists they're the real threat um that Don Lemon says that's what that other guy was a radio show I've never heard of jazz Ninety nine percent of shooters our our mail in this country\nCountries also Seventy percent white so if if let's say Ninety nine percent of shooters are male and the country is Seventy percent white but\nOnly fifty four percent of mass shooters or white then that means that there's a disproportionate representation\nUm of other groups that are not ... they're both issues so so what point do people at the Washington Post and other places think they're really making about this I mean what I remember I said it's pretty evenly distributed but there's actually some\nThe outlier here is not that there are so many are white mass shooters in the country\nSo why are they pointing to that I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity and when it comes to mass shootings is is in

George mafia are of more on from Charlottesville it's talked about so much in the media just goes to show you that they\nCan't find where ... where's this these white nationalist I'm always hearing about I'm not saying that don't exist and say how many are there really very very few\nAnd you refer to that as a rise of a real terrorism in the country and now that the biggest terrorist threat and people like that or people like this pipe bomber guy uh we don't have the TSA because of the pipe bomb or we don't have the national\nCounterterrorism center\nAnd the multibillion now going on trillions of dollars are spent on a security apparatus for this country of all kinds because we're worried about right wing\nNationalist terrorism we have it because of Islamic radicalism or less the in the post nine eleven security apparatus we have is specifically designed to deal with the threat of radical Islam\nAnd I know that right now we're in a little bit of a low the terms of radical Islamic you know knock on wood radical Islamic attacks in the United states\nBut that doesn't mean that that's not the primary threat and people who say this garbage\nAbout how the real concern the real terrorists threats a real threat of extremist violence comes from white nationalist\nOr or being disingenuous and they don't know what they're talking about I Know that there are major a major departments and agencies that yes they they do have a they do have you know some entities that deal with you know radical\nA neo Nazis and things like that they have very very little work to do day in and day out folks counterterrorism that's assigned to a you know anarchists and right wing nationalist and stuff they're not\nBusy it is the counter jihad his folks that are always very\nDon't wait until Black Friday for a great deal on the floor you want to get a great deal today and get a new floor in time for the holidays and lumber liquidators get a waterproof floors from just sixty\nFour since ... best selling hardwood up to twenty six percent off plus get pre Black Friday flooring deals like thirty two percent off bull barn oak laminate to do with yourself or have us install it for you plus get special financing don't wait busier local lumber liquidators store or lumber liquidators dot com today\nAre you looking to buy a home or refinance or existing mortgage loan United dot com were so confident we'll give you the lowest mortgage rate and if we can't we don't give you one hundred dollars and the lowest mortgage rate is just to start at\nLow United we don't charge any processing underwriting or junk fees what are you waiting for pick up the phone and called eighty three three oh you alone that's eight thirty three year loans or visit online that loan United dot com in one sense except when you're in a matter of fact I was looking at when central any trouble we prefer to go through the freedom to when I first read it can be rich but only like\nFive Ninety Casey this case was\nSprings Colorado is news saw dependable accurate balanced [noise]\nFive Ninety Casey and Jerry\nAnywhere else in a fraction of the price I'm going back on me dot com tonight [noise]\nDoing Dave return every Saturday and the third for the senior living today show so sure about seniors for seniors and this was the bill covered topics relating to hell independence and overall wellbeing of seniors right here in southern Colorado\nAnd you're living today is for us to buy the games and other five sponsors senior living today shall we do return early Saturday morning and said hey thirty [noise] leashes on cable news top five Ninety Casey is Jay\n[noise] five Tracy Esther was low and I argue radios\nDot com and on your phone with our high orange radiolab\n[noise]\nThe final sunshine ... Fox News President Trump in Florida stomach for gubernatorial candidate round status and Senate candidate and current governor Rick Scott resident telling the crowd why you think they should vote red\nWhat I see from our own side and you know I've very frustrated with us today but not not surprising at all [noise]\nYou know I Know he's not running anymore but you'd think that for all the time it's been a concern circles and here's here's Paul Ryan not a constitutional scholar not a lawyer but then again neither am I but\nI seem to know more about this and Paul Ryan among many other things in a more about the Paul Ryan a but here's what he says that the fourteenth amendment just one this is\nA very clear political and yes partisan issue right before the election we can count on on on Paul Ryan speaker of the house to come forward and this is what he does play\nYou cannot and ship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws ... and following the plain text of the constitution I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is among check illegal immigration\nThe fourteenth amendment is not clear in that the language when you look at the language leaves open room right\nSubject to the jurisdiction thereof as we've been discussing if your subject to a foreign ... is a foreign country can say hand that then that guy back over to us and we go okay he's yours\nWhich which jurisdiction is he really subjective\nI mean you know this is where he started to get it okay well hold on a second and and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American or you're traveling in France\nAnd and you're like a I don't want to pay any more American\nTaxes would you have to do when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country they don't do it in many other countries\nAre ... and you say well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm an French draw a French French joy on French soil or I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we'll say none of your subject or jurisdiction so you're an American citizen\nI saw a jurisdiction has not just about geography and that's\nWhere this gets ... that's what this gets more complicated and there are instances already where you could be born on us soil and you could even be are legally but you would not be a citizen right in the case of the sons of ah indoors diplomats who were born here and they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship\nSo that\nIt's a place where there's no clarity often the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed illegal immigration when he's pro DACA he's ... this huge huge increases in guest worker programs\nAnd has just been show wimpy end immigration for so long and for him when he's not running again to come out now and say this and just get a kick the machines do the GOP side I got to say I was I was pleased\nThat at least at least from was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see\nThat are here we go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing immigration loopholes and securing our border\nPresident Trump is completely right I'm Paul right look it's one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this and you know we had the courts need to take this up and it it isn't a Portage but that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here and yeah that's right we want people to show up and go and stay\nIn maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels wherever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point is to get citizenship here and you know birth tourism\n... that's clearly not what the law just but you know Ryan just can't help himself I he's the guy who clearly has all oh gee shocks I I think he is much more about Paul Ryan than he is about the party there I say and and that brings you back to how I don't accept this separation\nOf party and country because I think that the Republican Party is better for the country therefore I support the Republican Party\nIt's a you know they're bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just one other thing here for you I Want you to hear this is Joe Donnelly who's a who's running in the Indiana representative a or indeed a senator or other Joe Donnelly here's what he just said during the during the debate yesterday this is incredible liquid one\nWe want everybody to have a chance in Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that both on the campaign side and on the Senate side or state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job\nOr director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job than you could ever imagine [laughter]\nWhat the heck is this guy saying I mean\nCould you imagine every Republican I Know he misspoke but wow hey a producer Mike you there\nOh All right Well Bruce or might you know cigarette break\nUp a DJ brand it I just won't let you know that uh you're you're you're a white guy but you're pretty good at your job as what you do that doesn't sound like much of a government does the bread banks I think\nI mean brand and you you your your name is Brenda you're a white dude but you'd be amazed at how good you are at running the board for this show people would be like her\nYeah exactly\nSo this is what you get this this is the Democrats the best and the brightest both the Democratic party\nSenator Joe and Joe Donnelly this is this is what the other side offers up as a Republican did it that would probably be the end\nOn the radio on\nIf I die [noise]\n\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry

I'm going to read you now from the book of poems they say in the media uh\nYeah so this is where you see that they they have no actual principle that they are protecting or that there there are trying to Institute here because they're ... they're very literally there's been a interpretation of this clause\nLet's understand is it's just not it's not clear what that means and also to take a literal interpretation of the constitution also takes into account what was it meant you mean at the time right this is where liberals\nWho would do the right to bear arms you can have ...\nMillion in Brussels that's why we said arms yes\nAt the time it wasn't a are Fifteen it was ... but guess what it is arms and that's why it leaves it leaves open for what arms were then we're arms are now\nAh and that's why the press the press has any dissemination of information the press is not an actual printing press and the jurisdiction there oh okay well what does that exactly mean what does that mean\nBased upon the understanding that the time in what they were trying to achieve with this amendment with the fourteenth amendment\n... remember that the Obama administration\nUm first of all there's all this there's all this rewriting of history now about what the Democrats have been doing an immigration for the last Twenty years and here's a here's a great example um of of that you have Harry Reid\nOkay this was even before that this was Nineteen Ninety three but this is Harry Reid who was among the most powerful Democrats in the country until recently this is what he had to say about illegal aliens play quibbling\nKept making an easy to be an illegal alien is enough\nAbout offering a reward for being in a legal [noise]\nDo some no sane country within the\nIf you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child\nWe reward that child with US citizenship\nThat's right we do\nThis was like okay you know if if I Rob a bank I'll get in trouble but my kid who didn't do anything wrong you know my my baby when he grows up he gets the trust fund I made with the money from robbing the bank dishes\nIll gotten gains\nCould try to think of it any other way they want they try to go with other explanations of it but that's just the truth and you know ... now you have this debate over the fourteenth amendment of the fourteenth amendment let's just get right to it right now uh it's all about making sure that after the civil war is written in sixty six after the civil war\nThere was no question as a matter of law that African Americans would be granted or or had would even be granted we had a full citizenship and all the rights and protections that that can first", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Pueblo",

now\nIt's not right now it's going to be going in if he was\nGoing to in the field that will be like how long will it take you from the time you get all the responses back well your calculator\nSure it's we always try to a minimum of five hundred survey for a statewide poll of likely voters or we might up at a little bit will usually do that over two or three nights of dialing so I'm either going to a few hundred and fifty interviews each night for 'em and it will spill over maybe do a little bit on Wednesday night\nCalling center time right now is you can imagine Israel super tight rope and so ah the polling center going with on this when we use several uh we're gonna be dialing Monday Tuesday Wednesday\nOrder for the benefit of those the here are pulling five hundred people yeah I Will always pick your damn to you right now I can find an email or or somewhere where the chat rooms where people were saying how can you extrapolate anything just talking to five hundred people that's right\nThat's right no it's a common criticism I'm an IRS but there's there's scientific method there is a scientific method to it we we equate it to a bowl of soup do you need to drink an entire bowl of soup to know what it tastes like rather than one spoonful um\nIf\nYou ... you know in measuring a you know in in measuring speech well it's just it's simply as saying hey if it didn't work we wouldn't be doing to you know like turnout is going to be anywhere between two point three million to perhaps as high as two point six million this November\nUm how can five hundred ... you know interviews really be reflective what you really need to how to do is make sure that your sample is reflective of the demographics of turnout right 'cause like when I Do my poll it's not fifty percent Republicans interviewed and a twenty five percent Democrats would if ... percent Republicans do I did that\nIt would completely skew towards Republican opinions so you need it set that up by gender age range a party so it's not too old versus not too young ... I'm ... and those approaches typically as long as you've randomized your sample and it's not self selecting the participants\nWill give you a pretty good measurement if you know what you're doing of perhaps a where the election may come out there's all kinds of other hurdles a but\nAt this day and age is getting more and more difficult to measure voter opinion accurately in a horse race but so far so good\nSo over over the course of your years of doing this how has your from mobile phone calls to weigh on blowing cold if you see your point we're actually land like cold will be just like you're very demented was\nAbsolutely I refused to do a landline only survey you can't among likely general election voters it works for a Republican primary survey though however because fifty percent of a Republican primary voting University of sixty five an older the why\nHaven't we you've ... you've thrown at at least a dozen times tonight right you've got to fix that yes we do um I don't know how we you and I might\nJust to try to get rats are few younger folks to participate let alone you know like I'm going to get his Republican a chance to look Democrat primary voters are a little bit different sixty percent of female forty percent male consistently um but it's older to it I don't think that like oh you know\nFinish your point about the other really good to be that much younger group\nYes absolutely up but the bottom line is is a you know you just need to make sure that you're forecasting it properly and doing it right but land line back in two thousand ten you could get away with a landline only survey day\nI Would refuse to do a survey where my sample is any less than thirty percent cell phones Seventy percent landline sets the threshold because you have to understand the cell phone interview could be twenty two dollars per interview but the landline interview costs us only twelve dollars the reason being this goal yes like a cell phone number is much more expensive\nSo like we were hoping to do a survey of the candidates for Denver mayor next year road okay but the population of Denver it'd be more my minority and overwhelmingly cell phone you

control today but the problem is a lot of it exists in a gray area we need to work with the oil and gas industry local government environmental groups to foreign allies that to provide more predictability and safety\nJust say we at a time honored tradition tradition here in Colorado of a one energy policy that every governor from Roy Romer on has endorsed and it's been a great spirit of Colorado collaboration where\nGovernors have worked in concert with the industry a governor Hickenlooper during his time uh worked on an extensive mapping plan with the industry after\nTragedy and suit or and and he recently came up with an orphan or a way to cap orphan wealth or all collaborations with the industry\nUh and I think you achieve more working together then combative Lee and I'm concerned that based on congressman pose as radical extreme past when it comes to energy policies that he would work compatible with an industry that provides two hundred and thirty thousand jobs and thirty two billion dollars of annual economic impact to our state\nThank you we want to go now to our election partners we have with us Dominic ... twelve might laugh at ... radio and John Franklin to Colorado signed each panelists delve into specific topics and Dominic we'll start with you\nThank you very much Sean candidates a first of all I Want to thank you both gentlemen for debating uh we were senior praises in Colorado and set out today that you're doing so many debates and I appreciate that uh let's get right to it with these questions I'll ask the author of up to forty five seconds for your response was Mr Stapleton we'll begin with you\nFor people in the metro area of growth has become a double edged sword a\nCost of living in is rising that urban quarter while wages leg what specifically will you do to reduce the cost of living in Colorado give Mr Stapleton floors yours\nGrowth means jobs and jobs means growth they are inextricably linked and that's why I've said\nThat my top priority will be the fix Colorado's crumbling infrastructure for the long term we put forward a plan to do it a new a bonding mechanisms from the general fund a which includes sports gambling fixing our broken a medical marijuana system also ah we've done an analysis of Colorado and eight other states are now in states and\nUh and found out that if we actually spent the same amount per mile on maintenance charges are that these other states did we could have more than a hundred and fifty million dollars for bonding in the future\nOr this is in contrast to congressman pulses radical plan\nWhich simply a wants to invest in multi mode of transportation\nUh underutilized public transportation and bike lanes at a time when we have to be spending all of our money on roads and bridges bridges and roads a plus he's going to drive so many jobs out of Colorado and bankrupt our economy that we're not going to have the tax basis or to fix our road so he will solve the problem and the people will be moving out of Colorado they just won't be moving back\nThank you Mr Paul is\nWell you know it seems like Everytime Walker talks it's noun verb German polish noun verb jerk pull us I'm here to tell you about my plans are and look a we have to invest in infrastructure because while the growth is very important we need to make sure that growth actually works to improve the quality of life for Colorado families because what is gross being what do we have a\nThree per se or three percent unemployment uh and it's very low but for many families they may have gotten a race but your rent is gone up more you're Fifteen minute commute is now thirty five minute commute young families struggle with the high cost of childcare and we're focused on making more preschool and kindergarten options available and saving families money on health care\nSo it's about how could we yes take this amazing economic growth engine and if somebody who's created hundreds of jobs who started companies whose met payroll I bring that real world practical experience for the governorship and I can make growth worked for every Colorado family\nMuch post we'll begin with you this question in a recent interview both of you said that you would welcome Amazon H cue to coming to Denver bringing it's fifty thousand employees under the right conditions though what would represent the right conditions for Amazon me welcome back to Colorado about them to call red rather Mr Paul is\nYou know that's a great example because it's everything about growth writ large right it's in one package of fifty thousand jobs and it's the same issues we deal with him five packages of ten thousand jobs so it's really a question of where and how\nWe do it right we can't take that anywhere without driving up the already high cost of housing without increasing traffic on our roads but if you look at the metropolitan area and you work with large employers to attract them help create competitive areas where you can people can get to work\nPeople can live for doubly these are real projects that I worked on just delivered in northern Colorado in Sonoma County we partnered with the commissioners to do a forty acres of land exchange lake hill to provide real affordable workforce housing for people so that people who\nWork in the community in Frisco and in Breckenridge can also afford to live in a community that's the kind of out of the box solution that I Would look forward to bringing the caller Colorado\nMr save them over to represent the right conditions\nThe right conditions would be a Colorado economy that puts Coloradans first\nAnd that solves our infrastructure problems for the long term because the fact of the matter is we're not going to be able to compete for Amazon's business or any other big fortune five hundred company with our crumbling infrastructure and so I'm all for fixing infrastructure not just on an incremental basis but all over the long term uh and we also need attainable housing\nFor young people that are moving here are more workforce housing and that is going to require a a strong Colorado economy it's why I was one of the earliest supporters of the president's tax plan to more than Seventy percent of Coloradans are benefiting from if you make\nSixty thousand dollars in Colorado your federal tax bill has gone from Seventeen hundred dollars to a hundred dollars this is another difference with congressman poses radical extreme agenda he actually entered legislation to repeal the president's tax cuts uh\nHe he is propose only cost a hundred billion dollars a spending a and nothing\nThat would actually be revenues that would help grow our economy and you just can't wrap up debt Jared you have to find a way to pay for it if we want to have the economic future our kids deserve and\nKind of water you're just propose racking up debt your infrastructure plan one oh nine would put the ... state in three billion dollars of debt without a dime a new revenue talking out of both sides that are not true at all actually what what do you know it isn't\nA gentleman let me have to uh uh for a follow up do either of you support any limitations on growth will start with you Mr ...\nIt's not a question of limitations has a question of baking it worked for those of us are already here right growth should benefits those of us who are already live in this day I was I was born in Colorado a we're raising our kids here are seven year old he just turned seven John or just the other day and our ... year old daughter\nA and you know I Want this state to be amazing and yes there's challenges associated with growth but there's also opportunities associated with wrote to help improve our quality of life decrease costs for family save them money on healthcare say family's money on education and how many Colorado more livable\nMississippi than any restrictions on growth\nNo growth brings economic opportunity let me explain the why Jared poll is is the most radical extreme candidate for governor in Colorado history here's why Jerry you'll unapologetically propose a\nA state run health care system which is thirty billion at least maybe more uh I don't know it's thirty two trillion it's a federal level you authored at so thirty two trillion divided by fifty or you've said that you are for a hundred percent renewable mandate which is another forty five billion a year for free preschool that's another billion\nA and and uh I don't know what else you're for but uh you you have no way to pay for any of this uh in Colorado's budget I can tell you is a treasure Colorado is thirty billion dollars you're proposing tripling Colorado's budget obligations and have no revenues to pay for it well let me tell you is treasure how you pay for it here in Colorado if you're a tripling\nOur budget or this may not work at the federal level because the federal government runs trillion dollar deficits but here in Colorado we have a balanced budget amendment and so what happens is when you were tripling Colorado's budget you either take it out on the taxpayer by doubling his or her income tax or else you pass it through the legislature through a death of a thousand cuts on visited all\nYou know the mayor of Colorado to live and were lawyers for our kids chair here you're the one who ... agenda that would put our state deeper in debt or do hire oh my God you voted in my car can overwhelm every ... Scott Santa you're not talking over\nEach other we're not getting anywhere with having to go head to head in a moment Dominic\nWe can keep us really thank you very much a a German speaking of economy as they do not grow forever everyone has been through an economics class recessions come frankly we're overdue\nAt some point during one of your ministry Asians are going to deal with the recession in Colorado what specifically do you need to do as governor to protect Colorado with the eventual slowing of our economy Mr ... we'll start with you\nYou know somebody who's created hundreds of jobs and several successful businesses in several sectors I Know the importance of a diverse economy\nBecause we always have downturns in different sectors fortunately and hopefully not at the same time last great recession in Colorado was driven by the housing crisis and I remember hearing from so many families in Adams County ... county who had home foreclosures so there's a premium on having a strong and diverse economy we need to make sure we have a rainy day fund\nOr we can afford to plunge the date of the ... the state into debt has Walker Stapleton a plan would do under one oh nine we need to save money for families\nHe had some questions about transportation and growth Marty\nThank you Sean thank you gentlemen of the questions I have\nAre pertinent questions for the state of Colorado but in particular to ... news radio listeners\nAre dealing with transportation and growth in traffic I Do need to tell both of you gentlemen\nOr some would say the Colorado is population has exploded will it has expanded by Thirteen percent in the last decade the state budget\nHas increased by fifty seven percent if at the same time at the state did not increase spending on the transportation infrastructure that the population seems to require based on that growth so do you support a sales tax increase to fund road construction in Colorado and I'll start with you Mr Stapleton\nUm no I don't and the reason I don't is because even though I understand the need to fund transportation I'm concerned that less than sixty cents on the dollar of that money actually goes to roads and bridges I think our transportation needs are so acute in Colorado that if we're going to pass a sales tax increase we need to make sure that it's been on roads and bridges bridges and roads and not\nA multi mode of transportation like congressman pulses radical extreme plans for for ah for our transportation fixes and and and that's not happening in this and and not John ... Colorado Springs a great friend who's endorsed me uh he already passed through his leadership of\nFifty million dollars in revenue increases at the local level if he were to sign on to this ah Marty a Colorado Springs becomes the highest taxed I um city in the state of Colorado in terms of sales taxes and he trades of fifty million that he re through two infrastructure increases for Fifteen million on a pro ride a basis that deal doesn't work\nFor Colorado Springs so I I Would support something more well thought out which will happen when I'm governor the state\nAs ... you know a Walker said the buses and light rail and bikes are somehow radical\nAre these are actually weighs real Coloradans get to work\nAnd yes I work to deliver lane expansion projects along highway thirty six Westminster Broomfield Boulder worked a took a liver federal support for highway twenty five north and the level in Fort Collins area\nAnd yes we need to include additional options provide more freedom of transportation to allow people to save money and get to work quicker ... I'm a supporter of making sure that in addition to lean expansion we have different ways that people could get to work look\nI'm I support the concept of having a dedicated funding source for bonding\nUm I I the sales tax is not my first choice ah and I don't think it's it's it's good to go into debt to the two to three billion dollars without any additional\nRevenue which is what what ... Walker staples and we do for a seat\nMr polish I'll start with you on this next question you alluded to the bonding do you think that either or proposition one oh nine or want to enter a viable solutions and if you do support setting aside state money for road construction how would you make room for that in the budget\nOutlook so if I think you're talking about a scenario now where they were they both failed that means that it'll be up to the governor\nOr to really lead to pass for to be the future infrastructure needs of our state or which really affect our quality of life I mean time in traffic is not only over six hundred dollars a year and extra wear and tear on your car and lost productivity\nOr its time away from family and so I Will look forward to using the governorship to be a convene her and she pulled together and unite\nRepublicans and Democrats people from western Colorado southern Colorado Denver metropolitan area in eastern Colorado\nOf people across the spectrum including the business community to make sure we have the very best plan to prepare for not only where Colorado is today but also where we are with regard to our growth in her future I just want to add that part of infrastructure to me\nMeans Internet and high speed Internet access in rural broadband because when we enter connect our communities we enable telecommuting reduce health care costs through tele medicine and yes it helps get cars off the road because people have the ability to work from home and and and do what they do and support themselves your thoughts Mr staples\nWill convene earns and chief uh sounds like Washington DC talk to me we need a dedicated revenue source from the general fund multiple dedicated revenue sources that we can apply to transportation for the long term I provided them congressman Pulitzer is not\nA he's not providing any way to pay for transportation except to convene people I talk about the neat I I oppose uh when I was treasure a director botch plan to spend a hundred and fifty million dollars on new offices for bureaucrats while all the rest of us out in traffic or that was not a priority that I supported\n... unfortunately the priority of the governor and his and a priority that congressman polish supported a and we needed to actually spend that money on our roads and infrastructure and uh I Believe a ... that we need to solve it not just on a one year basis but over the long term even if both of these\nBallot initiatives path or they're not going to be enough money to fund our infrastructure for the long term I have a plan to do it he has a plan to spend money cost Colorado jobs in wreck our economy\nPhilosophical question is it the state's responsibility to build infrastructure and build roads or do you believe in some sort of public private partnership again was stable too\nI think it is the state's responsibility and I think manage lanes can work\nOr in terms of public private partnerships people don't like them uh but we need to solve this if we want to have the infrastructure that makes Colorado world class city that makes makes people psyched to move here from the east coast to the west coast and live their lives here uh we need a first class infrastructure system we do not have that right now we have a crumbling infrastructure system and\nCongressman poll is wants to waste money on on on stuff that is underutilized like public transit in bike lanes and and I'm not disparaging that congressman but we have an acute need for roads and bridges to fix I Seventy to fix like twenty five and you want to spend money elsewhere I actually want to spend it where we need it the most was travels well\nLook you you said that even one oh nine and one ten aren't enough money for a big spender Walker Stapleton um look\nWe we we only have so much money in this state and if the voters don't approve those were going to need to find other ways to pay for transportation and yes\nPublic private partnerships absolutely overall it's also a role in the states to make sure that they actually benefit people are and could provide the needed conductivity there's no way the public private partnerships can meet all the infrastructure needs of our state they only work along heavily trafficked quarters\nIn fact that's a big part of how we would pay for rail with the private private public partnership\nThat would ban from future ticket receipts there would advance the money to help conduct\nOr from the suburbs to the existing light rail system in Denver Transportation's about moving people are and when you allow people different ways of commuting whether it's light rail and bus or it's up to you to take them and if you choose to 'cause if they can get you to work quicker\nAnd you can save money on gas and on car payments that helps put more money in your pocket to enjoy the Colorado you left\nWhen a dove tail on that question in the sense in regards to mass transit the reality is both a gentleman no you're not going to be able to build your way out of this in fact the construction projects we have now you're building for two thousand\nAt some point something's got to give a and one of those answers potentially is mass transit you obviously both have different ideas I think a lot of ... Colorado into like the idea of having freedom as well but at one point do you maybe tells the electorate and tell people that you were not going to build our way out of this and you either have to accept\nSitting in traffic for Ninety minutes on a commute maybe have to move away or say the reality is you're gonna have to be to some degree coerced use mass transit and build that infrastructure out and invest in that\nPaul's oh look I don't think that's something that a ... year will be it would be a failure of leadership um if the governor were not able to solve this problem or we have the plan to do it and pull us we're Colorado town to build a coalition urban rural Republican Democrat the business community to make sure we invest not only in our current trends\nYou shouldn't have but we meet the needs of a growing state in the future and yes that includes multimillion will of course that includes freedom of transportation of different options that includes ... late expansion includes fixing our our bridges and it includes a difficulty discussions and uh\nI think Walker's oppose every funding measure but once the plunge the dates they deeper into debt\nJust to dig out of where we are today a I'm willing to have that discussion\nOr with Republicans or Democrats from across the state and make the tough decisions to make sure that we can retain that amazing Colorado quality of life and reduce your traffic not only on your way to work but even if you want to go to the mountains or the great open spaces on weekends Mr safe then you have last word on the subject\nThe last word is that for Colorado to compete as a world class city we have to fix our infrastructure over the long term and not\nA over ... in an incremental basis as been at the the plan for the last\nUh two times we've tried to solve infrastructure and we can't just go to the taxpayers and ask for more money all the time like congressman pose wants to do when I was treasure and my first term I passed debt consolidation it totally reorganized away Colorado issues its debt unfortunately the department of transportation and higher ed weren't subject to that had broad bipartisan approval congressman\nUh and we don't have the accountability for house the dog is spending money right now a ... and if we did we would we would maybe better understand why we're spending more per mile on maintenance and other associated charges then a more than a half dozen other mountain states and so I Want accountability responsibility and transparency in government\nCongressman Paul is just wants to show the taxpayers to pay higher taxes and and probably ... maybe as an incentive to move them out of Colorado thank you gentlemen\nThank you thank you Marty so now for the segment you guys have been waiting for a chance for you to question each other this time we're going to have some time limits around thirty seconds to ask the question and minute to answer and wait a coin toss before we started the debate tennis Stapleton you want and opted to go first\nCongressman Paul is I have a friend named mark ... he's a U.S citizen from Mexico he's been working for ten years plus in the energy industry he's actually just bought his his first house he has a happy life but you're working against them\nYou've talked about Colorado where his job doesn't exist you supported anti fracking initiatives you've supported anti pipeline initiatives or you've talked about rigging the game for a new rules to a hundred percent renewable economy where fossil fuels don't exist level with Marty when you make his job obsolete\nI think it's up to governors to play a role in building the coalition and what you have to show voters as they've done the most with what you have\nIf you're ever asking for more our tax plan would go after corporate tax loopholes in today's tax code and use that revenue we would hope to eliminate oh about a third of these corporate tax giveaways and use that to reduce the income tax on Colorado families by three to five percent\nSo if I heard you right you'd support some increases in the corporate tax that close those loopholes but you wouldn't support any other tax like during your\nTime that the tax code you worked for people uh and when we have ... electorate is a lobbyist that have gotten special special tax subsidies for them or I'm not backed by the special interest I'm not taking any Packer special interest money in this campaign\nI Want to you and Coloradans a and John that means you have a little more money at the end of your paycheck every ... every month because I Know you don't have a bunch a lobbyist down there in Denver\n[noise] just to be clear a group supporting your ... are taking a pac money or Mr Stapleton or you oppose the current ballot measure to raise taxes for transportation education would you propose a tax cut of elected and how much\nWell I definitely wouldn't proposed a tax increase in I wouldn't propose what Congressman Paul ... is proposing which has some pretty\nUh questionable math um he is\nThe most radical extreme candidate that will ever be Colorado's governor if elected uh because uh I can tell you Colorado's budget is thirty billion dollars today twenty billion comes from all of us are in the form of our state income tax and sales tax ten billion from the feds most of that money has been used for the expansion of Medicaid\nCongressman poll says promise nearly Ninety billion dollars Ninety billion to a hundred\nOr maybe more spending I'm from a universal state run health care plan that he wants to bring back to Colorado that's at least thirty thirty five maybe forty billion or his renewable plan a witch hunt independent research Institute said would costs forty five billion dollars\nA and free preschool which is another billion dollars plus and John as I was listening but talking to you I'm Still waiting for him to be candid and say how he plans to pay for any of this because this will triple the size of Colorado's budget obligations and you either need to pay for it congressmen we've had this discussion again\nA bike taxis people through the ballot or we ... the defense mechanism which I support or alternatively are taking it out of the business community bleeding it out and regulations and fees that either one makes\nColorado and mark talking planet that are not mind the renewable energy or all your mind that we're on our soldiers may not only a hundred percent are centered channel not my plan is not the plan is backed by any of the mainstream environmental groups for this final segment we'll start with John\nAll right we are running out of time but we want to tackle a few questions and a quick format the star stayed around so we'd like you to keep their answers as short as possible no more than Fifteen seconds\nUs attorney Bob ... told our rec Salinger that he wants the state\nUh before going forward with things like hot clubs and pot and delivery 'em to take a pot right now he says that um pot is leading to a rise in organized crime teenage used traffic fatalities et cetera and do you agree that we need to hit the pause button Mr Stapleton\nAbsolutely and we need to fix our regulatory model a which has broken with respect to medical marijuana we we're not going to repeal marijuana but we need to fix it and I'm not for the expansion of recreational drugs like congressman polls as well I don't think\nThe Troyer or other Washington DC bureaucrats should be telling us what to do in Colorado Colorado voters have spoken regardless of what you think it's in our state constitution and yes we do to make sure we do what we can to make sure it's safe we keep it out of the hands of miners are\nAnd that we make sure that we have the right parameters are around a market that works for Colorado\nPamela calf next question gentleman would you continue governor Hickenlooper stay of execution for a convicted murderer Nathan done let Mr poll\nIs again I don't think it's appropriate in a political context content on somebody's life literally a I Would consult with the victims I Would read the case on and make an informed decision to enforce our laws Mr Stapleton\nThat to me sounds like a non answer a I don't think it's the job of the governor to re adjudicate a decision that's already gone through the legal process and uh I wouldn't uh um I wouldn't live to stay immediately but I Would have a review process a over a period of time to make sure that a what a judge and jury decided ah was not change a re educated by a sitting governor\n... would you encourage the legislature to specifically direct school funds to race teacher pay just able to\nUh no I wouldn't until we got our administrative costs in line because uh we did an analysis of our hundred and Seventy eight school districts and found out that ah\nStudents have grown by six percent teachers by eight I administrate of overhead by thirty five percent\nOr if we just kept from two thousand eleven on administrative growth in line with student teacher growth in some school districts are we would have as much as thirty five hundred dollars more to pay teachers uh this is how I approach fixing or broken education finance model and and without a going to taxpayers for a tax increase Mr polls\nWell I think what you just ask you the answer is the way to do that right so if we\nHave additional funding from the legislature let's restricted to make sure it reaches the classroom\nWhich means either greater teacher pay or or smaller class size but reaching the classroom not being intercepted by bureaucrats or administrators along the way an yes well I think we need to honor local control I'm willing to tie funding increases to restrict them to make sure they actually reach the teachers and reduce class size for\nColorado families John yes or no question when you sign a bill to ban read by cameras ... know Mississippi\nI'm probably not no okay I'm annoyed by them or we'll sit\nSo we want to ask you both\nThat question at the end you know we always end our debates this way we can both to say something nice about each other wants to go first I'll go first\nI think congressman poll is is a a creative guy or with bold ideas he and I are firmly support or the future of kombucha or he's entered federal legislation to do so uh we're both fans of cooking I'm just concerned that his bold ideas are writing checks of Coloradans can't cash ...\nA well to have a ... some time Walker when this is all over together as you know we've worked on actually reducing taxes for the boots or industry nationally with our bipartisan bill um but you know a look I think that um\nI Would look to work with you and my minister ration is somebody who might be able to provide some creative financing solutions and I think we need all the creativity we can around public private partnerships around preschool and kindergarten and you've had some of those ideas in the past and I know you'll have a lot more going forward\nThank you both I was very nice which I had to say I like the positivity here in this debate\nGentlemen I Want to thank you for joining us it's an important chance I think to educate voters and I want to thank our panelists and partners friends to get to trial ... radio and the Colorado sun and six thirty ... if he joined us

that that would make sense for him because that would be a good campaign commercial for a twenty twenty presidents he hopes for\nAh for Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I\nTalked to guys last night I found the ah yearbooks from some of the angry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was the new year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar and\nI don't know about you but I Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went to school in those years in the late eighties and a book or\nWe call a cocaine was referred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator is there something you need to tell us and also the guy who said he had um\nA young woman at the age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called stealing second or something like that a book or a also had his senior quote was less\nGo all the way\nSo Cory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really an arrest as we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday it's kind of like being scurried off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home or you go back to the protests\nBut there is so much to get to today so much I'm just so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember what\nSparked all of this and it was Donald Trump nominating Mr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh and on the day when that happened Chris Matthews\nThe elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue in his role\nA Chris Matthews was on the air talking about revenge\nAnd I tell you all of this all of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of this resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats\nIt said when you go out and develop all of your missions in life based on revenge they tell you to dig two graves\nBecause you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth this year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nFish has time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance now with four and a half weeks for that wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their face and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't a Chris Matthews if you don't if you don't go after vengeance\nAnd he's talking about Merrick Garland he was talking about Hillary's loss or I'll I'll tell you talk about backfiring\nBecause the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today they sounded like a bunch\nOf people especially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great and great\nNow I I'd like to say this is a a a good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity\nIt's an absolute attorney so I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interests of those of us who are conservatives who wants to try and save the house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens when you get the house and the Senate and the presidency and the very next election the midterms\nHistory tells us it always balances out and the voters will get power back to the other party\nSo for the GOP to retain the house would be a little bit of a miracle but I have a plan and that will share with you I also want to hear your thoughts on today if you have any thoughts on that it's friday let's have some fun\nAnd I have a really ridiculous question for you\nI Know the other day I asked a\nQuestion about what's the what was the scariest movie of all time and a lot of you came up with great answers well today I reached maximum anger\nAt the worst jangle ever and I know\nYou've heard jingles it doesn't have to be a current jingle it can be an old commercial jingle one is the worst jingle ever you know it's an ear worm it sticks in your ear I'm going to give you money you want to call in with yours and you can sing it or you can ... you can say however you want but when I hear one\nAge seven seven times for kids I Want to stab my radio\nOne age having having kinds for kids and then they say donate your car today they don't say donate your car today they say de nay your and what the hell is done neck\nTrump tweeted friday morning about the very rude elevators rumors are paid to make

I think reason and logic and\n[noise] the system worked and it it didn't work really well because the only one Democrat out of forty nine Democrats is voting to confirm\nJudge Kavanaugh to elevate him to justice Kavanaugh only one out of forty nine that's not a good thing that\nReally is not a good thing but there is good news on a new poll out of Fox that says ah the things that are most important to people in the midterms the number one thing\nIs uh the economy now number two is health care and if you paid attention to date to Susan Collins or yesterday if you've been listening to President Trump in his speeches at these campaign rallies he is brought up specifically\nHow he wants to make sure the pre existing conditions are protected\nSo with the number one issue being the economy and the number to issue being health care the president a well he's already addressed the economy with the economy the economy's working it's bought off right now three point seven percent unemployment\nThe lowest since Nineteen sixty nine and companies\nAre now are actually working to more people who left the employment world to come back to work they're trying to come up with new ways to get\nSome of the women who left to go have families to come back to work there are trying to get people to fill jobs in the manufacturing sector\nTo come back to work there are\nThousands upon thousands of good jobs in both manufacturing and in the trades that are unfilled all you have to do is listen\nTo what Mike Rowe talks about if you don't follow Mike Rowe on Twitter or Facebook or visit\nMike Rowe works on the line Mike Rowe works all one word you're missing out if you would like to have a career that you probably never going to worry about being unemployed there are literally\nTens of thousands of jobs that are good paying jobs we're talking fifty to a hundred and fifty grand a year and\nThey are jobs you might need a little trade school for but micro works will show you\nHow you can uh get a skill and then go to work and my puts out scholarships for stuff like that so uh check that I didn't mean to get off track all also the fifth\nNumber one in all the top issues of what voters are looking for in the midterms to fit thing guns because Democrats are going to try and make gun rights again a big deal\nAnd Donald Trump is a I think Donald Trump is throwing a couple of bones towards the people who are ah kind of squishy on guns now I'm a Second Amendment guy I'm On a lifetime man or a member I'm a concealed carry weapons permit holder I'm a believer in getting trained\nAnd being sure you know how to operate your firearms and keep them safe but I also understand there are people who are ... bs another bonus word of the day today hospital a phobia you don't want to ... ... someone who when they hear the word gun\nThey immediately lose it I'm a little sister who hears the word gun and instantly her blood pressure goes up\nI could bite a pop tart into the shape of a gun and my sister would have a problem but the president has said he's going to sign something on bump stocks\nAnd if you are a fan of bumps stocks than a I'm Sorry but uh if there is a two\nLegal to own an automatic weapon a fully automatic weapon I think bump stocks are skirting that law\nAnd I think we could win points with some of those a hospital of folks if\nWe would say bump stocks aren't a good thing if you disagree with me convince me it's just one of those things that this gun owner the center a member is in lockstep with the president on it\nSo that that's where I'm at All right that's a couple of things are going on today 'cause we still have a lot to get two for the midterms and I will give you my a plan\nFor how I think that you can stay engaged and stay moving in the same direction towards the midterm because if the midterms were held a tomorrow or next Tuesday\nYou're living today's rushing by visiting Asia and other senior living today show with

used to be part of Massachusetts but that was one of the greatest duration try for it and I'm just real happy and that's all I can say\nDid you watch the whole thing yeah I watched it\nYeah I did you hear me talking about how I didn't see it first I listen to it on the radio and then I watched it later I was more impressed after it when I watch the cars I realize this GOP is finally starting to get his presentation act together you know the two women in the background\nThe whole set up was just perfect\nWell you sound like an old Yankee Republican uh that's what a what do you know in the past you know she she has been you know confusing but today I got to give her credit I mean Russia just beautiful\nYeah I think she laid out a primary fishy case and why this guy deserved to be where he's going to be hopefully after tomorrow and why\nAll of the ... and hollering while it should not be listened to as a legitimate criminal charges but she also brought up I thought I really respect the case for the victim the alleged victim here not a victim of judge Kavanaugh but if somebody\nI I was showing Presley and and I'm not usually as Susan Collins fan so that's a good now did you have a bad jingle to share with us\nOf course I Do I have to wash drink used to be the spaghetti ocean or commercial which one you got to go way back for that that's the neat round spaghetti you can eat

also wants to give Susan Collins a pat on the back test pseudo John\nHi how're you doing I'm gr are yeah I Wonder I Wonder if say that I think one of the reasons why the speech research skills or fearful is because it's a screw the truth to power I think that's one of the reasons why Trump are so\nPopular with people because we're so used to all these politicians just here said he wants to be doing something else you know the number of following up all sounds good come up to a lecture and probably somebody actually scripture and our heart is you know Congress there's truth to power\nBefore Trump that was a pretty rare thing\nAnd I think she tapped into that raised by you know ... some of the consistency these people\nAt the television and they're just like you know why or why would why would you go back to a party you know ten times reader people will be drug to raise that anybody would an ounce of common sense\nJust have to say you know this is and the one thing I could face the media is so close to it and I hope these people never get a new power look everybody goes votes don't you go that these people that the media it'll it'll drive you crazy [laughter]\nI agree it's a great point any jingle you want to share with us a bad jingle that haunts you\nKnow yeah when you just said that that other guy I was sick and will ... head which could have been that good stuff I guess I don't think it's around anymore it's just it's butter but it's not it ...\nOh my God if you think is ... by it but it's not a long term memory somewhere I say\nOh that's a good bad one thank you that's an earworm that's in my head now to have a great weekend sir I appreciate you Michael Palca infer ... than just around the corner and we're going to check in with match slap match wife works in the White House I've known that\nFor years from the pack and the American Conservative Union\nHe is a good conservative guy he's a Trump guy died in the wall and he makes a lot of sense will

on I'm rich Dennison Fox News ... senators announce who support for Supreme\nCourt nominee Brett Kavanaugh appearing to clear a path to confirmation made Republican\nSusan Collins after a lengthy floor speech concludes she will vote in favor of judge Brett Kavanaugh for a Supreme Court seat\nMike what a night to be with you\nYou know it's a it's a little bit of history I have to tell you I Am grinning ear to ear tonight at what a speech today from Susan Collins\n... should rich have look I'm sitting here with my wonderful wife mercy and at the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and I was telling her I feel\nYour article fear and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer\nI Can't imagine what it feels like for the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the rigors for very emotional and very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go forward not just for the party not just for the president not just for the judge and his family but for what Collins laid out is the rule of law and and America is the legal system I think would have taken one in the guy\nHad we not going forward and I know we're not done yet\nI Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours\nBut it's pretty much a feta ... and not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing is we had every curve ball thrown at us like this process uh I Do think that um\n[noise] America has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions and I think of course I'm a part of sitting on the conservative side as or you might but the I think that the the left has become so radicalized so eight skills and they would justify almost any action to get the ends that they want but I think the same\nA peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who have oranges\nCredit card Eli family I think those folks need to find a way to recapture their party because it's quite ugly when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days\nI think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I'm fearful that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is that if that's the case\nEvery battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a mad and I have a question I I have a personal question I Want to get to you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with\nBut I'm nervous that this victory happened too quickly too soon because we've got four weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\nYeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate for politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue\nIn the election and I understand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm goes but we have to think about this if we\nAs a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes\nIf we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to too many people around the country I've traveled to a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country until the same thing that if the Republican Party kids simply keep this problem is the most important have its promises\nThen they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of shared that as well I kinda felt this is a moment where if my party just can't stand for something then I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people who feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud and Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins\nI'm I sold it to grant a Fox is you know they give it a big huge hug and I've\nBeen a real critic of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated Donald Trump were never Trump first and have come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises I'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept their promised that they kept their promise\nTo support a constitutional is a Supreme Court justice uh then we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans and Trump supporters and conservatives most that coalition are conservatives\nI think that there's great promise now more promise than I felt at a very long time\nWe're talking to match slap or I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also all over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC\nMatt or if you would have told me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle\nWell let's talk about Mitch McConnell just for a minute here I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together and we had the majority in the Senate and when a Merrick Garland was picked for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell's doing kept those centers together he kept all of them together\nAnd that's why we're where we are\nWho you are a hundred percent correct he deserves credit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that he has ... you know not done yet a\nTomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee ticket shepherd shepherded through the Senate and under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a production I think we're going to have another one next year\nAnd a and if you thought this one was rupture sweat you get the next book is an excellent could be replacing a liberal and a and I think the stakes I think the charges will be even more outlandish and so it was the tactics\nWell I I Hope we have some lesson as you called for us to look for some kind of unifying moment and Susan Collins did as well I've been telling everybody go pick up Zell Miller's autobiography and read what Democrats used to be like\nYou know read about a guy who was a blue dog Democrat from the south who had reasonable approach is to a changing minds in different opinions and I think that's kind of the mold that the Democrats have lost complete touch with\nSo I I I'm pushing that in the time remaining that just quick question\nYou'll have like five daughters you and mercy have five young young daughters\nWe do we have five daughters have to actually write\nHow has this last three weeks been at the dinner tables in the ... house\nThat's a really great question because I've had a lot of pretty serious conversations with my two older girls and one is a sophomore in high school um goes to a high school that's kind of a sister school to Georgetown Prep and\nThey all fuel silver lined by the ah by the treatment of these Catholic institutions I think there's a real unacceptable a talk about Catholics of their institutions which were disgusted about and I've talked to my eighth grader and I've talked to them how\nThey have to be careful out there with social media and drinking and of course boys and you know all these little lessons of life which are really important to know but I also ah\nYou know what happens at our dinner table a lot is because they see their parents on TV which they think is really a kind of like the big deal but you know you gotta fight and I'll tell you what Brett Kavanaugh taught me this last couple of weeks that I wouldn't have thought that was this type of person as well as I Know he's pretty\nHe's pretty mild mannered you know he's low key\nBut you know what he did when they went to west to character assassination he fought back you fought back hard and when we talk about the around the dinner table we talk about that because they see their parents being criticized at the end we tell them that we're proud of what we do and they don't have to agree with us politically when they grow up they have to agree with us now by the way life is just fed it tore\n[laughter] that would ever believe they want that we talk about the need\nIn a democracy to stand up for yourself and to speak your mind and I think for especially young women that's really important lesson\nWell it's important that they know they have that arrow in their quiver and also that it's not the first era you pull out every time you know and I think ... showed us that he waited until he had to go there\nAnd then he fought back I thought that was a very powerful time and I thought today how did it with Susan Collins match slap I Can't thank you for taking time out of what should be a celebratory dinner night for you and your wife\nAnd I appreciate you for being a friend not only mine but of this show and the the conservatism everywhere\nThanks Mike you're a good man and I have to say that God Bless America I think we have a great future before us\nFrom your lips God keep us go in the right way thank you bat [laughter] we'll see you soon their egos match lap or if you've never been to sea pac\nWhich happens every year in the spring it's\nEven in a non presidential election year it is worth the trip if you're anywhere near DC and if you have a young person who's looking at politics and interested in politics especially from a conservative point of view it's really important that you get them involved because their training\nAnd a good information there was well All right I'm rambling on when we get\nBack let's talk more about today I'll give you more Susan Collins will look into Chicago when what

George or a hundred percent correct\nAnd part of this starts not just a with what we talk about between ourselves\nBut Dana Perino who I just think is one of the greatest people ever in media Dana and she's fair to Dana tweeted out today that ... we just don't understand our history and I contend that because we don't teach it\nWe don't teach American history we don't teach the constitution we just finished what was it three weeks ago with constitution week\nAnd I guarantee the school's took the money to hand out the pocket constitutions but nobody had a real discussion\nOf the constitution no and uh I'm lax myself so that's why I carry one all the time\nAnd I think that if you get judges\nOn the Supreme Court who will follow this operating manual that's been handed to them and not rewrite the laws are reinterpret the laws are I I think we're going to be in a better place and I also think this this whole success of today\nIs only part of what Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been able to do with the appointment of more judges that are getting confirmed that a record rate and I think what's happened\nThere not just mad at cabinet all I think the Democrats woke up in the middle of this confirmation and what\nDo you have any idea how many judges Donald Trump is getting appointed we are screwed for decades and that's actually I think part of the anger so the\n... the judicial was always designed to be the weakest of the three branches it was just designed as a referee on the court\nI well I'm In the basketball court right there but there were there were designed to be the referee here's what it says if you have a disagreement about what it says we will re read it for you and tell you what the laws say they weren't they weren't there\nAnd only a few cold this toll free

enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf the formula is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body and still has to be converted into vitamins the three vitamin D three is the activated form so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula\nI think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients plus

be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melt vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short developments and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men the men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and\nVitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ... people in their forties [laughter] that's the way you know you start seeing more of those aches and pains like

C. S. J. lo and I argue radios\nOf owner you know and we are higher ...\nPusher on the bed laid on top of her ... her clothes off put his hand over her mouth and she she got away and then and then left she says it got to be more judge was in the room was playing the music loudly and wanting interference for Kavanaugh mark judge says wasn't very no idea what she's talking about\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl that I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the quite\nWell Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of this panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving bear left and right middle everybody's ... credible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nSurely does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple due to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has\nCorroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was so as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope so\nIt helps you need some help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that's a appointed delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have legacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and didn't report that correctly\nThe second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that at a party there were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or is it was ... ... they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk she's going to remember anything and then uh she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it in near her\nFace now she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacting her\nShe spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it\nI don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it\nTo which Kavanaugh said no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity\nIs Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where they were the trains are boys are taking a gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said which bike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quite moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she wants ten of them and activity to she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties for the another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable that ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the stories you originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times in history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay he that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because you know it causes all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that\nHe's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he made that\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these women has said\nOr the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resists lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's given\nAnd of course the Ford only vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days\nInterviewing many more people came to ... didn't come to conclusions offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\nTheir ducks and people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots better still just completely disconnected from the rest of us middle is a mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting they're still exempting these days are rapist serial rapist Jennifer rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting this way they are trying their best to change\nThe best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to being Saudi Arabia or something or China\nCome on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do the show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now what what\nCome home and so I Need your thoughts on this I I'm guaranteeing that you would have never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee ever in your life I guarantee that is true\nBut let's break it down and where are you on this even if you're on the left even a politically you're a Democrat or a liberal and somebody who generally speaking doesn't agree with me or doesn't agree with Trump\nYou have to be sickened by what what the less done here right\nLet's talk about it it's a

I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of this can be I Will clear this room would be given interrupting then it would ... would proper protocol is when they were breaking it on purpose\nJust they really thought through putting on a show which somehow window for them he turned out it made

of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of classes that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill but\n... he he he's just a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty we have to cross in this country

was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we let off allegations like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing to compare that with Kavanaugh\nRight if we let women like to come forward and do this kind of damage to manage reputation it's actually going to set back women testifying like decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBecause women have notoriously done at when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want this ... that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho is surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they're becoming more socialist I\nHave a friend that that would actually grew up in Argentina and came here and became a citizen and she is a hard core Republican and and try to explain to people whether it's truly like to live in a socialist country we don't want to go that way that I just find it so

suggested to you and your and your siblings I'm probably going to really do this you're initial reaction was well of course you should do it or no way did\nNot listen I I wanted him to do it I you know he had been so Bogle he'd been so you know tough on at ... and it was time you know you you see the nonsense that is going on you say that the ... the reality is that there's no one that could have accomplished what he's been able to do that no one that you know there's so few that ever signed the front of a paycheck\nSo few that had ever you know in our whole political system that had ever had their someone's family some of the livelihood their safety and wellbeing of their kids and grandkids dependent on their success he'd actually done it I mean\nWas the big laugh I had last week when you know Obama's running around claiming ... you know\nI remember when Obama say hey you didn't build that it's like\nNow now now he owns it right because his policies of oppressive taxation insane regulation general hatred of towards business we went oh you didn't do that I mean Obama himself when my father is like I don't know why we couldn't have three\nThree and a half four percent even even better right GDP Growth Obama goes and I quote there is no magic wand for that right now we have to New York times back them up no no no because you know of course he can do no wrong\nNo no this is the new normal well Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you haven't done anything\nIt turns out you know you're ... you're never\nDone anything he never had any experience there was no way and we should expect him to be able to fix anything economically guess what my father has done that he has built businesses yeah he did bill that\nInstill it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrats won a reversal of that they want to take everything into one eighty why\nBecause we have all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment for Hispanics for women you you want to reverse all that I mean if the Democrats the don't ask Donald Trump came out today in favor of oxygen\nDemocrats would be against it I mean that's their policies just hate\nBut we have to show up we have to stay on the fight because people's they've done I Love what you're doing it so great it's amazing it's\nYou know but I say well how we vote for who your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean it was November right they're not even a way they want to vote and twenty twenty but they don't realize that it can all go away in twenty Eighteen they don't realize that Donald Trump is on the ticket in twenty Eighteen Donald Trump is on the ticket in six weeks\nSo we got to get out we got to mobilize if you like what's going on and make sure the fight for it because the other side I don't know what they're motivated by it I don't even know what their platform there's other than right you'll have an outrage I mean you know what they are outraged and then they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but they are outraged about something else\nBut they are turning up we got to turn up I said all the time they're like no no no the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win and saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you gotta get out you got to stay and we can't just be fat happy\nAnd lazy and expect that stuff to continue he needs he needs guys like Ted Cruz do any of the guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping them he can't do it by himself and I didn't giving the house Nancy Pelosi\nSeries like serious question I think about it I mean that would be a disaster for this country that we got to turn around and we got to bring our friend\nIt's trending on average today to Nancy Pelosi is saying I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and uh we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time because it was\nCommon sense and experience right you know this isn't a magic wand

just draw red line in Syria like Obama did when they crossed that they slap you in the face where they they tried doing that at least fifty seven Tomahawk missiles and ... and guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals got NAFTA camping renegotiate it can be done\nAnd congratulations Mexico and Canada

always ask that Kavanaugh had last week from a wake up on the sunrise had in the mountain right\nI'm sure take great time to be alive and pregnant entering a fantastic job and keeping us peaceful and prosperous sounding you can you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think it's by the mainstream media where he used to come in and they've never seen a positive data point that they had ignored enough and I guess\nBut they'll start 'em ever covering this economy Joe if God Forbid it ever starts to go down but even all the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among\nAfrican Americans in Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans in women teenagers and veterans and\nAnd the growth rate is up but even today got\nVery little coverage anywhere but there was an estimate of one hundred and eighty five thousand new private sector jobs created for the last month and it said it was two hundred and thirty thousand so the wages are up the job availability is up people feel mobile they can move around and find a better job closer to home maybe with better health care and retirement benefits\nAnd that's what freedom looks like the deregulation agenda that the twenty eight or so judges on the United states circuit courts and of course justice Gorsuch in\nAnd perhaps soon followed by justice capital\nIt's Kellyanne Conway drills or to the president or do\nYou know and by the ... the woman that the president says really the reason why you want to win the election I agree with that when we talk about cabinet they couldn't make anything that to be brought him early on as you said\nThey couldn't get him on the marriage now let's go back and find out who he you know it might have a total was\nBack when he was fourteen now the guys who abuse device allegedly somebody at a

whether\nWhether or not they're also not going to those who have said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominate joy Supreme Court are certainly not going to\nFind their way to supporting judge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this is this is about destroyed destroying a man's life because he's he\nWas nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open in passing the terms of not three twenty twenty and America has had it\nAmericans are smart and they're watching this process people are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford has Dianne Feinstein a Democrat due to blame that she is now a household name recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it\nAnd after the twelfth our hadn't told and but for the Republicans bloody Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTestify under oath it's the Senate Judiciary committee and the majority of the other Republicans I gave her that um but you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the processed foods folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting ... on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll see what happens\nBut if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats your bags you're really nervous today because you're caught between a on one hand you were Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism\nAnd toward destruction and resistance an obstruction and delay and and and stop sign as a symbol of your party and you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right because\nWest Virginians and and and who's yours in Indiana and certainly people in North Dakota knows where they want judge Kavanaugh confirmed and they want their senators to do their jobs advising can vending in voting for him\nIt's just really really going on wait till you do you think that there should be ethics committee investigation into Feinstein or whoever on her staff leak that out you settle news for two months she could have talked to tunnel data directly when they met probably\nYou could have bought into the president's shoes you got the letter you're right she sat on her because she hoped to do with being them down on the merits they couldn't the values supremely qualified to be most jobs are going to be an investigation should there be [noise]\nWell I saw some members say that they were going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week uh say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the\nOf the letter and uh the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the odd consequences that could follow to Ford's lawyers who either\nNeglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to Ford that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California\nWell that ever happened to come to Washington either for lied

I think he came away because she's not even licensed so radicalized and there's going to go for ... you\nWrite that was one of her many lies that I Hope the FBI is is focusing on\nWhat people in line and she doesn't like the while you're listening to a tropical island somewhere where she'd go snorkeling\nAnd the\nDanger is no that is one of the most hilarious\nI'm I mean I ... I'm Still you know in a blind rage here right um this is about how\nNo she's afraid of flying it's first of all that's part of the Trump allegedly right she's suffering she can't stand to be an enclosed space right number two it was used to put off her testimony Brett Kavanaugh's be accused of rape assault\nUm indecent exposure wild drunkenness center right parties and you have to just sit and take it without being able to testify for a week right didn't lay on the ground that Dr Ford because of her trauma was afraid to fly well that just went out the window so that's a pretty big why\nDo you ever given him a committee wouldn't go to her over the church where they would so the whole thing was is just a sham she doesn't know when it happened what year it happened how many people were there were the house was what the neighborhood was who\nDied regarding which at her home sided than\nI have all refuted it they didn't know he did not have been refuted what'd you say you're in colder no more Mr White guy I'm gonna I'm going to post a link to this too that maybe the her latest book is resistance is futile how the Trump hitting left last has lost its collective mind\nAnd we are we seeing that with cattle and\nReally are in and I got to tell you I don't know\nI'm I'm kind of dumb in a mostly white although my skin is much more Italian all of a book [laughter] I'm a white guy and I'm watching it in Ford is white and blue sweat Nick is white\nAnd there are white men on the left that we're asking questions and they were really mad at Blumenthal good lawyers face off he was really mad I'm all these people everybody involved with the story's what except for Deborah\n... and we can argue about whether Hispanics you're white or black or would the races but this is not this has never been about race he'd wanted to go there\nUm it's but this has has been a cliche for some time I'm I've been noticing this Hillary you probably don't remember this but in one of her slams of Trump during the campaign she said something to the fact of um he has an odd funds for white autocrats\nI Do remember that no I yeah so okay\nCast your mind once again we're going to think about actual fact here in your mind over the world and think of where there are dictators autocrats or something like that it may have been\nWhite authoritarian rulers well I I think I'd start with the entire continent of Africa I wouldn't\nMove my way up to the middle east we would get lots of autocrats authoritarian rulers in in in the far east um\nI guess she's talking about who and who was the only white autocrats I can think of he's not exactly start one\nHe's even Khrushchev right but she throws\nAnd that's one thing people like me started to notice oh my gosh white is just it's the way Hannity uses the word literally it's an intense a fire and has no actual meaning other than um\nIt's really bad why\nIt's so bad because of his white noose in colder no more Mr White guy ... you cite a bunch of these quotes from from the idiots on the left or media you've got to be understanding they have all these white men will be questioning Islam and the next one is women across the nation should be outraged that white men senators are doing this to a woman there's been\nSome discussion but you'll be centers you happened to be all white men I mean I\nI don't I don't understand that there's so much anger against white men and so much guilty even white men themselves that this crap works in\nUh it hasn't worked on may\nNor me and I go out as I Am I'm Still a white dude\nIt's um it's very strange and I also take issue I mean I at least understand the logic of saying it should be women women understand massage any and that shouldn't be a panel of women questioning and alleged sexual assault um accuser\nUm but the last time um that I can remember where I'm somebody one big for don't worry women understand massage any and end violence against women wasn't when they pick the OJ jury\nRight or a member that was Marsha Clark big idea\nBlack white I don't care as long as they're women they will bond with with um what's her name I'm Nick Nicole Brown Simpson right on didn't work out for oh no oh\nI guess the jury didn't see the point so I think it's idiotic to say that only women should be\nShould be questioning that actually don't you have all these rape laws as Janine bureau said right\nBless her soul she said you know for years I've been prosecuting sex crimes cases and I was prosecuting them under laws written by white men I mean at the top feel when he wrote about America he wrote about how the ... the crime of rape\nIn income ... even ... you know other European countries which was what he was familiar with is that the crime rate is so much more serious in America than anyplace else it is just barely seconds to murder this is what the respect for women in this new country is a lot of\n'em and it has always been through what American women don't know what they're asking for if they want to throw over the the white male patriarchy because the white male patriarchy has been pretty terrific for women\nKnow it really has been a June culture but even the book is resistance as you do have it from hitting left last is collective mind she's written this article no more Mr White guy you're just back to the OJ trial for a second you have to give the the the jurors a pass and you see the blood evidence always showed that ... that the troops that are being him or seven billion to one\nSo there's a change in was it him go through on\nThe\nBottom line is and I'm going to ask you about this before we run out of time I did ask you about Jeff Flake look if you're in charge of this committee why is he still there when he says I'm not running for reelection when he says that I'm Out of your what do you make so much noise about how Trump is horrible and the director of the country is bad why is that guy that we still want to be a limit on the Judiciary Committee have any clue\nThat's a really great point Republicans do not think seeing these things out strategically Republicans are used to being over just going to you know the gentleman we're not going to lose 'em strategize um and and and look I Love 'em this week but don't get too high on Lindsey Graham run\nHe's the sort of Republican and takes the position well if I keep voting for Democrat nominees just even though I Know they're going to be total disasters on the court maybe maybe Democrats will reward my good\nThey never happened never made it looks to me you know you got to start thinking about this and advance guys\nRuth Bader Ginsburg Ninety six to three she was confirmed\nThink about that how radically left you use and you write these people like Lindsey Graham and in the late John McCain's vote that they were going to\nGet paid back the pay back to screw you were not going to allow you to do it and it happens every single time it's colder get the book resistance as you do have a drop hitting left lost its collective mind last question does he get confirmed or not there's no doubt about him being a rapist any more about him being an angry drunks\nAnd ...\nExactly right and he's drawing in the ...\nBureau holiday would go with anything that is so obvious that this is unfair I mean I Can't think about anything else I I I'm outside I get splashed with a puzzle and I think I was going to affect cabinet\nI wake up and that must be how um you know Hillary\nSupporters felt the day off and you write our side is not going to let Republicans given this time I tend to say yes um I think he will be confirmed and I would like to add ... yeah um I think he should invite Julie sweat next to his swearing in ceremony in on the ground without her this might not have been possible\nListening when NBC News has to admit that there are inaccurate Caesar differences and her two stories you know it's wildly just made up has to be right\nYes how ... how many ex boyfriend that she threatened to kill and and kill their unborn children how many lawsuits against her for false allegations of sexual misconduct and our own sexual misconduct\nAnd you ... you must believe the victim slash survivor which matter what you want to meet with him so\nI Want her on TV twenty four hours a day\nSpirits in golden we always appreciate the time and the access she's awesome and are in very very very spot on here when it comes to a cabin on this debacle\nAgain keep in mind those would be listening to the show after noon or at at night on Saturday or on Sunday the confirmation voters already happened for you as we do show live but has not happened yet it is supposed to happen\nAnd the next hour or so one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty

I'm just going to try to state as many facts as I can uh whereas many obvious observations as I can despite the fact that this is\nYou just people are losing their minds about the politics on this I mean they're they're show vicious and nasty and\nA desirous of\nAttacking one another as human beings and his people and and doing so with the most vitriolic terms they can think of\nA this is obviously a political discussion as well it's going to be weakened video I consider in jail you look later on the show up and up Joe Jones joined us these ... D walk us through everything we\nKnow about these bombs I had a little bit of bumped reading myself back in the day and the CIA so you know ... and ... also dealing with kind of terrorism investigations which often involve a bombs in IDs\nSo walk through that component of it but but the overwhelming focus of the media\nAlready are going to be about assigning blame and ah and settling scores here quite honestly and and making sure that there is a maximum political impact\nHow do you just heard that statement from President Trump he says there's no place for political violence in this country\nAnd Jeff Zucker over CNN which CNN's one of the places where they had this suspicious package and they did all their coverage today from outside of CNN and\nAh you know ... Jeff Zucker released this official statement from CNN the president of CNN released this ... ... ... you know President Trump had already said what are the audio that I played for you of\nYou know there's no place for for political violence in American society none or threats no that's the president says\nHere's how the president of CNN responds\nQuote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter though so far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThis isn't just disgusting low blow from the president of CNN that's what this is this is it's the president's fault that some lunatic this is the president of CNN saying it's it's the president's fault the president's\nWords that are tied to this in some way right away without even knowing without even knowing who this is what the real motivation is\nThis is the this is a disgrace and\nThere's no shortage of this rhetoric coming from people now they they view this as a means\nOf getting even with Trump now you know and they also view this as wiping away what had become a very powerful narrative because it was so true that the left is a bunch of screaming mob ing maniacs\nNow they're going to say oh it's both sides now now the the the entirety of the Democrat power apparatus and all of its all of its media wings which CNN is certainly one of them are going to claim victims status over this\nAll the way up until election day before we even know who did it before we know anything about what they've done\nAnd you know I I'm Sorry but I Do not remember I Do not remember the head of Fox News or the head of you know it and forget about the head of it and they do not remember ah the the biggest names in the business that I Am in\nRush Limbaugh Sean Hannity or you know Glenn Beck I I Do not remember any of them saying oh it's it's the fault of CNN for example it's the fault of CNN that a Bernie Sanders supporting lunatic\nActually shot Steve ... and he almost died and tried to shoot a whole bunch of conservative members of Congress\nBecause of their insane rhetoric because of their\nThey've been calling the president of the United states oh trader or Russian huge a crazy person a rapist or racist white nationalist effectively a clan member\nAnd they said he's destroying the country he's undermining our institutions someone must take action someone must do something about this\n\nAnd here we are here we are\nAt a point where finally there's a moment where the Democrat power structure feels like they are under threat and I I Am the ... I you know I Am consistent on this you do not hurt people hit people attacked people or worse because you don't like their ideas you don't do it\nNobody should do it knowing justified and doing it it's disgusting\nIt's illegal it's immoral and it's if you really are a true believer in some ideology at least in America right now it's truly counterproductive because right now\nIf you\nTake those kinds of actions your entire side but I'd have to bear the consequences so to speak so it's it's wrong and and an evil in stupid on every level\nBut if the Democrats who have been trying to blur the lines for the last six months or so and it's the Democrats who have been saying all those things about President Trump since he became president\nAnd as I've been telling you if you really believe that we are descending into fascism as a mainstream left wing writers will have been saying if you really believe that friends the United states is a threat of starting an unnecessary nuclear war if you believe those things\nThen taking extreme measures does not seem like such a leap does it\nThey have not been pushing back on Trump for tax reasons they have not been pushing back on Trump's for you know health care with any of the same\nVigor and seriousness and ferocity as they have on all these fantasy that they have conjured around Russia collusion and twenty Fifth Amendment of Trump is crazy and he's going to start a war\nAnd now\nAnd now they want to pretend that oh it's it's Trump's fault that this happened and this is right from the very top this is right from the top of the Democrat left wing power structure in the media Jeff Zucker himself\n\nGeoff my assistant is going to be overheard by a friend of mine declaring that CNN has declared war on Trump that's right that happened Jeff Zucker\nNow I can sit here and say without any feelings of of ah she position is\nThat my criticisms of CNN all stent\nCNN is a dishonest news organization that is pushing an agenda that is furthering division in this country that lives about the president addresses it up as news coverage and that has a lot of coddled babies like Acosta an others\nWho refused to accept that you know if you want to be taken all kinds of shots at the Republicans and the president maybe they're actually go to criticize you back with words with words there are allowed to do that\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I Can't also sit here and say I I'm happy to hear that no one is CNN was hurt\nThat I have friends including some very dear friends who still work at CNN and even if I hated everybody CNN which I don't I Would still pray for every single one of them to be fine and come out of work on skates and go home to their families and I do feel that way and I know you feel that way too\nBut there's something deeply wrong there's something unseemly and unethical about immediately trying to make it or will you can still criticize us and hope that we're okay you can't condemn these\nBombs being sent to us but also continue to criticize us no I I I can and will and it's not just seeing that it's all these other ... you know it's it's George Soros is doing the funds incredibly destructive\nIncredibly destructive programs for freedom in for liberty and at America I mean he he is behind a lot of very bad stuff\nUm and then when you add it you know then you add into this also obviously the the Obamas in the Clinton the people who are ideological opponents\nDoesn't mean that I hate them I don't\nRespect the Clintons but I mean I you know I disagree strenuously with the Obamas I don't really respect the Clintons but that's a different thing I'm allowed to not respect and that doesn't mean that I Would ever advocated violence against any political figure anyone for their beliefs for that matter\nBut not not even a day passes not even a day passes\nFor us to deal with this issue to figure out who's behind this to figure out what's going on or without it\nUse right away in the most obvious bashing disc or political points but I was going to say the Democrats think this is the way they can actually ensure they win the house and maybe stopping a red wave in the Senate that's what they think this is that's what they're using is that\nYeah the rice and attacked the media barely even better than I Do need or someone sending rice into like Madison the White House or the Pentagon\nNo that was a story for about an hour don't pay any attention to that so\nWe ... what what are they really saying you're out of the whole ... thing there what do you know I must say we're not blaming anybody interest all the right wing people criticized these people and that's the only thing we know about them so excluded the right wing sprawl that's that's what you're really to take away from that playing this game of ... we're not jumping to conclusions but he was a conclusion\nThat's what the left is up to hear a this is inherently a very political issue and I I Know\nThat this is a serious issue and nobody should be you know should be it with bottles and no one has been injured yet either so let's also let's let let's not let's not back resolves into we can't even talk about this on my gosh you know the ... there's a you know the bodies haven't even been very you know once you've been harmed yet\nSo we should feel free to talk about this issue without feeling like we're being disrespectful to the families of the you know we want everyone to be safe we want everyone to be okay but this is in the heat of a political campaign to so yeah this is an issue we are going to talk about\nThis left is already trying to shape this whole thing though to their advantage is just so\nThey don't want anyone else to do any of that so no one else can be political\nDemocrats [noise]\nBecause they are victims of of course\nThe news radio I'm Brian shook us suspicious item address the California congresswoman Maxine Waters is being investigated in LA

Trump\nThe president and his allies the need to dial down the political rhetoric and they are making people let's say they are making journalist ... they and they are making law enforcement officer is let's say\nLet's remember we have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who has encouraged violence against the media\nIs an obvious threat the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN um George Soros these are people and organizations that President from continually attacking will demonize us\nDo I believe the heated rhetoric

media and there's no\nI actually saw someone said today or I forget that the journals another blue check you know Twitter journal person\nOr say that the Trump statement where he said there's no place for political violence in this country or threats in this country that that was the bare minimum that he said the bare minimum I'm like well does he have to give us an hour long speech Amish or what what they're going to criticize a matter of what he does\nWhether it's could show gay or this or anything they just they hate him they absolutely hate him\nYou know earlier today actually there were just talking about the president's it's such a liar oh he's such a liar so terrible noticed you know my objection to Obama that I thought he had bad ideas he wasn't nearly as related to the media pretend that he was and he was arrogant and he was doing bad things from policy level\nActually don't have any personal beef with Obama like I didn't I didn't know it wasn't about Obama the guy seems like he's a very nice family seems like he's a good dad I mean there there's a lot of stuff actually I'm going to bomb us or you know that's that seems admirable\nBut I thought he was a bad president and I disagree with them I didn't hate him though I didn't go to bed and I think all that that that's come Obama wasn't some maniac\nBut that's how they feel about Trump and now because some maniac\nSomewhere we don't even know why yet but somebody somewhere sent these bombs now we're supposed to believe what Trump is supposed to be muzzle me here's what they were saying about him earlier in the day it's liquid for\nHow sorry the president flat out lie saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election he gets caught the lie he changes his story again and says we're\nGoing to get sort of actually the president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid clear officially and parents and in fact France how\nPresident Trump tries to play to his base with outright false\nHe's not even trying to hide his life anymore he's putting all out there in spreading a lot of lines about non white people to fall white crowd to make a sound a lot of what the president saying it's just\nNot true that seems to me in a bit of the fat free frenzy frustration and health oxygen ...\n\nThis is a an an article of faith now do you have to say this all the time\nWhen ever asked them what what's the lie what they're really damaging pernicious live what is the lie on the level of if you like your health care plan you can keep it that President Trump has told one that was done with forethought with malice and that had impact on the lives of tens of millions of Americans\nNegative impact what what is the law that lines up with that but that is crowd size was the biggest ever that he's a stable genius you know a lot of the stuff that he says you and I can recognize as him kind of joking around and talking as normal people do\nKnow he's a liar oh he's lying you know they're they're always always jump right to the worst possible scenario\nThey never get tired of it either oh my gosh\nYou know in the left in the media they they find endless ways\nTo reach a Lebanon the outrage meter ten is not enough eleven the outrage me in regards his brother I Know I I just get frustrated with that too it's it's so tiresome\nAnd they're all their calls for civility or they're being made in bad faith they're not calls for civility they're not really from a lot of these a prominent leftists their calls for the right to be silent and to start getting pummeled again they like the old order\nWe sit around and were polite and we can we as conservatives play by the rules and were nice and we get punched in the face and say oh that was nice but I'm going to keep doing what I Do that\nThat's what they want us to go back to crumble and play that game they're not saying let's all be good to each other day defend the mobs in the restaurants we'll talk more about that later they defend these tactics then it's not just that they happened and they say oh well we can't control every one they're favorable to this stuff\nAnd now they're saying we all have to be civil and take the temperature down\nAfter Eighteen months of propaganda I think to their base the president's at trader a sexist a rapist or a you know a racist a everything crazy going to start a war is a fascist they stopped they said about President Trump but it's like nothing I've ever seen in my life\nIt is like nothing I've ever it truly is that there's nothing that even comes close\nNow they're going to be the civility please come on\nWho takes this seriously these people are these people are really in need of reality check 'em\nReally and he got Joe Scarborough Scarborough if I if I just can't for a minute here I don't know Joe Scarborough never met him don't really care to a\nBut this was a guy who was his chummy chummy buddy buddy with the president as you could possibly be during the ... what it really mattered as a journal to be an objective for and scarred wasn't opinion guy but you know he's a member of the media and he had an opportunity to speak truth to power and all that but no he wanted to because you with power he wanted to be close to power\nAnd now because Trump has not him in Mika\nA\nNow because Trump is something that's not the two of them he he goes on these anti Trump rage rants\nAnd first doing today is on Christ like I mean this is oh here's what's ... six\nHistory will look back and Americans will look back with shame that we ever had a president like this one\nA vet turned his back on the most basic not only the most basic American concepts of what we defend our borders and and we should defend our borders people should only getting a here legally\nWhat Donald Trump's doing is\nNot only anti American\nI Will just say this is a guy that was raised in Southern Baptist church\nAt least based on\nThe Bible I read the gospels that I read the good Samaritan story that I read in some Christ like\nYeah that's right Joe Scarborough is going back to is oh so Christian roots and a\nSide in the Bible to criticized Trump I mean this guy has no shape no shame\nWhatsoever I mean he goes over at MSNBC and\n... that show up for sale in the morning I hear so much blather and so much nonsense and as long as anti Trump you know the audiences\nYou it's good to like the the works really really is an embarrassment but you know people people believe what they want to believe unfortunately this world my friends and you know I'm here in the swamp of what you find out more\nAnd more is that so many of these folks that that thinks that they're standing proud for the truth in the media they're really just it's all about their own their own brand their own paycheck in their own access all the time\nThey don't know what they do if they were doing this job and they just want to get his co you to power responsible and they're not in the Trump orbit they want to be as far away from it as they can so they can be in the anti Trump orbit\nAnd there's very few people that you can try to strike any kind of neutral balance anymore I mean this is just this is a media war\nThat's the plan I I'd rather not I'd rather not allow that to uh to happen not not on my watch if I could afford it away or\nRussia collusion fall out of the headlines tomorrow but I have George Papadopoulos on rising with me so if you want to see that very interesting interview uh but I wanted to do something because you know this guy's got some prison time\nAnd for what a has a felony on his record now and the whole thing is such a joke around him but here's a congressman ice it talking about this play eight\nWe're going into an election in which real wrong doing two years ago\nIs still not properly investigated well a special investigator Mohler is continuing to indict people for unrelated crime as an active though there's collusion when he hasn't had one piece of it then he's been able to demonstrate\nSo the the voters are going in with some very interesting misinformation or lack of information and two years is a long time it's too long and we should have deposed him today yup\nI completely agree with ice in one part of this whole election that we don't talk about enough\nIs how it is tainted by there's a deep state action against the president not just the effort to create this false Russia collusion narrative but also the Mueller probe which Grimes along and with these trumped up oh conspiracy against the United states charges that stuff is crazy\nIt's nonsense and\nThat affects voting that affects people's minds about this president and really profound ways so you know the the left is already stacked the deck there already cheating\nInnocence already playing dirty and\nWho knows how much dirtier I told you you guys members I started a couple of weeks ago I think we've got another October surprise you know I said it on this show we got something else it's going to hit us and I can't tell you exactly what's going on today but I can tell you that\nWell

Jones now he is a a former marine and he was an EEO detect so he was all about explosive ordnance disposal\nJohnny Was was wounded in combat and his role as an EEO detect and that he knows everything about these devices how they're built how you tracked them and what they can do a job at great to have you on that thank you so much\nYeah thanks for having me on today\nAll right so from what we know right now let's just go to the what what can we what can we say about\nThese devices bunch pipe bombs any signatures any sophistication or lack there of what's notable to you about these bombs\nWell you know I can only go off really the the information ... giving and and the one picture that's out there so I Want to put that out front say it's purely speculative are just going to what we see what we hear um it so what we saw it looks like a pipe bomb\nAnd it had some sort of timing device on the outside of it was doing it for both\nAnd the idea there is this is a functional bomb what you would have the bonded either once that time or hit a certain time and a pre determined time in its past life it would\nTurn on a lie or sell the noise and so what you do you take that same signal that same electrical signals you re route that into a circuit that detonate the bombs so that\nOne normally the light would come on the bond that ... normally the bell wondering when an alarm clock the bond that nature of the other way it could have been used would be to arm it so if a switches of breaking a circuit than an arming a and arming mechanism is another breaking the circuits so circuits still open\nBut once the arming gets closed and the next thing that closes the switch full set it off so we know and and the use of timing devices\nThey're used for one or two things either to predict turban when the bomb goes off or to keep yourself as the bomb maker time to get away from it before it's armed and so if this bond is a functional device which I have my own doubts that are suspicious about what I could see in that picture\nBut if it's a if it's a functional device and we certainly have to treat it that way then we would call this a time device or out of their time to arm or trying to debt day\nAnd being that it was in a field package and there seems to be no other true mechanism of of the nation than we kind of have to believe from what we can see from that picture that it's a time to detonate device meaning they said\nYou know a certain amount of hours on that timer and when it runs up it was their radically detonate\nNow that's going to be a very I mean I I Would assume Joey you I mean this is going to be a very\nUm [noise] I don't know how sloppy way to try to target an individual right any assuming this was actually sent through the mail to just have a timing device on it and you have to be guessing\nWhen it would be you know it sounds like it's more likely could blow up still a risk to people could really could kill somebody who could blow up in the mail processing center and the mailman hand perhaps or eight on any number of phase is not including the targeted individual\nWell you know it it it becomes one of those talking points where I really need to think through how much information and hauling to divulge than in detail to any audience because you just never know who's listening and there are certain things that you know our best are best kept secrets keep us alive or not go into too much detail\nAbout how boundary made about Ninety percent of what you put into a bomb as readily available at Walmart and the information is on the Internet there's one or two components really one specific part of the bomb that is really hard to make yourself and it's even harder to get a hold of manufactured\nAnd uh and so what we have right now is if this is a fleet of vi speeches meaning that it\nCould function as as as it appears to\nThen uh then that components within the pie and if they can exploit or or take apart what is there to recover some of those pieces then perhaps there some signatures so specific parts of the pieces they can\nMore easily point it's in the right direction when I Would say or were you really I'm just like an Austin or the shipping of the package if you know the one that we're looking at now seems to be the hand delivered by courier but there's questions about the postage him was that actually put through a a delivery service or\nThat someone just hand is talking to someone outside and say hey I'll give you twenty dollars a ticket and that's the only thing we don't know and those those leads those human lead\nThe tracking the shipment that's the first place will go in the meantime someone probably over at Quantico with the FBI will utilize some tools and techniques we have this safely disassembled this bomb\nAnd uh and if there are specific components that are serialized or manufactured at a very low rate from one manufacturer then that's going to give us a lot of information right there and\nCinder down there you've done a demonstration project it works put it to use ...

just last week talking about the assault on a reporter by a congressman in Montana and saying that the heat that he's he's kind of guy\nIt's hard to see this outside of the context of the president's

obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ruse but it's an obvious to read the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN\nUm George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump continually

Democrats and others today one was founded dressed actor Robert Deniro package\nBureaucratic nightmare of an investigation going on merely to target their political enemies that's the whole purpose of it\nThey now have mobs in the streets mobs on the Supreme Court steps mobs on Capitol Hill me in the halls of Congress\nThey pretend that they're not mobs\nAnd then when there was finally the first time that they think they have an opening to whack a finger at the other side over incivility which remember it wouldn't be the instability of a mob it wouldn't be the instability of an entire movement it would just be\nMaybe one wacko who is sending what increasingly looks like yard bombs to very very prominent Democrats and leftists\nAnd they want to lecture all of us and they claim that they're not doing which just goes\nTo show you how much gas lighting goes on in our conversations with the left I I Will give you examples of as we will spend a bit of our time this hour working through just how dishonest the left is being with all this\nJust how delusional they really are\nBut I didn't want to spend a moment you first on what we what we now know about uh about these bombs in fact I could have and it's just hear from the attorney general my buddy\nJeff Sessions like with a please\n... apartment is responding to the suspicious packages that have been sent to several political leaders and a media outlet and then ask last few days yesterday I spoke with FBI Director for his Ryan\nAnd deputy director they vow outage and we met with in brief the president to bring

make sure that we get to the bottom of an injustice was done\nThey will find who is responsible for this I'm very confident of that I don't know how quickly though and I don't know if it will be in time for us to make a\nFully informed decision us being the American people you and I already know this doesn't if it doesn't affect my vote doesn't affect my feeling about Trump or the Republican Party or anything else this has nothing to do with\nSafety threat this is one very very stupid and ah and agree just an evil jerk I wanted to use another word but we're on radio um who is going to spend the rest of his life in prison\nIt's just a question of how soon we put him through that process but the dirty bombs that have been found so far no could they have gone off could they have detonated under any circumstances\nThere was a press conference today with the NYPD in fact one of my uh some of my former colleagues were named in the press conference I had a bit of nostalgia\nBut they talked about how the bombs that haven't gone off it kept getting asked the question by the press are they real bombs or the ... the M y pd is going to have to say you have to treat these as real threats because just imagine for a moment that the largest police department the country's as no these are these are\nThe odds and then the next suspicious packages that goes out whether it's by the same person or not but look similar person opens it up and goes well I Know what to do it and\nThen we have a tragedy someone loses limbs site maybe dogs from one of these pipe bombs or the NYPD can't take that risk not yet can't say that these bombs wouldn't have gone off under any circumstances but I'm here to tell you that I think\nThat is increasingly likely to be the case\nAnd if that is in fact what's going on here let's just take a step back I Know I'm not supposed to say I know I'm not supposed to go there but then again I actually\nProfessionally did this on like Ninety percent of the clowns going on MSNBC and CNN to talk about it and in the past when they've tried to tell me if those places what is and it's not real when it comes to terrorism or they have\nTended to get bucks slapped rather hard here's what I see if you were trying to come up with a means to change the entire national conversation away from Kavanaugh which\nWas toxic for Democrats in red states and Democrats in states where Democrats were struggling the Kavanaugh debacle self inflicted wound was toxic\nAnd the caravan making its way up through Mexico the far left active is when the Democratic party loves this story um but the people and places like Indiana and Tennessee and Nevada who are figuring out who to vote for gas what they don't much like the idea that the Democrat Party\nIs effectively an open borders party\nPrivileges certain people from certain places of the world getting around the rest of the immigration system because it benefits the Democrats electro prospects they don't like that and so if you wanted to switch that narrative if that was the purpose it has been master fully achieved here\nNow is in fact possible\nSome would even say probable I'm I'm not quite there yet I Need I Need more evidence is it possible problem this is one\nIncredibly stupid reckless and a ... and really her doing whatever side he thinks he's on doing tremendous damage to it is it possible that this is somebody who wears a mock a hat and and loves Trump so much they thought that the way to\nThe way to show support was to violate hundreds of federal statutes threaten people terrified people and in the process put himself in a sure fire\nA position to be spending the rest of his life in federal prison is that possible absolutely that's possible I'm not discounting that at all we may find out that that is the case\nHowever am I willing to discount am I willing to push aside that if this was in fact somebody whose purpose was to change the conversation right before the midterm I don't think anybody believes this is a coincidence in terms of the time and\nIf the purpose was to was to push aside conversations that were damaging to the Democrats and in the process\nMake the anti Trump media seem sympathetic and give them something to talk about that might sway some moderate to their side just in time the election would this be a successful strategy yes I Am talking about a false flag strategy\nI'm not saying happened I'm saying would these things all be true if this were a false black answers obviously yes\nSo that's why I'm unwilling to just discount this out of hand and that's why I I refuse to take the position that well because the left has already started not just to blame the right for this but to blame the president of the United states for this\nThat's where I think we have to draw a very hard and fast line the Democrats have created not alone but primarily predominantly they have created this vicious toxic political environment\nThey have never thought for one moment there was anything decent are acceptable about Trump they wanted to remove him from office I even had an author on impeachment on my on my TV show or in the week you said yes this is the first time ever that there's been impeachment talk for a president who had not even been sworn in\nThey have a mass delusion problem they're having a collective nervous breakdown in slow motion over Trump and his movement and that's\nWhy things have become so tense and so nasty and so vicious\nSo would one individual change that dynamic you know we will\nHold our final conclusions until we have more evidence but in the meantime I'm leaving open all reasonable options and some that the Democrats want to shut down or a long way from deserving that got a jam

O. J. ... three specific felonies conspiracy to defraud the United states oh barring the over broad but\nGot to show both sides live under it um favorite tool of more\nMature early false statements to federal officials and deliberate obstruction of a federal investigation\nWow Oh yes this needs to happen I think ... no fool grassy is a serious and very powerful guy in the Senate\nAnd this referral is going to be tough to ignore the department of justice is going to have to look into this\nAnd that means folks that there could be unlike the proceeding that the left was so excited to use to try and smear Kavanaugh which was not\nA standard criminal proceedings right there they could not subpoena people they could not uh take their phone records that were there no phone records to take the allegations were from thirty five years ago or whatever it was just the whole thing was insane and I'm so I'm going to say this I Am so proud of what\nWe did hear on the show me and bike and John the whole team and all of you supporting me when that was\nA really difficult a couple of weeks especially in the early days we knew it was garbage and we held the line we kept our shield sigh yes we did\nWe held the line on this one and people notice by the way\nThere was a front line on defending have it all and we here in the freedom that we were on that front lawn\nPublicly in every possible way I was in contact with the White House team I was trying to get through the confirmation on a near daily basis\nSo um\nThat Grassley is not passing this thing up and saying okay you know we'll let bygones be bygones is the right move and this could did this will mean that the D. O. J. now has the ability\nTo pull records you know they they might be able to see some communications perhaps between sweating egg and other people but you know this ... you want to play in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're going to sign\nRidiculous sworn statements with no ... nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean the whole thing\nIf they can prove she lied if they can prove ... he was part of a conspiracy for her July they must both be criminally prosecuted\nThe law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room\nFor interpretation here if they can prove it now there is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were so vague with a statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and I think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't\nBut then again she changed her testimony publicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fixed but an obvious fix that was when it was clear to anyone paying attention\nOkay this really is too much this person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's where I think we are now\nBut if they they're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't want can you imagine if Julie sweating it faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what if then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie about what that does to the narrative\nAnd I am very clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer the consequences because they're doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life is an attempted ruin nation of the human beings life that must be punished\nCrystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the uh the stripper who claimed with Mike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina\nThat Duke lacrosse team rape curves complete fabrication a total lie which you find a guy was raping her who was miles away and an ATM machine and they had him on video and using his card there so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away\nA complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did ... and he should have gone to prison for a long time but that just to support him\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend seven to death later on\nMaybe she should have actually had to deal with justice of course you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today not only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process but\nIf we really do care about truth and decency and justice in our system if we care about due process and the right to protect your reputation the right to face the acute the to face your accuser the right not to be destroyed at the political whims of the left for their convenience\nThan people who lie in order to destroy you under oath must be punished\nThe left is going to kick and scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them they know it now will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet\nIs it clear to me that sweating as a liar absolutely absolutely I as I did I Know she's a liar not just based on statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't say I think someone spiked punch at a party which what what was that even mean\nThat was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking what he's drinking the punch\nHow would you spiking the punch he's gonna he's going to poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move\nThink about that she didn't she didn't say spiking a drink spiking an entire punishable determine drink yeah maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it's none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she'd deranged I mean\nAnd that's where they're going to say if if they really nail her on the lie\nThe story will be she's not a sound mind let's let this go she suffered a novel that kind of stuff I'm Sorry I Know if she was of sound mind enough to bring these charges and try to put the final nail in Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation coffin she's of sound mind enough to have to face the consequences of our actions to have to actually stand up and defend what it was that she was saying and how she was saying it and she ... she sworn affidavit\nThat either has meaning or does it so I Hope Grassley pushes this and the DEA OJ needs to investigate this\nAnd we'll see how far they're able to be able to take it I think that this could end\nVery very poorly

way they are being told exactly what to say all they have to do was establish a record and that just means saying they don't even have to but\n\nIt's sort of switched around it used to be that Central American immigrants at the border would would ah would lie and say they were Mexican because if they were going to be detained and sent back they didn't want to get flown back to Central America because they spend a lot of time and money often do you get to the border\nAnd so they would rather just be released back into Mexico you their Central American but now that's changed because of this asylum claim situation and as long as as long as they can\nI'm\nConvinced a border patrol agent or a few border patrol agents and the uh immigrations and Customs Enforcement\nProcess that they are from Honduras um they are going to be part of this asylum deal right they're going to get brought in and letting the injured the United states and as I've been telling you that's not going to that's just there's never going to be real enforcement alright what can be done about this I'm not going to have a bucket or whatever\nThe issue the ultimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum in that needed to change the asylum process so that you apply in your in your country or in the nearest country you can get you\nOut of a U.S embassy and there's a process as it should not be that you just present yourself in this way out of port of entry\nUm because you're walking within walking distance the United states that's not that's not the way that this law should be but uh as important that there's something called a safe third party say third country agreement\nIs while I can tell you things on the show that you want to hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that his time well spent team\nSo the say third a third country agreement would mean and we have one with Canada by the way so this is not some crazy concoction and we've we've discussed\nThe possibility of this uh at the government a government level with Mexico\nBut what it would mean is that we would set up\nAt the border but on the Mexican side of the border and we yes we would probably have to pay for this and I was a book they should they should pay for it will go a lot faster and much more effective if we pay for it we would set up\nA centrally trailers you know a holding facility Sunday is not attention facility but it's a\nWhat would be somewhat similar to a a refugee camp situation or it would be a place where people you know they have uh they're they're able to stay safe there's water there's food um but it's on the Mexican side of the board\nAnd we would move infrastructure down to the border so that you have\nAt port of entry courts\nSo you would start you would move the judicial infrastructure to deal with these immigration cases right down to the border\nAnd people that were waiting for their education process so that would speed it up obviously and people that are waiting for their education process would be on the Mexican side of the U.S border\nWhich means that they don't or that they're not able to just go further and further in the interior United States and get some you know immigrant rights lawyer to represent them pro bono to keep suing the federal government all the rest of it if their claim is denied guess what\nThey they get to stay in Mexico\nOr or the Mexican government then can can hand them off to their country of origin of it that way you prevent what's happening right now which is using the legal system and it's very important we understand as they are not illegal immigrants\nThey may cross illegally\nSo then they are in the U.S illegally but at the moment that they say I have a credible fear of my safety these Honduran immigrants\nGo into the asylum process and then they're due process allows them to stay in the United states that is the law I've talked to senior immigrations officials about this is talk of lawyers about this that's how this works\nSo we need to take action here beyond just we're going to enforce the law the border that's great that's a good start but if you have this caravan of seven thousand that gets all the way even if it's only a thousand that gets to the border\nThis is going to be they're going to keep doing this they're going to keep doing this it's the best most effective way to get around the legal

was objects and so much of it was Romney's unwillingness to rise to the kind of fight he was in he didn't really understand Trump understands\nAnd he rose to this occasion soda Cavanaugh I was proud of both of them and proud to have defended both of them in this whole process\nBut the biggest takeaway for me from all of this is just how insane the left has become\nLet them has turned into a kind of mass panic a widespread delusion a collective nervous breakdown\nIt's no longer enough for people to disagree with others based on politics they have to shriek into this into the air\nThey have to bang on doors they have to attack old men holding signs they have to harass people in the streets chase them out of restaurants and threatening letters docks members of the Senate threatened the docks

is the mob not just cheering on one side\nBut demanding deal obliteration of the other demanding the arrest of political opponents demanded the harassment of people trying to serve their country people who have served honorably in some cases for decades they don't want to just beat us on the battlefield of ideas they want to be just literally\nWith sticks and fish than rocks\nThey threaten violence because to them ideas that shattered their own sense of their worth and their wellbeing they are triggered by our our thoughts and that triggering they think\nJustifies a violent response we saw this in some of the antics of ... over the weekend attacking people on streets acting like the maniacs they are\nAnd we see this from the way that the less reacts to political defeat we want conservatives won the good guys one with capital\nAnd notice there's really not any gloating there's not an endless victory parade going on television there is in the sense of now that we've\nBeat the other side in the war let's go round in Bay and that all the survivors were not rubbing their faces in it although a little bit of spike no football perhaps as an order\nBecause to us this was just what shouldn't have been done this was just this was right life goes on there are other battles to fight there are other arguments to be had but also in the conservative mind today in America you can have a separation between\nWho you vote for what policies you support what you what you believe in your politics and who you are in your day to day life I don't mean that you don't leave your ideals and beliefs but I mean you don't feel the need to only exist in that fear of what his political\nTo be a good conservative you have to focus on things like\nShooting people with respect acting with honor and decency and kindness things that the leftist media tends to sneer at things that pop culture dominated by the left ridicules\nBut you realize that you can't be a true conservative without doing those things and it's just so much easier in so much more self gratifying so much more satisfying to the self\nTo show up and scream about how to have it all will be the death of millions of women just scream about how the patriarchy is alive and well dressed in stupid costumes and carry idiotic placards and act like the country is falling apart and democracies in peril\nBecause process is still respected in the Senate because the presumption of innocence is a principle that we have maintained understand this if they have gotten away with this plan if the left and managed to sink Kavanaugh\nIt was the beginning of the end of any kind of\nHonest forthright and decent discourse in this country\nBecause anyone who was an effective spokesperson for the other side anybody who was able to wield power and authority on the right and stand up to the progressive project would have been a target for the most vicious mirrors and character assassination\nAnd there would have been this sense that\nOnce the allegation is out there that's all that's required the allegation he's the verdict\nAnd because they were deprived of that secret weapon because the less isn't going to be able to do that they had a complete meltdown click with all of it\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nI mean\nWe're talking about I mean I don't know\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\nThese people are on well\nIt's not just that I think they're wrong that their ideas are bad that they would be destructive to the country where there to be implemented that's given\nThere's something different now\nWe're not arguing over what the top marginal tax rate should be with the left today\nWe're not arguing over how we should pay for various health care entitlement programs although that's a part of the discussion that's not where the focus of the fight is now the main effort the central argument has to do with whether the last ... defeat\nWhether it can handle the fact that it's not always going to get its way and in fact the aid if you will of the progressive left right the ... the part of the mind that is where instinctive impulses lie\nSo I was like I said when they have on people with the ... science and they're down on Capitol Hill and they want to make sure that democracy is imploding from within and they want to smear the Kavanaugh ...\nThat that is apparently now not allowed any more you're you're not allowed to point out that the that that story I was just funny people\nThey're trying to claim that that is inherently admitted meanwhile if Tom's dire was wanting them conservatives would you would be just as quick to point that it doesn't matter what you're saying that they're getting paid these aren't normal people normal people don't do this\nDon't do any of it by the way they don't show up at this screaming at the Capitol and acting like a bunch of maniacs\nThere so there's just so angry over this and here's one theory as to as to why I have a lot of theories about this is good news I've got three hours radio every night to talk to you about it one of them is that I think that the progressive left\nWorries deep down somewhere they worry that we're not for the Supreme Court\nAh imprimatur\nOr is it him him premature [laughter] imprimatur on their policies and believe they could make the argument themselves they need a Supreme Court that will side with them because they had to live with\nJust making the case about this or that policy they worry not just that they could convince the American people but I think\nThey worry that they could even convince themselves\nThey need a super legislature in black robes to tell them that what they believe is right or else\nThey're shaking just a very core\nWhich is why they act out so [noise]\n\nSee news radio

walk past you you leave them alone I think that's aggressive but that's done this is following him down in the subway\nThis was way too close and I don't want anyone to lose sight of that it's not like this was the way was just going to be and the Democrats made a lot of noise but we all knew I was hearing from people with connections to the White House that they were very senior people in the White House when Trump\nPoll Kavanaugh's nomination the kind of people who Trump might have listened to you can probably think of some of the names I've heard from people who know very directly that there was a real whole Kavanaugh movement within the White House\nAnd not talking about from the media or even from random Republican members of Congress or none of them and the White House and it was close and that's why would Lindsey Graham bit it's easy now to see it and say oh well\nDid it really matter that Lindsey Graham jumped him when he did the answers abs so ...\nIf ... ... and also there's this storyline is pathetic more ironic story line\nAbout how Kavanaugh was to mean and his response and so he's not he's not judge like\nEven though he's been a judge for like over a decade and the D.C court of appeals he wasn't being a judge when he was in front of the Senate he was being accused of\nOf being a a predator and he was on the defense stand okay it was being treated like a a criminal even though it's a non criminal proceeding he wasn't being a judge human being treated like a criminal\nThe reason they're so upset though and that they would switch that narrative is that they thought they had him on the ropes they thought they were going to finish them off and Lindsey Graham along with Kavanaugh rallied but this was close and I think that that\nGets lost in all this and it also was not without consequences I had the opportunity to speak to our buddy to ...\nOn rising and that interview will be appearing tomorrow morning if you want to see it you go to heal the TV but I was able to speak about this a little bit and he made some important points I'm\nOne that it's not like there are not consequences for cabinet that came from this Harvard said that he's no longer allowed to teach because they they will once again at the academy they caved to the leftist mob this is how they do things their place Thirteen\nTime particularly outraged at my colleagues and students at Harvard law school those of them who have made it impossible for Kavanaugh to continue to teach their it's rampant McCarthyism at its worst reminiscent\nOf what I experienced what I was a

Communist Party which is to have to put an end to this\nAs right this has to stop\nGoes ditches corrosive to politics this degrades and your roads political discourse and as for the for the left you ever been the ones trying to shame conservatives over Trump and his and his erasing of norms that hypocrisy here is insane factors also spoke about that\nSpecifically about how how one of the primary things you see going on here with the way the left tried to take on Capitol just how hypocritical thing is it's well\nIt's a ...

week ago I was in Washington DC covering the hearing that\nThat took the last bits\nOf testimony from Kavanaugh\nAnd a doctor for it I ran into but a day and it was raining crazy in Washington DC and that's kind of where we set up this week in felons yadda yadda yadda\nBut as I was there I stood inside the Senate office building and covered some of the protests and I asked or tried to ask Elizabeth Warren when she was going to take a DNA test\nAnd she turned and ran away wouldn't answer it got mad at me a than a Jeff Merkley of Oregon another Democrat was there and I asked him\nIf he didn't think Joe Biden statement on FBI reports about sexual abuse in sexual harassment because he said they they were not worth anything if that didn't hurt his argument and he\nDenied knowing about it which is a lie and then he turned and ran away\nAnd I wish I were in D.C today I'm not I'm In the constitutionally protected free speech bunker in the woods of Delaware and I'm watching the reports of the busloads and busloads of people who are headed\nTo DC and I watched some of the marches around the Capitol today with women holding a pre printed signs and women wearing the shirts that say be

opposing judge Kavanaugh\nDon't they get a billion dollars or more in taxpayer funding\nI think they do I think it might even be more than that Planned Parenthood gets a lot of our money gets money from me gets money from you\nAnd when I was at the protest last week a week ago Planned Parenthood it's set up camp\nOn the benches in the quad drained go inside the U.S Senate office building and they were working the room handing out free T shirts to anybody who wanted them free T shirts and they have pre printed signs\nThey also had stationary\nAnd directions on how you could write a letter to your a senator or congressman to tell them that they needed to be vocal about Kevin Oh and this is all\nYour tax dollars at work I thought I thought Planned Parenthood was all about women's health\nAnd I thought so giving away free T shirts to oppose a nominee to the Supreme Court that's that's really what's your all about\nIt seems like we need to pull that funding back\nAnd I know some of you are going to say look Planned Parenthood does things really good things well Planned Parenthood does not do mammogram so anyone tells you as Planned Parenthood did today\nThat uh mammograms are all about breast health they might be but Planned Parenthood doesn't give mammograms they don't provide that\nSo there's a little bit of ... there as well we we have much to get into day well like I

wouldn't doubt it if there's going to be a few Democrats that\nThat the Democrat leadership to just say go ahead and vote for him that way you'll look good and plenty of people um I I ... I really feel for professor Ford\nAs a you know and and and that kept me off because they were mistreated by the Democrats if you look at her testimony especially you know about the the question about what she was asked\nThat you know\nWe have come come to you in California to be interviewed she basically was like I didn't know this nobody told me this lawyers\nAfter Democrats paid for\nIt not informed of this option they want it because they wanted her to come to DC and they even tried to tell her to say oh tell her that's attorney client privilege as she was like\nNo I I I would've I would've entertain them coming to me in and answer their questions in California I think that she really did not want things to go public that she just had some recollection that she wanted to keep quiet and then the Democrats\nSaid this is something we can use to a\nStore and she she will be I feel very badly for her obviously if you listen to her testimony something happened to Christine for\nSomething happened to her at a party but she can't she can't put Brett Kavanaugh there none of the people she said were there could put in there\nThe story changed the dates changed the story about having to doorways at her house\nReally doesn't hold up because one of those entrances was made for an office at the house so it wasn't about being panicked the story about being afraid to fly doesn't hold up because she flew all around the world in big planes in small planes\nI Know that that if you're afraid of flying because my wife is terrified of flying\nAnd if it's for work or pleasure it doesn't matter\nShe thinks if you're in that plane something bad is going to happen so a ... if she truly had a fear of flying it wouldn't just affected in business relations were affected in every aspect of her life so there's just too much there\nTo hang this on Kavanaugh now did something happened to her yeah probably she was in a school where there's a lot of drinking and by the way\nWe'll get into the devil's triangle tonight because they yearbooks are really going to weigh into my conversations this evening I've done a little bit of snooping Jeremy Jeremy or can I ask when you graduated high school\nI graduated in Ninety seven and here's here's a here's here's another thing that I'd like to throw out there to okay you're listening to this\nThis is something I'm not a victim of sexual assault but my wife was when she was younger literally Thirty years ago when she was you know you know early early early single digits\nAnd it was by a\nUm a cousin who was not very mature it himself\nHe he later she did not get the therapy did not\nBecca weight and Roy Moore has happened down here most of the march and this policy what people don't understand is they both ...

monitoring all the Kavanaugh stuff but uh if you drifted over to see\nSpan as ... like me will do you may have caught this moment\nThe Chinese Communist party is rewarding or coercing American businesses movie studios universities think tank scholars journalists and local state and federal officials\nAnd more civil China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion the two thousand Eighteen elections and the environment leading into the twenty twenty presidential elections\nVice president Mike Pence delivering a very serious address about China and what China is trying to do also going on in the background discussions with North Korea over what the next meetings going to be with\nDonald Trump and Kim Jong Owen and this part of the world is kind of important and meanwhile were arguing over high school yearbook and ... and moving and God Knows what else\nAnd I think it's time we paid a little more attention to it so I reached out to a guy who I think is just one of the best in terms of understanding the region his name is Gordon Chang he's an author a columnist you see 'em on TV all the time he gets it at Gordon Chang thank you for taking time to talk to us today\nHow are you I'm fine thank you and thank you so much for this opportunity\nWell I this is kind of an important part of the world you know more than twenty percent of the world's population\nAre resides in a real small region and they have incredible economic impact not just in their area but on us\nAnd I'm I'm a little tense or not so much about North Korea anymore although I think where we should be keeping an eye on them but I think China is starting to get to be\nA a little bolder why why suddenly now are they coming within forty five yards of our\nNaval ships and trying to affect our elections\nWell that's a great question Mike and I think the Chinese have been doing this for quite some time we don't know about a lot of these incidents are we don't know the seriousness seriousness of the incidence\nBecause the navy for quite some time has actually been trying to downplay these um encounters the the Chinese have been acting recklessly and I think that they have sense that we're a little bit afraid of them so they become bolder and bolder\nThe one good thing about the incident that occurred over the weekend is that the navy released a photographs of this immediately and that's important because it says to Beijing back off\nYou know under the current administration we're now see both sides of the aisles think that the United states needs to be more resolute needs to be tougher nice to have a different view of China and that's a good thing and so the restrictions working pretty hard to change and we heard a lot of that\nIn vice president Pence's speech today\nWell if you haven't listened to other people you can find it it's on line and you can do something ... going to C SPAN and watch it which I recommend 'cause I think\nVice president Pence has the potential\nTo be a secret weapon for Donald Trump while the media is watching President Trump kind of freelance and some of these situations uh Mike Pence appears to be very methodical and pragmatic in not only his language but his actions\nAnd I I think he is a real secret weapon for this administration\nAnd that speech to me was welcomed now Gordon Chang if we're looking at China\nAnd like you said the bold steps that they made the bold moves they made this weekend and the things we've seen lately with them a kind of trying to sway public opinion in areas affected by the tariffs\nIs this a reaction or possibly reaction because their economies taken a hit based on the tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed\nWell certainly the Chinese economy right now as fragile um Beijing is pouring a lot of money into the uh the money supply in order to keep things going and and I think that the Chinese understand that long term they can't win a struggle with the United states and\nThat springs so much joy into our lives they're loyal to protect us and smart yeah the smartest our pets might be they can't advocate for themselves especially in the event of a natural disaster Hi I'm Shaun low\nLast year during Hurricane Harvey I saw the impact of natural disaster firsthand mini family suffered the added heartbreak being separated from their pets that's why

shouldn't get too enamored with the notion of having a very prominent wealthy black celebrity like ... so friendly and familiar with the president and working with him on policy issues by the way you know you you can say this about a lot of people in a lot of different situations are we allowed to embrace that he's\nSaying things that we like and pushing ideas that we liked now or do we have to say well a long time ago he he had or even ten years ago whatever was he had a different perspective so would that invalidate same now that's not a standard that we hold any once you've never mind to a celebrity\nSo you know there's a little bit of I don't know if you'd say trust but verify but there's some applause with caution here I think in order for the whole Conyers situation and then there's also the everybody just needs\nTo calm the hack down our meeting was acting like Trump went and play Eighteen holes with Kim Jong on which let's be honest I could probably happen sometime pretty soon but they were acting like this was some\nCrazy thing that he had ... talk to him and saying oh he profane the or profane the\nOffice of the presidency by doing this by cursing in there you know this is the same office literally V. office the oval office where Bill Clinton did a whole lot more in a way of profane stuff\nThan have a guest who cursed but there are no standards the media really applies to any there's there's no there's no truth necessary for what they say oh they just want to find\nI used to hate and to criticize the president and there's always ways to do that here's a perfect example of what I'm Talking about\nJohn of Brazil\nWhom I managed to a debate a few times in the CNN and who was always treated with tremendous difference I mean they really love Donna Brazil at CNN so I was supposed to be there to get a buck slapped if you will\nBucks left gets book a book ... you know what I mean ... bucks left 'em and\nShe told me she interrupted be once and told me to stop interrupting her was a pretty amazing thing I don't know some of you may be even seen that but I was never impressed with her so she was treated out\nAnd she is treated out the following in response is kind of member this was a I think she was she was DNC chair German and then she gave the questions to Hillary remember he got fired from CNN\nShe treated at the following in response to this whole commenting today Kanye West has set us back one hundred and fifty five years\nWish Sojourner Truth could have met with him outside the White House and Frederick Douglass inside the oval office Brock Obama never would have become president with this crap but let's meet ... election day by voting for Democrats I mean the the end of that is fine if she wants to propagandize were Democrats you totally free to do that\nBut just say that Conyers has set back uh I I guess when she says set us back I wouldn't want to put words in her mouth but I'm assuming she means the black community set us back a hundred and fifty five years well this one does the math\nOn that it seems a bug she's making a pretty pointed reference there and\nHow is that what a reasonable rational person would say here you have a world famous black millionaire in the oval office embracing the president of the ... literally embracing I'm giving him a hug\nAnd sharing ideas with them and sharing lunch with him this is the leader of the free world this is a man talking about Trump now Tanya probably thinks he's the leader of the free world\nAmong other things among being a deity ah but there's no there's no way any ... normal human being could look at this and say yeah that's degrading for any group of people never mind for black Americans I mean this is this the oval office\nAnd I think that the way they get to this this is two fold one today they hate Trump so much that they're blinded with rage about him all the time but also they don't really accept the Trump is the president they've they have\nThis is this is true about the less now and it explains a lot explains a lot of their mob mentality and the mob actions in the way that they've been willing to cast aside basic decency and decorum and to justify this behavior to themselves and to others in the media and\nIt's because they don't really think that he's the president they think that he is a fraud\nOr he is a ... an interlopers he's a pretender the throne if you will and so he doesn't deserve any of the respect that one would give president he doesn't deserve any of the deference to the office if not to the man himself\nAnd so if that where your perspective if you were that\nDo looted with with rage or not disconnected from the truth then I could see how maybe you feel that ... hugging this man that they think is such a fraud in the oval office and having this very warm report is demeaning but do you want any normal person that's just crazy it's crazy\nThat is the most accurate way to describe it

themselves as the other and that's what's happening now and we need leadership to bring that back together again\nThere's a Doris Kearns Goodwin\nVery celebrated in the presidential historian or something in the law\nTelling us about how about that they love to do that they love to put presidential historians on TV to talk about contemporary politics I always find them underwhelming just say the least and what they tell us about what's going on today\nIt's nice that a lot of them were usually with the research staff to help them get put together an eight hundred page book that generally people don't read but I don't really need to hear their take on everything going on now because I've written a book about a president from you know Eighteen Seventy I don't really think that that makes them some kind of particular\nVoice of of insider expertise on what's going on today but notice all the criticism there was was actually of the president's tone\n... it's the way that he speaks now I don't even mean the the content of the speech I mean he's the level of his speech and and the sound of his speech now that's a problem she saying Jeb Bush was calming yes Jeb is low energy this long since been established low energy jet\nTrump was giving a rally in Pennsylvania\nAnd you know when he talks about issues relating to to Florida is obviously very concerned his men are cheap there's a big federal response but this is what I mean everything that Trump does Israel I mean when people say things like Trump could cure cancer tomorrow and liberals we're all of a sudden the pro cancer it's true\nIt's not an exaggeration they have involve them their sense of self so much in everything that they're saying and everything that they're they're doing all the time or it has so much

that the less can control\nNow impeachment is in fact a\nParallel process to the legal process that the left can control if they take the house and that's what they are gearing up for so whenever we try to have the argument that Trump was not found guilty\nWhen it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial\nTrump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office a which is essentially whatever\nThe house of representatives decides he is guilty of now they can't remove him from office but the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be\nThat President Trump was impeached by the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption get rid of the uh you know the\nRacism and massage any insects isn't all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say and that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling arguments\nOn policy matters they can't meet us on the battlefield of ideas when it comes to policy so what they do is turn this into a battle of reputational or a

he's ...\nWhich is really what they want to convince everybody about Trump all along but there there's a development in his whole Russia thing today or this is what made me think of this\nThat a lawyer for Glenn Simpson this from the hill dot com I my own website where I work uh I don't want us to my own I obviously don't own a time employee cofounder of fusion GPS told the head of the house Judiciary Committee on Thursday\nThat his client will invoke his constitutional rights not to testify depart defying ... what is that your pie him take away is pie defying a GOP issued subpoenas seeking to compel him to get a closed door deposition\nThe lawyer Joshua Letty toll judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte an electronic letter that Simpson will not participate in this committee's inquiry because it is not designed to discover the truth\n...\nQuote consistent with the September twenty seven twenty anti letter we sent you Mr Sampson who's testimony as a matter of public record will not be participating in a confidential deposition before this committee squirted lawyers for Simpson he'll be invoking his right not satisfying the first and fifth amendments of the constitution\nAh now I understand\nThat this is where people will say based on their politics well if you take the fifth you must be guilty that's not fair the fitness a procedural protection\nAnd there are times when I assure you there will be people that you and I are much more favorably disposed toward who would take the fifth and we would say that's absolutely the right thing to do\nSo it's not just that he's taking offense but it's that there is such a clear pattern in general of people who are tied to the CIA people who were early on big advocates\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump and the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information does not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full scope even of Mueller's probe to become public\nWell when that's the situation I think you do have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here\nYou never see a greater revelation of information from this investigation supported by the people that think that Trump is done terrible things it's the people that think that Trump has been set up an ambush tearing smeared\nThey're the ones they're the ones who want more information out there they're the ones who want us to be able to get the facts and get the truth so I just wouldn't know that they are back in office right now because one I think that Muller knows that you know to to put more kind of\nYou know Ricky ... indictments out there oh we're going to do some more Russian sock puppets you know they're never going to actually sit in a courtroom\nThat would look really to borrow word from before achy ready for the election so it won't be till after the election let me get more information but the the Democrats are all in a little bit of a of a little bit of a bind here\nBecause they don't want to over promise\nAnd and they don't want to make it seem like they're trying to throw this mid term based on all the work that they've already done against Trump\nOr I think it's too obvious for them you know so they're they're laying a little low on the Russia collusion stuff and ... the primary\nYou know that the primary narrative against Trump is very much personal and I think they go more for the twenty Fifth Amendment\nLane here than anything else you know they're trying to say that Trump is just unfit for office instead of Trump is a potent puppet but I Will keep an eye on this and my colleagues of the hill who have been breaking a lot of these stories are they've got more

have gone right up Democrat now I mean they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well which teams are that they can say they're not never Trump but for all intents and purposes they are\nA but why is it that they um they hate this president so much and that there are so many people who come from ... not exclusively government backgrounds\nI I think come from backgrounds where they've spent time in government and they're of the system and all the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one\nHe isn't supposed to be able to do this and I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government\nWho really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management\nOf that other people don't have a right to that once you become a government employee long enough because you become culturally acclimated from being within this bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nYou know you have to be in government to understand government that's that's essentially the distillation of this boy you have to be in government to understand it you know you have to have been a beltway inside or or you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a politician but part of the professional political class in order to be competed in these roles and it's just not true\nAnd I think that makes a lot of people who have power in this country a lot of people who are part of the elites and the establishment to feel uncomfortable because they built their careers and their reputations on the notion that well you know I've you know the the the the Gergen effect\nOr work for for June presidents or Roger ... advisory wars were ... you know ... or ... horse and buggy whip through it offers and you know you get these guys\nTo the whole their whole resume is this long stretch of

it that the party has taken a turn from just being wrong on issues to being dangerous\nOne thing to say the Democrats are ignorant of history and refused to admit\nOr allow evidence contrary to their closely held belief is another thing to say that\nYou can't even have a conversation with them any more about this they're living in an alternate reality and they're aggressive and they're angry and

I don't\nWant to say that that kind of behavior following senators or any other like that official into a restaurant and now with their family I don't agree with that I did not I I\nDon't know I I I Know you've got\nTo get out of line where or\nWhen we saw okay I've got to get to the break we'll answer your question the U.S or is it my behavior no it's not my right people who are upset and angry about the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy that they will not\nBefore you jump in okay\nHe just supposed to sit there you see and get pummeled\nHe's a he's a never Trump conservative or never Trump Republican or whatever and his job he like I I Know because they wanted me to play the role and I wouldn't blame his job to just sit there and just get smacked around by I think there were four lives on that CNN panel including the host for lips and one due to that\nThat that like lab that they that well he's totally correct I mean I I give him credit for at least we want to say I don't see it but they act like it's ... now it's a question of the number one that got me my ... what do you mean it's a mob\nWhen you've got a big that's when you've got more than three people who are together screaming\nIn your face and acting like maniacs because they're trying to have dinner with your wife 'cause they don't like your politics they don't like her political party that's getting into my behavior when you get twenty or thirty or forty people that are doing it which is what we've seen in these restaurants at a minimum\nThat it's definitely my behavior but that that is the word used to describe it but you see there are very sensitive\nAbout using that word they're very sensitive about saying it because they know that their audience is all a bunch of lives and they don't want the lives that feel like anyone standing and mean about the really devoted lives\nYou know there there's a sympathy just because people don't go out and you know where all the black stuff and act like anti ... doesn't mean that they despise anti fun fact I think there are way more Democrats and you're seeing this now who\nDon't necessarily agree with that he was methods but they agree with the message\nAnd they know that the audience the CNN audience does not want to be told hey are there are there's a problem on the left here and people are acting like maniacs mob maniacs no less\nThat's not what the audience wants to hear so they stay away from it it reminds me so very much of what was being ... of what was happening back in the days of black lives matter you guys know what I'm Talking about um black lives matter days there were all these\nIncidents the most probably well actually the one in Baltimore was really well known and then there was one in in St Louis Missouri\nWhere are these incidents where you had a mob that followed onto a protest of some kind\nAnd they were burning down buildings they were looting stores they were throwing rocks at cops and CNN would go from there showing burning building one moment to political analyst later on doing like well it was mostly peaceful protest it was the most peaceful protests\n... mostly peaceful protest what does that even mean\nIt can you imagine if if you just did a very simple thought experiment if you looked at a Tea Party rally circuit twenty ten\nAnd there was anybody throwing rocks at cops there was anybody who was letting buildings on fire they were like oh my gosh look the country isn't in turmoil look at the rioters\nAnd yet when you flip it around and you have people that are saying they're part of this black lives matter movement then all of a sudden\nYou know they're they're not ... you can't afford them is riders you certainly wouldn't ... what was going on even though it was about race and racial animus and claims of racism and never allowed to call it a race riot on TV\nBut that is what it would have been called decades before and if you were to look at what was happening yes a lot of times riots or follow on to demonstrations usually people have to get together first before they can be a big mob that's destroying things you could always have this\nA vanguard of\nThe ... the truth ... cheese and we think about even even terrorists 'cause I'm not saying although ... pretty\nMuch a domestic terror I mean they haven't killed anybody yet but they do attack people just wrote property I'm ... ... and I would note that they will count political violence especially if it means I can talk about like white nationalist they'll they'll say that somebody in writing a swastika reading some racist crack a crap somewhere is an act of\nOf of terrorism when they're counting it up or FBI purposes to make it sound like Islamic terrorism is not the only terrorism I thought the ... but then they won't say that what ... does which is explicitly destructive and violent behavior intended\nTo bring you know certain elements into the into a political conversation they won't call that they won't count that stuff is terrorists and they won't come out as a domestic or ... incidents\nThe support for those people support for that activity is I think what's so surprising that people that they will be hesitant to\nCall these groups chasing people a mob but in a political environment or Rand Paul's wife has to sleep with a gun under her bed because she's got a credible threat of her husband was shot at and almost beaten to death by left wing maniacs in an arm or Ted Cruz can have dinner with his wife\nEnvironment where administration officials are not just told they're not welcome in restaurants or chased out of restaurants because they happen to work for Donald Trump\nIn that climate which is where we are right now that the media would play this game of oh well let's not call them a mob why not\nAre you you're concerned about offending them oh no you're concerned about offending your audience who deep down Democrats are show enraged by their losses or so and raise the American people are not more on their team with\nAll of this that they wanted special birth they want special treatment even for the mob tactics of these angry activist on Capitol Hill and chasing people all around and the anti ... thugs on the streets\nReally tells you a lot about where the Democratic party is right now in this country on the radio on\nBy

how that goes there is nothing that stops the D. O. J. from doing that there's nothing to stop them from doing it\nBut now you started to get into the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people who are operating entirely in bad faith there really aren't any limits on it really ... there aren't any limits\nOn an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows but you do not have the right to be speeding investigation\nIn fact in an investigation\nCan go on at ... at for for years on end bankrupt you some people I Know there's some people have actually taking deals meaning they've they pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigation just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial making all stop\nBecause they they're already\nThe process is the punishment so the same way that also and Obama did this rather speaking about treading constitutional north Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would effectively abrogate immigration law\nAnd say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that the system can be abused if they are going to abuse of I used to be of the mind more of a I guess it's a traditionalist William F Buckley style can serve I used to be the mind up you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that he that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and hope that there'll be better times when there's plenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of the capital and on any issue related uh Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means\nIf they want to do this thing with Hillary we're going to have the ... and we got our video J. really take a good look now that told me who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe under investigation for possible leaking classified material\nLet's let's take a look at ah at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually makes the decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges\nLet's see what the what the deal Jay determination is about Hillary's emails this time around\nAll bought no we we shouldn't drag the country back into that they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country back into that match\nThat must be the FBI by the way\nYou know Rand Paul is that a tough year year and a half\nRand Paul is holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to get a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying stuff you'd think they'd given all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president town you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is that as Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's where we ask you to get a warrant\nThe information you gather in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no constitutional manner to that matter to that data and yet you once and then use it on domestic crime\nAnd that has been our complained for years and years and years that you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree\nI have to say it's a little concerning that given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community were in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these processes work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again\nYou don't remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of Tea Party it is this all happened after we should have been aware that or political opponents in in our own country\nWe're willing to abuse the apparatus of government reporters and purposes and there's been no real change there's been you know instead of Democrats pretending like none of us really happened\nThey thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're really proven is that the government is full of some deep state leftists who are completely and utterly willing to abuse whatever authority they have to achieve partisan and so you'd think it calls for more oversight and maybe some legislation but uh apparently not\n\nSeem it as an honor and privilege to bring in

the central issue of twenty\nEighteen is\nCare I've seen polling suggests this is the case that people are likely to cast votes based upon their perception of health care what is\nReally going on here what is the state of health care right now as it relates to the midterms and just in general what's going on because somebody can answer this question for us over Roy is with us now is the president for the foundation for research\nEqual opportunities also a Forbes editor over great to have you say buck so a ... well first of all is this is this concept what'd you say it's accurate I mean are\nAre we are we seeing data to suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about Trump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the\nHouse in the Senate to one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I've looked at it pretty closely at this particular question I haven't seen any polling data to suggest that health care right now is motives motivating people to turn out\nAh for November of having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say this if Democrats are successful in retaking the house or whether or not to take the Senate if they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow what ever happened the midterms are gonna be over you know the FEC to your listeners know this was seen as the midterms over literally within hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about the\nTwenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge Trump and what's that primary is going to be all about but it's all going to be about\nWho is going to outbid who who's going to be the true blue purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this op ed is he's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning ... you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election where is the last positioning itself but where Democrats position themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on healthcare\nYeah one of the things that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this\nOn your program in the past is that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care as the Republicans are they're\nTalking a lot about this Texas lawsuit which aims to overturn Obamacare the out by attacking with a preexisting conditions provision in Obamacare\nAnd so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying is that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance payments because the pre existing conditions\nOn for protecting you from that from me so there is a lot of these races a lot of talk about preexisting conditions in when I'm On Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know why should we do about pre existing conditions\nSo that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it you're not hearing so much about single payer the single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party official ... an official position on healthcare once we're heading into twenty twenty you're you're confident of that\nI'm certain of it it's just like repeal and replace for the Republicans right like what Republicans wanted to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections and the last ten years right similarly\nProgressive to dominate the left wing primaries on Democratic Party if you don't say you're for single payer you're not going to win\nAt all you're going to have a primary challenge so every Democrat feels that pressure from the left and frankly most of them genuinely philosophically want single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and could never happen\nThey do philosophically would they would prefer government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not gonna they're not going to deny that therefore single air they're going to say yeah I'm for single or they're all going to climb over each other to talk about how pro single payer there\nHow how accurate worthy early GOP projections that

was killed inside the southern consulate in Istanbul, Turkey earlier this month in Riyadh officials say Eighteen Saudi nationals who've been arrested on charges stemming from your show he's death\nYou're going to have some media outlets that act like this is the bombing of Pearl Harbor all over again they're going to anchor this is a tremendous threat to democracy um and that's why when you look at\nThis latest charge here this is going to ... they're going to make a much bigger deal of this this just came out today they're gonna make a much bigger deal of his than ah than they should\nAnd it's because of all these political reasons quote federal prosecutors in the wall Street Journal today have charged a Russian national with conspiring to influence next month's midterm elections according to a criminal complaint unsealed friday the first known case involving the November race\nJustice Department described Elena Alex safe now who's ... yeah you know of a good yeah yeah no vote while it's not an easy one of St Petersburg Russia as the chief accounting of an effort funded by a Russian oligarch and two companies he controls including a Russian company that's been indicted\nBy special counsel Robert Mueller\nBefore the complaint was unsealed friday U.S intelligence agencies had expressed concern over election interference citing Russia and China in a Chinese and Iranian countries trying to interfere\nThey added no evidence that voting or vote counts were affected state and local governments prevented the attempts okay what I've been saying all along is now if you're a foreign government that really doesn't like\nOh you have to do is metal a tiny little bit just a just a little bit of meddling and you get this greatly magnified effect because the media wants to excuse Democrat Party wants an excuse for why Hillary last thank God it with a whole Russian meddling nonsense but\nNow that they've convinced a lot of Americans that already won election was changed because of this this ... this is highly repeatable you can do this over and over it's not that difficult and you don't have to be successful I because they took all context out of the discussion there was no longer did they change\nOh did this actually shift the election or any particular state or or in any meaningful way or was this just\nThrowing out there some means and some fake Facebook stuff and that shifted perception you can never really gauge how much impact that shift had but it did something\nAnd something means that you can always say the election was tainted now Russia or China or Iran any country doesn't even have to be sophisticated they have the ability to with a minimum of any financial outlay with a minimum of of anything from there and they can\nAffect the outcome of an election right they they can change how much a trust we have an electoral process and\nIf you're looking to undermine democracy the great irony here is that because\nThe last thing the Democrats hyper ventilated so much about the last Russian interference campaign every one that comes after this is likely to be\nGreatly exaggerated in the minds of a lot of people and now whenever and whenever one side of the political aisle loses there'll be at least some faction within it back and say she change election you know that's what this election was\nMarred by outside efforts to try to change things so\nAnd I would also note that the Russians and the Chinese maybe even the Iranians are going to get more sophisticated doing this to\n... they're not going to just stop that these are relatively minor and innocuous space but campaigns ah some of the other things that I've been going on they're going to get more advanced\nBut back to this this federal complaint that just came out today or this is what it says in the journal piece ms ... yeah you know of a so I don't know how you say that because you know a\nA managed the effort called project locked which targeted the U.S election and worked with a total operating budget of more than thirty five million dollars between January twenty six sheen and June twenty Eighteen the complaint said\n... ah Mitch K all call her played a key role and what project luck I describe this information warfare against the United states\nInformation warfare is a pretty strong way of saying getting them to try to vote for one side of the political aisle or the other um remember they're not trying to convince us do have a a bloody revolution the streets are trying to convince people to vote for drop or vote for Hillary or\nVote for whomever um but I I just think that we've lost we lost so much\nOf the ability to contextualize this ... and understand what really matters what's really important and and what's not um they're they're getting way ahead of their skis on this one\nSo we've got now now we've got the OJ charges about Russian interference in midterms who wants to guess whether the Democrats are going to wait and see how they do in the mid Germany for making a big deal of this\nAll of a sudden they're gonna on earth a lot more is going to be so much more reporting on this one based on who wins or who doesn't so will stay on this I also want to talk to you about the mob\nOr mobs on the streets and the massive\nCaravan of people heading for the border will\nDiscuss this anti owe so much more uh got

do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is can absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now\nThe fact is we had four dead Americans with a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night a decided they'd go kill some Americans what difference at this point does it make how much\nDo you miss her to you know we want her to give you a little mom does the so you remember what it was like when you had to deal with Hillary all the\nTime [noise]\nAh yes Hillary you probably think to yourself like most normal people would oh Hillary is run for president unsuccessfully twice there is no way that she would be show\nDiluted and so self involved in so self important and Meg Whitman article that\nShe would run again but all I Do listen to that ... and fellow sometimes on the radio he can be quite an impish little little dude and uh she has been saying for the last year regularly that Hillary Clinton may run again\nAnd I keep saying I Know I mean 'cause I'm Crazy\nKnow everyone's going to tell me I'm nuts but oh guess what a you know it's government\nFirst time that I can think of at least twenty Eighteen you have a top a Clinton aide Philippe Reines who is a veteran spokesmen and console yes they are saying that yes\nIt's a it's possible here's resent his political quote it's curious why Hillary Clinton's name isn't in the mix either conversational or informal form of polling as they twenty twenty candidate\nShe's younger the Donald Trump by year she's younger than Joe Biden by four years is it that she's run before\nThis would be Bernie Sanders second time and by the third time is it lack of support jihad sixty five million people vote for her it was a mistake for Democrats to punish Clinton from mistakes you made and twenty sixteen\nShocking last up to her being a failed candidate is an oversimplification she is smarter than most tougher than most she could raise money easier than most it was an absolute fight to the debt\nWhen asked about the likelihood of a running rains responded it is somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it is not\nZero now let me tell you something right now\nAre there is a very very higher than zero much more realistic possibility than they're willing to talk about a ... that she will run and that's why they're starting it as you are right now in terms of what the public really we're expecting one what they're trying to do\nIs just start start rehabilitating that perception they have to take it upon themselves to\nMake the case which is what I hear the Hillary what am I Am in telling all along\nThere's an entire apparatus of people around her who believe that the height of their careers would come when she won that election they have not gone away they have not achieve what they set out to achieve which was to get those different jobs they all have the drapes picked out for their officers they were ready to go\nAnd that was all taken from they believe taken from them by\nThe Russians they believe taken from them by this uh this unholy alliance between ... and Trump and all these terrible shenanigans that went on behind the scenes or so the narrative as I've been telling you is that the only way to set right what happened in the past the only way to make it all better\nWas if they were able to now bring Hillary back and make her the president yes you will be the third time around but give Felipe rain some credit here he's telling the truth about her age about number of times running it makes more sense for who Hillary to run that Biden or Bernie\nMakes more sense first woman candidate won all those she beat burning in the last primary\nBut this is also how desperate they are for a candidate that\nThe case for Hillary from a Democrat perspective the case for Hillary is more rational then the case for most of the other candidates that the Democrats are thinking about right now and they just you know what it is they just can't stomach it\nThey just feel like they had to just show down a lot of nasty stuff\nIn order to push her once again after Obama came out of nowhere in that primary defeat or they they have to do this or they had to do it\nAnd there was a recognition I think deep down with a lot of them that they may have to do it again\nAnd they will they will I'm telling you I think the chance that Hillary Clinton runs right now you're really to give Vegas odds on this is more along the lines of twenty five percent\nI'm not saying it's likely but I'm saying it's a serious serious\nShot that she decides to run and mad wouldn't that just be while\nWe can replace a twenty six you know election in twenty twenty\nAnd all the same cast of characters all over again\n[noise] I mean I'm I'm not sure if people would know it would be a ... it would be a ratings bonanza and the good news is books that\nAre very confident that if that were to happen and guess what\nTrump would again [noise]\nLove ...

storing pet food medical records and supplies and waterproof containers and keep their favorite comfort toy handy this one or this one proper identification microchip\nShe doesn't sound very well adjusted to me is putting that out there\nWhy why why did someone who lives about his drinking\nHe didn't this was one of the more pathetic lives about Kavanaugh he didn't lie about his drinking\nHe said he drank sometimes sometimes too much when you start to try to play around with well look it's not too much like way way too much so it's a law that is completely subjective and that in in no\nRational universe does that would that qualify as perjury or but you heard people saying oh there's a lot about his drinking he did not live at a strict he said he didn't blackout and he said that he would drink too much sometimes\n... the Democrats went so far is to try to put high school and college beer drinking on trial in an effort to try to stop that but it was pathetic which goes to show that they have no scruples nothing stops them nothing prevents them from you know just going all in all this stuff\nBut that was Ted Cruz in an airport being heckled I'm being you know yelled at by people who are truly angry at him and I wish I could be there well for a lot of reasons one is you just said them Ted Cruz didn't do anything to you\nYou would never occur to me and I know never heard any of you listening to this to go up to a stranger and just start getting up in that person's face and yelling at them\nBecause of what they stand for publicly when it ... it just would never occur to me now\nI'm not saying to talk to somebody to engage somebody and if you was elected represented ... but this is yelling this is heckling citizen trying to have a conversation I'm sure\nThis is not meant to in any way be constructive they're they're not engaging Ted Cruz they're mouthing Ted Cruz this is what they do they like the foreign mobs and also reminded\nMe when she started to say all these women came forward and tell their stories\nThis was a sensitive area of the whole Cavanaugh a situation that I don't think I spoke to much about it and it's not because I didn't I was unwilling to her didn't want to you I just had so much else going on there but you had all these women who were coming forward and we're telling their stories of being sexually assaulted\nAnd that's\nIf if any woman who wants to do that that's obviously her right and she deserves you know support and sympathy\nBut that created this very dangerous to due process phenomenon of well it it because something bad happened\nTo me and the person lied and got away with it or because I didn't bring charges a because someone attacked me speaking again for other people who are in the third person it means that this this case should be influenced by that\nThat's that's crazy this is just\nA it's not just a foul it's not just a logical fallacy it's a dangerous thing for people to believe you imagine if I had a uh I I was on trial for a steely right I was in ... for fraud\nAnd people started showing up at my trial and they were saying well someone stole from me so he must be guilty\nYou'd say well that's irrelevant it's completely irrelevant but for the left it was a\nWidespread talking point the whole cabinet thing you'd hear people I I I saw other people that I Know from the media world too there are other talking heads you said you know I I Want to come and talk about my sexual assault now and again that's fine for context and background and all that\nBut just because somebody was sexually assaulted by some guy who's not Brett Kavanaugh\nDoes not mean that that has anything to do with whether Brett Kavanaugh was guilty of any kind of sexual assault or not\nThis is really elementary stuff and that this was a something that people are losing sight of and a lot of people are losing sight of just I think went to show how completely over the top and an over politicize this entire thing had had become\nA there there is a a mass hysteria in this country that Democrats have reached this point where I don't think that the king ah logically\nAbout many of these issues they just want to show emotion they want to show rage and they want to signal there virtue to the world\nAnd they don't want to engage in debates or or discussions on any of this they just expect that other people will listen to them other people here are their thoughts and because ... there's so much claiming a victim status\nNow when everyone's saying oh I'm a victims do you have to listen to me ah their expectation is that they won't have to justify\nThese ideas that that the justification just comes from the emotion behind it and from the identity of the particular speaker of the justification that becomes well because I feel this way um everyone else has to value my thoughts on it because I suffered some terrible tragedy it was very\nTroubling to see this happening and it's a mob mentality to bring this back to the Trump is saying here you know do you want\nPeople who easily get swept up into mob thinking to be the ones who are electing representatives who also whip up the mob in this way and you know there's been not nearly enough condemnation\nOf the kinds of tactics that the left has been embracing recently and I think there's been a lot well we know there's a lot of endorsing of it but it's been not nearly\nA enough and I find that a fund that\nDisquieting to say the least so there you have but you know we're gonna talk this quiet and\nStupid celebrities are all over the

form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body's still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamins these three is\nThe activated form so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the ... going to end up going up and out through the roof where it should be wow\nSo Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short developments and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for\nPregnant women is very very important ... people in their forties that's the way you know you start and more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you'd start feeling sick or you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body and not functioning mhm\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on this formula\nImagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done in the may ... clarity\nYou know this is more and more important as we go along

everybody\nFive K. C. S. J.\nFive Ninety Days yesterday dot com and on your phone with our by arguing\nThat other states and other rally ... Fox News President Trump hosting a campaign rally in al ... for combat Republican senator Dean Heller\nIs that people are going to act senator dean to protect\nWhile now so I've done that is also a section for interviews a section for monologues and some some news stories of love to inside\n\nIt turns out I started new story this morning that nobody one what was the mega millions\nOr was it the power of a bill when it was nobody won the billion dollar jackpot\nIt's going to be one point six billion come on to what the hell is going on one point six\nDollars if you imagine\nThat would be nuts that would be absolutely nuts [noise] All right let's talk about Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren\nFor decades has been claiming to be a Native American or as I like to say American indian why am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes if it's okay for them it's okay for me\nShe's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact\nFor admissions to schools for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first woman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\nShe's been making this clean but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence to suggest that she is in fact an American Indian\nSo the president like he's apt to has been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls are both gone is I was just funny as hell people who are offended by it are very smart and don't have a sense of humor\nYou don't like Rachel does all who's white\nLike Sean King who's white\nYou know they're both pretend to be black Elizabeth Warren\nIt seems has been pretending to be an American Indian\nWhat's your well because my cheekbones proves it no that doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nSo president been calling around he said do a DNA test if you could prove to be that you're an Indian or give it a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess it really does a DNA test get to the test back and\nGives the results of the Boston Globe which is the far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write those big story that you prove that she's Native American they say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second Native American\nTo as little as one one thousand twenty four ths Native American and then the Boston Globe out to four hours later updated and corrected and say well the most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth\nNative American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into the actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was was South American native tribes\nAnd maybe she got South American blood or maybe South American made of blood both the probability is one one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American this group that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than listen to warn that's affected\nMe making it up as a fact she's not America in American indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved yourself or did he or\n\nShe is so not American it'd be about the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now\n\nOr when they did bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist or a\n[noise]\nGerald the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation vets the world in which we live\nGuy looked at stake in it\nAny time you go through this week thinking that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week and I think to yourself while she will use Native American and by the way this is not a story anybody any Russian even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse through lying\nTo get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this nobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up again\nAnd you ask yourself what she's thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this for even a second yet for some reason we\nHad to have her thrust of this in our face again why decided I had to do a a a pax power to you about the color Pocahontas all have their free will come back if you're not familiar with my packs parodies I'd take a song that you know and love and I ruined it by changing the wars in singing it\nAbout a current event Pocahontas when we come back your phone calls as well one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe packs dot coms there\nOn the radio on the Web five Ninety eight I\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in

present in the studio check it out now\n\nWhen radio stations across the land Joe ... was with her in the room emails All right here's a live video feed is there as well as easy to get through tough thing just press play\nWhere you open it up on your on your device or when you open it up on your computer or you've got the weekend with Joe ... had a great opportunity to talk to my friend Eric Trump earlier this week of course the son of president Donald Trump on all things that you would imagine we talked about Eric I appreciate Joe are you\nHey bags how are you I'm living the dream but it's it's going great today I'm ... and we've got a big debate too and I was you know it's going to be Ted Cruz speaking on a Robert ... going in so ... for some reason I'm not sure why but that's going to happen and it's only ... tonight\nIn that race is probably not as close as the media's pretending but we really can't take it for granted right\n[noise] let's see if they gave her a thing for granted people have to go out and they have to vote and the the amount you I hear people say to me what my guy guys Trump is on the you know he's on the ballot or something I could go and vote and I go please you can't think that way you have to get out and vote idiots so critically important I mean\nGo as a country we're winning I mean everything about our country is winning right our economy is on fire it's four point two percent GDP Growth three point nine percent unemployment the lowest unemployment in the history of our nation we've got three percent wage growth which is the first time wages have gone up and sixteen years\nYou know we have the largest military spending we have the largest tax cuts in history a manufacturing is coming back to our nation four one K. through the roof of small businesses are paying Fifteen Percent less in taxes than they were\nA year ago which is just created such a you know financial engine um I mean we are doing so incredible and that's before you start talking about you know president for and what you need to be done you opioid crisis he's taking on a Supreme Court justices and\nPrescription drugs no one wants to talk about that everything that he's done to lower the cost of prescription drugs you know something that is is is so keen on his mind you I'm you know and no one wants to talk about it but it it it's we're winning we're not getting ripped off by China anymore we're not getting ripped off by Mexico anymore you know we're finally negotiating good trade deals\nYou know the Chinese economy right now is you probably know better than anybody is down you know ... almost twenty five percent right right oh while America has the strongest economy that's ever hatch who's winning this thing right and and\nThat's what he promised the American people he was going to do he promised the American people he was going to come in and he was going to win we're no longer get used to be used to the country and but people have to get out there and they have to get out and vote\n... Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump Jr absolutely right but I watch these races each very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country you remove all the advertising is saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies Ted Cruz give a tax cut to his corporate friends the top one percent of the vast majority of tax cut everybody else got nothing ... that's not true everybody who pays taxes got a tax cuts and corporations will employers Scott tax cuts are all making more money some people get bonuses so\nHow do you think about the large when you see them walking around with him about it\nHonestly they are truly some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I've never seen anything like that I've never seen deception I've never seen the dishonesty of politics again this is this in a world right where business people who are not we don't we don't come out of a ... a political world these people are truly the most dishonest people in the entire world I mean\nYou look at the amount of small businesses in this country right or\nYou know dozens and dozens of millions of small businesses right all across our\nOur nation they're getting they're paying Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he flashed regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point seven percent unemployment is ... you have the lowest\nHispanic unemployment the lowest African American unemployment in history\nThe lowest female unemployment in the history you know what I mean it's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where\n... you know this better name but you have a trade deal with with with China where\nIf you had the product to them they were charging twenty five percent twenty five fifty percent and terrorists right where they can make the same product over there they could send it to you and we were in charge of anything so I mean who do you think's gonna win that battle I I mean it's absolutely unbelievably we we over tax companies we over regulate it you know companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre that the economy of this country went crazy I mean it it it it's going through the roof are they the\nStock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote if you have to realize the lies and deception\nThat some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K. you know every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases believe\nMe people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that and then they terms but again people have to go out and vote\nFor Trump to sort of president Donald Trump ulcer jumping national interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people go ... or give us raises millions more people got ... a small businesses are adding\nEmployees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone be slashed employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada should no way we're going to do it then maybe the deal Mexico said no way to do it but maybe it'd be all do you use it in a way we're going to do with them they made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the back and how we are to check\nWell how about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare wrote touting Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world has to be able to\nKeep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars healthcare costs you know flew through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug um legislation that road has drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs if you look at right to try you look at so many of these

for taking a ton of want to jump into the guys know movie a which show that piqued my interest the other day and that's why I reached out to you but you're not start with Elizabeth Warren it turns out is one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American some out in the left BDO Michelle now says she's basically like a Cherokee queen I mean that's right what am I missing here\nShe has been vindicated I I'm I'm I'm never\nFlabbergasted by the lengths to which the identity politics left will go to write you try and unwind\nBlatant life this is a woman who advanced her her career by manufacturing a a Native American ancestry that it's been debunked over and over and over again and I I really do believe that her staff was\nConvinced that by releasing their results of a test\nThat showed that cheap possibly had Native American ancestry six to ten generation back yeah but that was based on a proxy of Native American blood line right and in other words the the researcher used South American\nGenetic markers as as some sort of of estimation for whether or not she really at this ancestry come on Joe this is someone who identified as a woman of color right in order to secure a position in a in a prestigious Ivy League university\nIn a very real way Rachel does all is about as black is this woman is Native American and you're right they're using like ... as tech they're hoping praying that the south American blood somehow has some native blood and there is no proof in other words she's wider than I'll ever be an Internet site and in\nFact by statistics that were quoted and none other than the New York times it turns out that this one thousand one one one thousand twenty fourth fraction of a possible Native American bloodline makes makes her last\nThe ... in

I appreciate your how're you doing good how are you doing\nI'm living the dream in really glad to have your own it would be a it would be bad for me to not start we're the most important story of

back off on a structural\nDamage um because you had basically about category I\nUm I talked to some of the sheriff's they're um they're actually progressing ahead of schedule which is good I think uh\nYou know one of the threat neighboring counties golf county are going to have their power on by the end they it's supposed to be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two but you know there's just certain amount of damage that weren't going to have you know\nIt's secondary obviously we're talking around a shared is former congressman he's a Republican running for governor ... Gillum um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that voting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are\nTraditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast I'm going to be out is that getting to handle is that getting taking care of who's working on that\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations for the people that were displaced\nOr just for the people you're still in the county but I think you're looking at an additional polling\nLocation and then I think there's going to be a consideration or if you are just ... or you can vote and other county and your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that and by then that\nThat's something that's doable and I think that they will look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time these are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very stiff minded so I think a lot of them are even though they got a lot of there's\nGot to deal with I think they're going to appreciate I have an opportunity to cast a vote\nIt is a Republican around a shared is running for governor would reach beautiful around you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm good I grew up in South Florida was there for Twenty one years and I love to go back all the time my mom was there my sisters are there and I thought I understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there's there is a sea change that happening since I moved away that I didn't see come in and and the southern bureau Florida that it's very heavily populated he's having a fight whether it's center writer's center left but a lot of like the school districts and school boards and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenge is good for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good track and I mean I think if you look at South Florida for the Miami Dade County huge energy with Cuban American um other Hispanic like Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism they don't want to see\nSocialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country or we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way and Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country that had been in Congress\nYelling and hostile to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent in the bbs movement against Israel they say Israel to genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great the huge at one of those it\nGillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA total of indivisible capitals so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway and areas\nThat may be a Republican wouldn't cause a Democrat even though their party has drifted more and more anti Israel in Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't this time they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really aligned with the radical left\nWhich is really a very hostile to Israel now\nHe's in he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and it'd be government is also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's\nIt's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic\nOr Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have done it was like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy don't the day that they have always been able to I think that the the Hispanic vote is not monolithic I made in Florida you know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics in South

organized effort that does at least some bit of training or at least I'm\nAll right Bob I Want you to be on the left side of the church and Hank will be on the right side of the church for most masses is it that kind of thing or is it just like your brain surgeon you're gonna bring your going okay ... how how detailed is it\nUm I don't think it's a hey you bring your offering like on um these are people who have concealed carry permit so they are trained we also have law enforcement officers to attend our church and then there are staff are trained who um just quietly patrol the church in the parking lot\nAnd do most people don't know what I'm most familiar or attending no they would not know that is correct why why not\n[noise] um it's just sort of low key we want to be conscious of safety in our church and um you know just keep the the members of the conversation at our church safe so it's not a big deal\nWhat you want to keep them safe but we do ... let me see if I understand that as you want to keep them safe but ignorance that there are people there with guns that are are are there by um by plan\nNot necessarily ignorance oh we're pretty tight knit group\nOver your tightened it grew shouldn't shouldn't people shouldn't people know who's who's carrying and not\n[noise]\nI'm ... and other words why not go up there and say hey parishioners\nGiven what's happened and other churches Texas what happened to synagogue you should know that we have people here who are concealed weapon holders who have volunteered to be part of our security detail in fact if you want more information to be part of it comes after after the service\nBut you ought to know that thank God we got concealed weapons here are and we're going to protect you from that'd be a nice thing for them to to hear\n[noise] um I think mostly they know that I think most\nWhat how do you know they don't\nGo there and you know because like I said most of the people have heard of that church\nUm have been there for many years so they sort of what's happening [noise] um I can go and I I have my conceal carry permit and if I Choose to I can take my hand I don't necessarily tell anybody that why would I that's why I don't carry\nAnswer that question is why would you is to let people know that when you come here we are trying to keep you safe and also\nGuns are good in the hands of good people in in this church the guns are in the hands of good people in case a bad person comes credit thing for them to but I I guess what I'm saying I'm advocating that you advertise that to the people in your church\nSo that they know it and and\nAnd hopefully I'm I'm I'm pushing a pro gun agenda maybe very up front on this\nI think it would be good for them to do\nWell again I think most people who attend church do know that we have people who patrol the ground it would only ... who is now\nUm who\nYou know comes there and it may not be immediately or parents what's happening but\nBut I I get the feeling like you don't want them that it's kind of this insight that I'd rather make it\nI'd rather make it\nVery obvious and here's why because then people go oh my God that's crazy and some people go oh no that's good and before you know it having the conversation of are there people concealing guns in my church is that real or not and it makes it more acceptable and easier for other churches\nWere not as advanced and open to the idea as yours\n[noise] no I agree with that\nI Would um I guess I'm saying you're you're being evangelical about your God be evangelical about your gun rights as well and this is an incredible opportunity to do just that\nI agree with you that's a good idea\nThere you go see all come in your view on I'll I'll I'll come in and give the sermon someday big effects for the call I really appreciate it let's see if we can squeeze jak in here jak we've only got a less than a minute so it's all you\nAre jak welcome\nJak going once jak going choice oh hello hello yes I can\nI say you got pretty much it was my point them that a lot of conversation I'm I'm very much pro people milling about in their church have a group of other parishioners and there were people you're putting your faith and to protect you don't even atrophy\n[noise] um I Would advocate more on the side of you know part of maybe after the sermon that group of people stay behind and practices you know this you know this way\nOr the cafeteria will be closed after today's service we're having target practice\n\nA live live round firing I like that idea\nYeah maybe that I mean he certainly you know because you know in the event or something like this you know the goes from zero to a hundred miles an hour very quickly\nThat I got to run back to the Gulf let's stuff I'll be back tomorrow in for Michael Brown wherever you go whatever you do bring liberty with you\nKeep it here maybe that's why\nSprings Colorado is accurate ballots [noise]\nFive Ninety Casey is Jay\nJay on

on your smart speaker new stock by Ninety KCBS Jay\nOff the wider world brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nRather than fighting back\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nKevin McCarthy ... ended for so long back fully funds President Trump's border wall expands caseload people lives in Brooklyn or legal immigrant and insurers only American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump\nThat's conservative I was like Kevin McCarthy\nAlso ... I feel like that's how I mean for the wall I had to tell us when we're likely ... way no one wanted\nThat any of us would do anything in our power to prevent this kind of a master from happening to help anyone who was caught in such a horrific circumstances and now we do what we can with in some cases direct aid and assistance but also just just prayer\nAnd uh and words of support and everything else that we can do\nFor the Jewish community in this country\nAnd yet it immediately turns into a political issue\nAnd without\nA moment self reflection without taking just to be sure let the American people more than\nThey make this about Trump\nThese people who do this every day on every issue at all times are are sick they have a problem they really do there are no longer capable of being objective last week we were told\nThat there was a bomber who Trump is responsible for it because this guy would already called it a bomb threat you know over a decade before Trump's presidential run and that a a a career criminal clearly you know psychological problems\nBut Trump's responsible because he criticizes people in the political arena and those are the people that were being targeted they can't point to Trump ever ... ever inciting or or calling for violence against any of those individuals but\nSay that Trump is basically responsible did they use these kind of weasel words they'll say oh well he's he bears some share of the blame and you know 'cause they know the Trump didn't pack the bombs himself you know Trump wasn't wasn't crushing a glass to use the shrapnel for they're not that crazy I suppose they're not that stupid\nBut they'll say that Trump was the reason for this in some way and what the point you as well he had his van this guy had this van say are covered in Trump's stickers covered in all this pro markup paraphernalia\nAnd so we had to deal with this last week we talked about on the show now\nWell here we are over the weekend there's this terrible shooting on on Saturday on on the Jewish Sabbath\nAnd\nWe are told that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically Trump was too friendly and chew favorable and too much of a friend to the Jews\nIt's still Trump's fault now\nIf we take this theory at face value this theory that Trump is just raised hate in America let's be clear that that means that now Trump is responsible no matter who in gauges in a hate crime against anyone else you know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic you know hate crime in this country let's say you know\n... or ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremists let's just put it this is a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault\nI Want to know where the lines are drawn here\nAnd I think the answer by the way they would claim it's Trump's wall because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were radicalized it would be because of Trump's anti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too\nIf they you know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere at Trump's fault because he has implicitly encourage them they'll say if a anti Semite who is anti Trump\nYou know you get on this list doesn't matter who does Trump is always responsible\n\nNo matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there's violence and bloodshed here in America and there's\nThere's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness at it's at the root of it all eat is Trump's fault they say this is delusional\nAnd it's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe that he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time\nIn ways that I Can't even begin to fathom\nI I'm I'm paying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live eat and brief politics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and ... and such you're talking about sometimes no I'm like\nWhat are they what it will play something for you later you'll here's what is that even me who are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time and so they they talk about division as they are creating divisions vicious how you know that the left cannot be taken seriously on this\nThey will try to escalate rhetoric\nWhile saying the rest of rhetoric needs to be de escalated they'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate\nIn this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side is bad\nOh\nThat seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents\nLet them beats you into submission bludgeon\nYou into silence on issues that matter to you by attaching all these issues all these problems all this violence is nothing to\nDo with it they're calling President Trump and some of them and President Trump grew up in New York City he's ... as did I which is a city that has\nI Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world Crump is is has had countless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out but you know he was Jewish his son in law's Jewish market converted to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti\nSemite not even a little bit not even close but they say this\nThe media says they pat themselves on the back oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power know you're a bunch of destructive little individuals that are saying this\nIt's immoral to make these claims it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else who hates the president who justify this his position for Jews decides\nTo be violent engages in this in this replicate crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did and that's in a guy\nTrying to track attach Trump to this though it's just show intellectually dishonest each show unfair and\nIt just goes to show you that there's there's no effort in good faith there is no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down let's have a different a different kind of conversation going for it let's talk about policy let's come together as Americans All right you know the press is under assault by the press drives I I agree with\nTrump and that the press does drive a lot of this because the press is full of a bunch of preening self obsessed self righteous jerks\nNot all of them obviously and I know is ... I'm telling you what Ninety percent of the media is like\nThey are not good people\nThey're not honest or not ethical it's all about the self it's all about the agenda they are activists posing as truth tellers eighties destroying this country from the inside they are the ones undermining institutions they're the ones undermining public trust\nAnd they turn around and accused everybody else it exactly that they tell you that Trump won't take responsibility they take responsibility for nothing\nWrong story after wrong story all critical of Trump oh that's just a coincidence as if we're idiots we're really supposed to believe that yeah sure it's just a coincidence\n\nThey are disgraceful and they're tearing this country apart and I have to say that it's very frustrating as well because if the if we were able to focus on what's really happening in America and the than the direction of the country right now and how we're all doing\nThis country is doing very well this country is on the right path\nBut the left can't make a fair argument about why it's not so what do they do they make it about a motion to make it about anger and viciousness and destructive\nPolitics and lots and that's what they're doing that's where the number the president\nUm we're gonna continue to see this unfortunate where we're going to talk about the caravan coming up some big updates on that for\nYou as well as um some more following the last week with a bomber and and we we got a whole bunch of show planting so stay right there I'll be right back on the radio\n[noise]\n\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making an online purchase or simply accessing your email could put your private information at risk you're being tracked\nOn line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile Internet provider that's why I just wanted to take back my privacy by using express VPN expressed VPN has\nEasy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background of my computer phones and tablets\nTurning on express VPN protection only takes one click expressed BBN secures and ...

Life but it is telling them that what you're doing a is okay and that's why yes there are always been an anti Semitic incidents in American history\nNationalism goes hand in hand with anti Semitism the entire idea of anti Semitism is to put shoes outside the body politic outside the death of ... of ... and that's what Donald Trump dies that's his fame if that's what his party is now committed to doing\nA limitation is rhetoric and the president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point he doesn't dog whistle teams there's megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is leading to violence directly\nDirectly leading to violence they say it is not\nSomewhat or partially Rumsfeld I mean I saw a a an editorial about this over the weekend in the Washington Post no less saying that uh\nIt is directly somewhat you know that ... they'll always one of his qualifier it's Trump's fall to what extent or you know drunk Trump's you to hold some some level of of the blame here uh this is this is disgusting it's disgraceful but when you have the\nIndividuals in the media who\nHave taken Trump's entire presidency so personally and as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are are there are no limits really on the bio but they will throw at this present there are no there's no good faith there's no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him an angel supporters to all of us remember it's\nNot just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this\nEvening hatred of the Trump voter to oh that's a part of the anti Trump movement they despise the butter they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled\nThey have figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party I figured out that we've made this bargaining were good with it were like yeah I like Trump I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes but I think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now so they hate us\nBecause of all that and that's why they feel completely justified in saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the differences it was always on the fringe in the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's ah never validated that\nUh what's happened and what's so extremely dangerous about this issue now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories edited is telling them these people that it's okay that they're getting a a blessing to do this\nYou know it's it's interesting that that you can go on TV that that Dana Milbank Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he is explicitly openly repeatedly condemned this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump ... why does in Trump condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago ... well he hasn't denounced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and I will say well we're on a second Trump has called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate and he said this many many times and they'll say well the wind is from talk about white nationalist\nSo much you can't with folks you you know there's nothing he can do that will make them stop calling him a racist stop calling him a white nationalist they they do not extend\nThe most basic level of good faith do them in any of these discussions and and they love to try out these these fake conservatives in these fake Republicans like Jennifer Rubin who is that she is the queen of fake Republicans washing post still list or as a Republican when she writes thing which is just amazing\nBut you know she she blames Trump not just for\nWhat happened over the weekend what happened last week but for the overall increasing hate in America she says like before\nI got a ... gallon ... faith that we've had at fifty seven percent tax and the last year and anti snack hate crimes\nI Would say to them you are the ones who are out of step with our society [noise]\nYou are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of the dream that is America [noise] and this country because of what it stands for will not stand for your comment to [noise]\nThe greatest president in my lifetime\nWith the possible exception of Donald Trump\nWill see how it how it goes we'll see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what the full measure of his accomplishes look Reagan defeated Soviet Union and probably save the planet from annihilation so that that's a that's a tough one to that's a tough one to be that's a tougher record to compare against\nBut Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way but I play that for your just because I I think that it is helpful for all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other those of us who are conservatives\nThat as our movements and our ideology our belief system\nOur principles\nAre rooted in a respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty\nThat's that is the foundation of our of our belief system that's where all stars and so\nTrue anti Semitism Andrew raises when I say that with the qualifier true because we know the left calls everything I Do some of the calls everything racist I mean they're they use it as a political ...\nTrue anti Semitism and racism and uh and and and bigotry is not just non conservative eighties anti set a goal to conservatism\nBecause if we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with an ailing noble rights and if we're not all equal\nIn the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there was no such thing really as conservatism edit conservatism as we know it in this country does not exist\nIt it is not possible to be a conservative and believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that\nThat they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal worth\nAs human beings and as citizens of this great nation so when the last\nTry so hard to create this perception that people who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right I mean the right\nIt would mean meaning all of it I was at its peak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that day 'cause of themselves and the right you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way or they conservative though\nYou know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing or left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective right the left in this country is all about the collective and there are about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in the common good as defined by a core of elites that all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leave as elites and separate\nFrom the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to beat the other side politically which would be us we are the individual is we are the individual rights we're all God's creation we're all\nHuman beings in this struggle together and help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life\nAnd that has an obligation on all of us um when when they try to make this case that racism and anti Semitism in these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I\nHave a a real feeling of uh of outrage at that\nBecause it's show on true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them\nA it is a shame that so many of the\nClasses that the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really\nBelieve and I know this from talking to them they really believe that conservatives are racist they believe that\nAnd you and I said you knowing that that is a lie that's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left\nThat advocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender\n\nThey're the ones that want these differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with with race and gender and these other differences among among human beings\nAre when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear that our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people and\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two parties this is why Democrats do get show there I said triggered when they just\nBrought up that they are the Democrats are the part or a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats\nAnd the Democrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how do the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they show what where's their rage directed that has been the aid that has been at the core of the Democrat Party\nThere's always been an intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding the constitution and\nThe rights of each and every individual and natural law that underpins all of this that it's not really just about what the founding fathers status at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths about human beings\nWhat is always true about people what is always good for society\nTo promote and what does always necessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn those universal truths are at the heart of conservatism\nAnd so it's just it is the ... opposite of a true conservative to believe that first in less than because their skin color is a person is less than his agenda [noise] less than because of religious [noise] that it's not who we are [noise]\nAnd I know that you know that and I know that that I Do think\nThat is worth sometimes taking a step back and just [noise]\n... exactly why that is the [noise]\nA lot of fakes in frauds out there and a lot

departments trying to stop the Trump administration's policies Guyger\nSays this actually goes really foreign really deep and I'm Still doing a lot of investigative work around it to see actually for

caravans at the time and and and and since then I've been small and it really sort of picked up numbers over the course of time but now with say get a full\nAnd they and if this one reaches and ... and it ... it conveys a pull factor into the United states to say that the U.S does allow even some of those people in\nThe next one you're going to see it will be fifty thousand and the one after

solving and and therefore shift the voting passenger solving that will shift\nThe direction of I mean I often say this you know the our civilization western civilization is still fighting the Spanish civil war it's still litigating in left but since the authoritarian right\nThe difference is the media jumps on the authoritarian right and exposes them for exactly where where they are who they are where the money comes from someone into full nothing of the so ever happens to the hard line socialistic authoritarian that and I mean by the way the Maxine Waters left ...\nAnd this is where all of this traces its reached factor 'cause he's a true sort of boulevard and socialists or the ... and these ... uh I'll tell you this I mean I'm starting from a position of looking into the federal

I guess I Do know but it frustrates me that the left just dismiss this out of hand was\nYes well it gets dismissed for civil or is it just because it's the truth it's just like the left most dismiss off things that are the simple\nObvious solution that would obviously solve the problem and therefore the left is forced to hate it because they have to live in a world of make cards everywhere we truly care about everywhere you truly want to protect the place that the target or potential target\nAs an armed guard at ... that's called security that's the norm that's the real world but\nEven bringing up an actual solution is the horror from the left who they think the only solution to disarming every ...\nI just can't imagine the circumstances where I'm In a place really speaking a lot of people do not you know you're you're you're not expecting that Sarah Oh it depends where you are right I I don't know what it was like in the Pittsburgh synagogue I'm guessing probably none of the you know not ever arms or you know I don't know of another congregants I shouldn't say river arm\nUh but I Know there are some churches in the south where I was people are All right I mean it it depends on where you uh did that this is automatically a bad idea I think it just goes to show how ideological out of the reaction to this is because if I'm sitting there and I see somebody who's got a side arm\nAnd that's that's either a law abiding gun order showing their side arm war is trained security or orbit perhaps off duty law enforcement the last off it ever goes through my mind is oh well I'm less safe now Jesse I mean this seems very basic\nWell it seems basic few bucks because you were you you acknowledge the way the world really is but I I one thing I have come to grips with it\nHow frightening guns of those who have never experienced it never held them never shot one never been taught the basic safety about them it really is a terrifying thing for people who don't know they look at it and honestly it sounds crazy they see the thing is just going to start shooting\nAnd then I think you make a really good point and you know I Know you're not just a Texan but also were a marine so you've got double firearms familiarity baked in there\nBut you know you you look at at the the cultural differences in the very very blue areas versus a lot of the rest of the country you know when I tell people that I went to a a camp as an eleven year old where we were firing rifles they look at me like I'm nuts\nSounding but it just goes to show that part of the political and cultural divide we have now in this country is exactly what you said it's not just that people don't have similarities with guns all that's a big part of it they've also been raised to think or they they've been led to believe by their peers in those around them\nThat guns except in the hands of the states are always a bad and also by the way Jessie the people who are part of the state apparatus meaning there aren't police or military who want to have guns or at best suspect and\nKids are not they've both shot fires before real gun not just Bebe gun shot guns they're familiar with them they have had gun safety drawing they know where the weapons are in our whole they know they're never allowed to touch them and last time around that light and guess what\nThey're safe with them but you but as you mentioned a cultural issue and I understand having lived in the northeast I've lived all over\nHow people view it differently\nBut here in Texas and other places that I've lived it is the norm for people to carry in church I put up with the other day I think you are in saying if you were a license\nTo do so to not have your weapon on you in a place of worship you have mass amounts of people that are prime targets for evil sitting there with their back to the door stop\nLiving in this rosy world of make believe and acknowledge the world as it is sick monsters like this come back is not the last one on earth I promise you so you you carry in church\nAbsolutely I I carrying church everything was real if your city but in church a hundred percent of the time I'm Jerry loaded on my ...\nAnd they just it's really you would love this we have these things called now this is not a church I go to we have these cowboy church where people will just show up in boots and gee they ride horses to church\nIt will open to carry firearms in church the one my buddy goes to he has a Copenhagen in his lip as ...\nNow you can make fun of that if people will is so absurd redneck caricature but the bottom line ... nobody's shoot Netflix up\nI Would think so I think that I think it's a fair point so I just again a if we're going to talk about solutions real solution should be treated at least or at least real\nOr you know attempts at risk mitigation I mean solution might be due strong words at least be taken all really just a cultural a cultural divide issue for them and and the virtues signal have guns bad and people with guns but this is what I was they ... the lea left opposes firearms it really is a\nDividing line between the kind of people that the ... lights and the kind of people the left doesn't mean guns are right up there with being pro choice or pro life in terms of what separates out the two sides of America now\nYou're right you're right and when it comes to guns all these gun grabbing left to start coming for them after a mass shooting if the ... the problem where is the mass shooting at the gun show\nIn American history there are guns everywhere everyone as though on their hips there on the counters everybody's buying them everybody selling 'em there's germs and your problem why his they're not going to mass shooting in show\nYeah and and why are there are so many mass shootings in so called gun free zones as you know but people don't want to learn this lesson on the the problem as as an issue of fact they want to deal with it emotionally

I saw how to\nAnother sworn declaration today that a person was at parties in the eighties where there was drinking insects and and knew the cabinet was that these parties I mean at what point are we just put it in high school drinking and socializing\nOr in some kind of weird public trial here ... there there is no names there's no allegations of specific criminality oh yeah I Know I I I'll swear I'll swear testimony out that I went to a party a long time ago and there are people who are drinking and having premarital sex and that was happening\nOkay that's not ... you can't just prove that you're not gonna get in trouble for perjury and also doesn't prove anything they ... it was election I keep I keep running into they should be ashamed but are they have no shame and they view this as an end justifies the means such a situation and\nThat's why I Want to remind everybody right now\nWe've got to keep our eye and the ball here\nThis has never been this has never been about getting to the truth this delay is not about getting to the truth it's not about being fair to Kavanaugh or even respecting the process in any meaningful sense\nThis has been do anything to get the Democrats' way that's what this is\nAnd I'm concerned we've got a lot of time is going to pass\nBetween now and friday there was a lot of room for them to come up with something and you've seen the narrative shift oh the FBI investigation is in Folsom enough they haven't done enough um you've seen that happen but there's another component to this to\nThis is where I'm most concerned as to how I could see a vote\nFailing or the Senate not having the votes one or the other\nAnd that is this notion now that the only way that we can come back from this brink of partisan a base is if Kavanaugh becomes the sacrificial lamb if Kavanaugh is the one who has to get swept aside\nHere so that we can bring the country back together you see so that we can heal the nation\nI Want to slap myself as I say that but\nTrust me that resonates with people like flake Collins and Murkowski and you could see today some of them at least jockeying around this issue a little bit trying to position themselves\nFor maximum political benefit around Trump oh how how could he so terrible making fun of the victim\nWasn't making fun of or he was really making fun of her testimony which is a different thing a there are people who could make fun to a great extent of Dr Ford you know people will say oh she's so credible she came across as came across to me it's very strange it a little disturbed\nAnd you know the day off I'm hearing all these people that are going on in the media and saying well well I was I had a sexual assault in my past or I Know somebody who's actually saw the show I Believe Dr Ford dishes\nEthically am a ... completely on cannabis unacceptable position that will lead to monstrous outcomes something bad happened to me so I think that any time there's an allegation of that bad thing involving someone else I Believe that person or I Believe the allegations\nThat's not the way the system's supposed to work that's not the way moral judgment can be passed but this was a hysteria there was a frenzy here and it was fed so much by politics but also by the personalization of so much of this Kavanaugh versus Ford\nSituation will notice the second or the second allegation firmer mirrors and the third from sweat neck they barely even discussing that anymore\nJust ... you really can't make a case that somebody should be believe when that person isn't even sure that she knows what she's saying as we found out what they're mere as and in the third case with sweat Nick it's an intelligence test watched that interview with Julie sweating ... where she's talking about gang rape and being\nIn in community college and hanging out with high school kids and all this stuff and and if you think that she's being truthful\nDon't buy any books with big words in them anytime soon I it's just the truth if you think she's being truthful your your skills of discernment and analysis our ah our ally\nGetting to say the least but don't be fooled by what's happening with the damage here don't be fooled\nFor a second just because the narratives are collapsing just because now we can really come out now it's really safe out there to say hold on a second there is some big after some whole there's women who were lying or we believe the second and third of lying and that's just a coincidence but the first is also honest\nI have a hard time believing that now we can speak honestly and truthfully about what has been said to us in the last week in week and a half\nAnd\nWe need to understand that Democrats aren't just relying on that in order to take down Kavanaugh now it's going to be all we need bipartisanship oh\nThere's a temperament issue here as we discussed yesterday it's about it's about Kavanaugh's character you see\nThey're stuffing his background this is the latest just breaking before I came on the air the ... the Senate with Feinstein includes just you're basing themselves for the amusement of the ... cat wearing lunatic left\nThey're saying now that will be background investigation information from Kavanaugh six other background checks that's where the real mother lode is\n\nLet's talk about this and and much more aid for for nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred bucks team we have a jam packed show right back on the radio\nI died yesterday\n\nEverybody is ... and I'm here in Studio in the free them up with mark Bachmann the c._e._o. of global verification network\nYou know mark when people hear about vetting and background investigation services they may not really understand the full scope of what you do like it's not just employers it's also property owners who can use your services tell me how that works\nThat's that's on whether you think it's unfortunate behavior or not I mean whether you think it's a big deal or not that's pretty common place among\nMillions and millions of Americans and Democrats the party of bill\nClinton and Ted Kennedy all of a sudden being Puritans my gosh alcohol and like men and women mixing of parties\nThat seems to me to be just as as brazen a as a ...\nBut they're saying here that the information and he's six background investigations that have already happened that's what has to come out now also note that blog the Fords lawyers will not hand over her polygraph examination notes or her therapist notes until she gets to speak to the FBI\n[noise] here we go again why is the wise blah Z for why does she require speaking the she already gave her statement under penalty of perjury\nTo the house the Senate Judiciary committee so why does she need to give the saints she's going to give it ... if she gives a different statement to the FBI\nThen she's lying and we've got a big problem that she's in criminal jeopardy so she's not going to give a different state than the FBI so what's with this only give you information the FBI oh that's right more excuse more complaint more delay\nWhich is the name of the game which is why flakes all thing I always found out since the ... was that we should have had the vote last friday in the lake is a moron that's what we found out that's all we found out so far there that that the information that's come to light has just been\nFurther evidence that cabinet law should have gotten his vote last week when they plan to do it and this was not healing the nation at\nAll and I'm telling you they've got something else it's going to hit tomorrow [noise] they're going to put something they're they're cooking something up behind the scenes I I I don't know exactly what it is but I think it's going to be about something unrelated to sexual assault now\nThey're going to say the Kavanaugh was an alcoholic or something like that just look in his ... and oh by the way he lied about being an alcoholic the proof\nIs in the record that the public's not supposed to be able to see [noise]\nThe news radio I'm Brian shook six law enforcement officers are being treated for gunshot wounds and another officer

have responded now that we've finally\nAchieved justice and yes it is justice or judge Kavanaugh to now be on the Supreme Court oh we\nRecognize that there are other things to join our focus do we recognize that there are other ways\nTo spend our time and attention I was very pleased that last night President Trump did take a moment\nTo apologize for what was done to judge Kavanaugh in the

[noise]\nThose who step forward just serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation [noise] not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception [noise]\nWhat

presumption of innocence a has been\nSomething that is under assault here from the very beginning I mean the the the presumption of innocence was going to be collateral damage was going to be a casualty of this whole process and sure enough\nIt was saved at the last moment but but understand that it was a very close fought battle it could have gone the other way and Democrats would have had no problem in fact they would have been gleeful had it gone the other way\nWouldn't have thought twice about what had been lost in this whole process despite all of that\nKavanaugh is bending over backwards doing everything in his power to make it quite clear that he will be\nA fair and dare I say judicious judge that he will do everything that he can to continue his legacy of\nDecades of public service you know Kevin all went to Yale undergrad yellow on top of his closet both he could have gone to any one of the big fancy law firms he would've made\nPartner he'd be making easily few million dollars a year right now easily instead he's a bit of a federal judge DC circuit court of appeals to me probably makes\nOn every now and less than two hundred grand or something like that\nWhich you could say well bug you still makes a good living yeah I get it but you know he could be making millions but he didn't do that he's gone into the judiciary\nUnderstands that that's a very important role in very important service and\nThey don't want to look at his record though as a judge where he was ... really universally praise and understood to be top of his field that's something that's different here that's what brings together the different factions within the right\nKavanaugh was the ... the ... gold standard choice he was in the go all in and try and own the lips choice\nSupreme Court no no no Kavanaugh was the establishment pick Kevin ... was the guy who was doing what he could in order to at least\nBe impartial as a judge should be whenever he hears cases and they tried to ruin him\nThey tried to destroy his life destroys families destroys reputation there is no more room for anyone who calls himself a conservative sit around and say yeah you know what you know what the answer is to all this be nicer to the lives\nTake their arguments more seriously play more fair with them be a little softer and your tone with them that's just not serious anymore it's not a serious argument\nInstill the lives finally recognize that what they have been doing is no longer the way business will be done\nThat they can no longer shame and destroy with impunity we must continue to win and we must continue to push for what we know to be good and right for the country no matter\nHow much they scream no matter how much they banged on the doors that Supreme Court or mob people in restaurants or act\nLike a bunch of savages\nWe have to push forward and we have to stay United and we have to win Trump understands that\nThat said Kavanaugh's like well I'm I'm Still going to be nonpartisan is not about ideology for me so he's trying to do his part to say the right thing and to try and heal the country and so and so much as possible warmth liquid to\nArticle three of the constitution provides a judicial power Shelby vested in one Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court as an institution of law it is not a partisan or political institution [noise] the justices do

not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation [noise]\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief in every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court to be a shirt that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh speaking there I mean that is what he does what he feels that is what he believes as evidenced by everything he's done on the court\nHe was with the majority opinion of almost all the time other judges looking at the law agree with Kevin all almost all the time liberal judges conservative judges Kavanaugh interprets the law\nProperly now of course that will mean that he breaks with some progressive wish list items which is why they hate him so much but there is an underlying truths here and that is that the country is a better place with more respect\nFor the rules were there will be more respect the rule of law where every American\nWill have his rights more respected under the constitution because the judge Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court now because he's justice Kevin all\nLiberals will in fact benefit from Kavanaugh's presence on the Supreme Court they just don't realize it because they don't really want somebody calling balls and strikes when it comes to the constitution they want to ring or they want somebody who will tell them yes\nThe constitution says that thing you wanted to say even though it doesn't\nAt least Kavanaugh will say I may not like this policy I may think this leads to bad outcomes in public life for a whole bunch of reasons but\nThis is what the constitution says this is what the case law tells us and with respect to precedent and all the other\nInterpretation issues that come to mind ed I'm not going to\nGive you the decision that I think I should based upon what I Want to give you the decision based on what is the law vicious where liberal separate from conservatives this is how we differ on the Supreme Court on the constitution and what all this means Scalia\nSchool is a perfect example he he would say look I I don't I don't agree with flag burning\nYou know but that doesn't mean that I think that there shouldn't be flag burning under the law was like I don't I don't like flag burning but you you should not be made illegal you know what I mean you look at some of these\nDecisions from very consider conservatives will protect the rights of liberal even on issues that they feel very passionately about and that they do not\nBecause it's about principle right they they do not agree with the end policy for progressive is all about the final outcome it's all about you know did Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Kagan and sort of my word it's that or did you did they\nGive us the semi divine rich from these judges over the Supreme Court these unelected super legislators did they give us what we want\nAnd that's how they ... Supreme Court which is why they have such a problem with Kavanaugh um but we have entered a a very interesting period right\nNow post Kavanaugh getting through heading into the midterms\nI don't know if the Democrat psyche can really handle that the collective psyche of the ... the Democrat Party can really handle what it means\nBut I disagree with bringing the Merrick Garland piece here if you're gonna bring in America and you've got to also bring in Harry Reid a limiting the filibuster for judges\nYou got to get into well on a second Democrats decided when they had power to take it to the mat take his limit and then they wanted to play the filibuster game when they had a Supreme Court nominee and Republicans had a majority so Republicans responded by saying well if you didn't like the block when it was on you we don't like the block but it's on us\nBut more importantly to compare what has happened to judge Kavanaugh justice capital thank you\nTo Merrick Garland okay Marco and didn't get a vote no one tried to no one tried to destroy America Arlene's entire life no one tried to ruin his reputation\nYou know there's real psychological damage that has done to people from false allegations people have been as was the case and the to want to ... driven to suicide by false allegations especially when that involves false allegations of rape or sexual solved\nBecause you are an untouchable in society even your own loved ones you know friends and family may think differently if you if they believe that it's true\nI think anybody with a brain news the Capitol did not do these things certainly his own family knew he did not do these things was completely innocent of it but to compare the Merrick Garland situation to Kevin or even bring them up in the same sentence I think lacks\nJudgment I think that that is a poor context or for the overall discussion but then he made one other point which was a good one is you know a a ... I got a call balls and strikes\nThere says that the only way that this gets fixed as if the American people hold the Democrats responsible at the polls yeah\nThat is the only the only check on the mob

Islam who wants to guess how critical of of the Islamic faith the women's in gender studies professors willing to be the answer is not really at all\nSummer how women are treated better according to the class in Pakistan and they are in America I don't know how we got there but that's that's how that's how they thought you know the burqa freeze women they would say I know this is the stuff that I was subjected to college radicalized me as a conservative in a sense of being a radical conservative just means that\nYou know you like celebrating the fourth of July I have read the constitution and it and it ... and it matters to you I'm that's being a radical conservative you know somebody who ... who believes the constitution says what it says and that we all have the same rights and we don't change the law based on whether we like or don't like somebody and\nThat makes you went in today's day and age\nThat makes you a radical conservative according to the left but college was certainly a process radicalization from it that way but the grieving studies departments are churning out millions of young people who really think that they have\nSomething where someone to blame for all of their frustrations and shortcomings in life that there's there's some reason\nSome reason that is not of their own making are not up there on doing that their life is disappointing that they're not as successful or not as respected or not is loved or whatever the problem may\nBe and it has nothing to do with either one part of growing up I found very important one part of the wisdom of age is just understanding that you know it's it's hard that everybody is carrying a heavy load that everybody is waging their own battle that is typical for them\nAnd it's not supposed to be easy\nI mean I I've as it was somebody said to me once\nOr a writer colleague of mine writer friends said you know whoever told the your your job you're I think he was quoting someone I don't know who but whoever told told you that your\nGoal is to be happy life [laughter] and it's an interesting way of like the difference in being virtuous than being good and being happy happy as conditional right happy can come and go\nVirtue goodness decency honor those constants those are all in your control\nAnd to change our perception of happiness such that it's not everything's going great I'm comfortable I'm respected I Love dime revered I Am you know all those things and have it more focused around who am I what do I do every day joy make other people's lives easier and better do I\nMake a positive addition to whatever situation I'm In whether it's in the home or outside the home am I being positive for my being additive\nAh they don't but they won't teach that at school and she said what they want to teach you\nOn college campuses and what the media reinforces now when we're adults is that there are extra colonel reasons for your frustrations\nAs an American and those external region reasons now invariably how to do with white males somewhat somehow white males are now the ultimate ... we we are\nPublic enemy number one in America and there's a lot of us so obviously a lot of enemies we are the bad guys based on this underlying media narrative and once you start to put it in those terms once you were willing to speak about it in an open way you're not saying oh gosh that can't really know that is true\nThen much of what we've seen here with the whole Kavanaugh debacle and I say that about the process it's as any of you listening to show knows I was as fired up about Kavanaugh's I've been about any anything\nUm in defense of cap and all and then in absolute opposition to this obvious smear effort by the left I did everything I could I mean I was reaching out\nIt wasn't just normal day at the office for the buck man with Kavanaugh I was reaching out to colleagues across media how do we get the word out we need to make this we need to make this point we need to refute this

it is a scary time\nFor men and in response a singer songwriter named Lindsey labs Stewart out of Texas wrote a parody song of that statement I suppose we could say it's a scary time for women according to a her assessments but ah here's look she's got she's she's talented here's out some of it goes plate\nIn name only\nI Can't you do when you might end in Ninety and anger management I\nMean and again if\nYou're not you're not there any\nOkay now\nAs I said they're nice voice obviously has some talent political analysis is not one of them\nA few things you said about any people say oh buckets art and she was running okay but she's this was a parody song she's being a political point so I'm dealing with it as a function of politics and she's responding to what the president said about how it's a scary time to be a man she says things like it is or rather ... you can't\nHave the windows open when you're a woman home alone no if you live in an unsafe neighborhood I maybe maybe you feel that way but that seems a bit extreme\nI'm considering also that America is at the now the bottom end of a fifty year decline in violent crime I I think that that's a little that's a a little bit extreme but and then to say that you can't go to the bar without a chaperone\nWell I Know a lot of women and having a lot of women in my day and let them go to the bar without a chaperone\nAnd I know plenty of women who wear miniskirts all the time and or would feel free to where many screw it whenever they chose to not feel weird about it and plenty of women who if somebody slid into a GM is when someone\nYeah I'm somebody else on Twitter or you know writes them on Facebook or who would say whatever they felt like saying so why are we being told that these are all things that women can't do why make these claims that are ridiculous Clinton's\nNow that's not to say that that things don't happen\nTo women every day across the country and there aren't bad men out there who perpetrate horrible crimes with someone of of course we all know that that we're we're having we're trying to have an adult conversation here we're not having a conversation\nAbout oh you're saying that there's no this is what the left does producing search result is it a problem of course of ...\nIt's a it's a heinous crime a felony for which people are severely punished as they should be\nBut there is a hysteria and this is what I'm really\nTrying to get out with the lyrics in this song and the way that the media talks about this there's this hysteria among leftist feminists\nRape culture on campus rape culture is I mean there is no ... culture on campus rape is a is a horrible crime it's illegal in all fifty states and is prosecuted vigorously\nUh so what where is this coming from\nAnd I mean the truth is that the same identity politics to be very divisive view of day to day life the Democrat Party takes about all groups of different ethnic groups and religious groups also applies to the sexes\nIt also applies to the way that the left views the role of women or the the the ... if you will the the position of women in American society and it's\nJust not in keeping with reality and that is\nVery troubling because once again we have this problem of how do you engage with the other side when you can't agree on the underlying foundation of what is real and what is not how old are you in gauge the other side on issues like women walk\nAround dressing I mean I'm here in D.C I've lived in their ... this is this is not the Taliban version of America would walk around dressing however the water as they will showed\nAnd women are\nVery safe in this country by the numbers compared to what\nWhat would be the case in a ... a lot of other places all over the world\nAnd and there's something inherently that feels a little\nUh on just about claiming publicly in this way\nAnd it's not just the singers on this or this is common among the ... that that that men especially men who will say things like well ... that we don't care about these issues that as a slur that as a slender\nJust not true why did they go there um because quite honestly they've been fed lives and they believe these lies\nThey really do think that one in five women and sexually assaulted or because of some campus surveys that were done when that is not true unless you include unwanted looks as sexual assault which is what was included in some of those surveys or so the facts don't line up with this but facts in this and with many other things\nMake liberals uncomfortable and so they prefer to exist it as much as possible and emotion first fat free zone\nAnd Kavanaugh's whole situation has been a combination of that with all the news\nAbout recent online security breaches

storm\nDamage your argument you\nWith this place so ah the reality of the U.S ambassador position is that it's a two un is is that it doesn't really make that much difference why people are so focused on it now\nIs that Nikki Haley is an interesting political figure in the Trump orbit she's obviously female she's a half South Asian and so she has a ... you know people think of her as a minority female she is a minority female or you know she has\nMinority female or in her background or rather she is by background of minority female\nUm\nShe's also liked by the establishment people think that Nikki Haley is in that circle of Trump Administration officials who are not surprises Judy the beltway swamp types right I mean there's there's Mattis there's Nikki\nHaley um there's\nTrying to think of who else would be you know you think of who who would be in the rules are in now in any administration\nThat's going to the game you can Play Doh Kelly is chief of staff I mean there there are some people but certainly are well within what your expectations would be for the role that they have 'em but the Trump Administration is non\nTraditional and that is included a lot of nontraditional appointments but so Haley fits into that circle of people that are thought to be\nEstablishment approved a and so when she left initially when she announced her resignation there was a moment of oh my God what does this mean and as I said you I don't think it means very much at all\nI think that she served two years she's on good terms with the president and from what we know all of his chief policy folks oh that was gonna say pumped but I I I don't think pump pale would have been secretary of state in the mother minister ration but he's\nA former congressman he's a somewhat establishment figure I didn't compares great but you know he's somewhat of an established he's a Tea Party congressman I Know but still um\nBut I don't think ... this matters all that much people find it interesting because the dynamics between Trump and\nAnd and Haley and the others in his cabinet who were thought of as being\nVery Trump be whereas Nikki Haley is not but I think Trump ... is increasingly I've always thought it was a compliment but increasingly now it's really an honor effect right it's it's a title that guys being trumpeted that means is kicking button taking names so\nWhilst they focus on Nikki Haley today oh was the big story oh my gosh ...\nBecause they're soft in the GOP that Nikki\nHaley is the most likely post Trump GOP nominee now let's just pull that\nDown to earth for a moment here uh does anyone really know what the political climate is going to look like in six years never mind in in you know in in ... or in in in two years never my six answers now they got no idea\nI Am I absolutely certain Trump is going to win reelection down but I'm pretty certain\nUm but Nikki Haley as a woman\nCertainly fits into what all these political journalist like to do just come up with a narrative that interests people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different twenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation is Bill Bill the airwaves with speculation and\nYou know you'll you'll ah never have to worry about\nContent you'll have plenty of speculation is easy and cheap and so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on this but those are all I think so and so it was going to run on ... part of it is that it's fun right speculations also fun it can be interesting and just not worth all that much but they're saying that Nikki Haley may run\nI'll be honest with you I don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that you necessarily\nI'm quite as a compelling candidate because here's here's what the what did you always gotta remember in these situations\nAre side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling our side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplish in a minority you know in fact what it said about those who are either minority or female and the conservative side who achieve high office in government is that they're sellouts that their traders\nTraded of their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be a lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh and then she was a a a gender trades her which I suppose is is now he's saying [noise]\nUm but I think that uh you know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day and so everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations is speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into play quits wealth\n[noise] I'm not leaving at the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good faith effort to actually ask her to come in fact in great day in the United states and I'm proud tens and part of the team now I don't have anything he sat on where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing when\nI got an hour or six years and we've dealt with a hurricane fountain near ... shooting associating with a lot and then look how many\nYears have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years have intact and I'm a believer in her mind that I think you have to the southwest enough to know when you\nFound in the house someone else to do the jobs have\n\nThere you go pardon on good terms reputation intact didn't have some big or injure personal blow up with the ministry ration that's why she's leaving folks I I Wish I could tell you there was some crazy or story than that and if if there is also that you know but for now\nIt is what it is Nikki Haley's hadn't out\nDoesn't really matter who cares [laughter] that's my analysis\nOf it I Know a book no what do you do it uh but I I Do want to spend a little time with you on the\nMidterms because there is a a scrambling for narrative on the left and it it does tie in so much with Nikki Haley said there and her little statement which is it's a great Dane America\nThe concern I have for the Republicans go into these midterms is that things are so good right now\nKind of me so strong we are fighting massive wars taking daily casualties abroad and countries we have no hope of ever reconstructing and creating permits ability in and you know would that that's not now I Know we're still in Afghanistan but we're not losing people every day we we don't have a hundred hundred and fifty thousand troops\nServing in these countries are serving in in a war zones\nAnd overall things are really good right now\nOr the media the mainstream in his in his backyard but that can be a problem for us because people don't vote when they're happy they vote when they're upset\nThat is a concern for me I Want to I Want to address that and also just the overall narrative from the less going to these midterms that's going to come up and just a moment on the radio\nI got [noise]\n\nHow does one never missed a customer again when customers called check your email expressed to me automatically engages them with your digital content\nSimple text flyers coupons menus priceless video audio or anything else expressed to me it's much like tax\nIsn't going to convince any I don't think any moderates are centrists to who are really dying right here is you know and key in the house races you need Republicans to get some upset victories uh but yeah I don't think there's going to convince people to do that necessarily but what do you think about where we are as a country right now\nAnd what they have gone to this president along the way it is bonkers its role special counsel and the and the investigation and the the grinding machinery of this\nA special counsel bureaucracy chewing people up costing them fortunes in legal fees threatening everybody with perjury charges all of this Trump is how to do this with that Obama didn't have that Obama didn't have that for his first two years in office okay and\nAnd you look at the comparisons over people say oh inherited you know that yeah there was an economic reset from decades of bad policy when it came to housing and lending which by the way it was pushed by social justice warriors that's a whole other conversation\nBut the bank bailout everyone was at the bank bailout happened on Bush's watch tarp is what happened on a or rather the stimulus pardon me ... the stimulus is what happened on Obama's watch\nThat's what a ... which was a trillion dollars of what exactly does that do oh that's right give a lot of money away the Democrat grab bag issues and causes and and buddies and special interests\nThat's what the stimulus trillion dollars of just you know Democrats spending stuff on whatever they want to spend money on to help the economy that was your money they spent\nThe bailout of the banks occur when Trump was in office right so I'm Sorry when Bush was in office so there's a whole thing that Obama turn the economy around no everything he did actually made the ... made the slowest most painful economic recovery since the great depression\nSo this is just a rewriting of history they're engaged an end in Obama's last two years in office they were trying to excuse the weak economic growth they were trying to excuse the\nOf optimism about the corporate investing environment in this country about jobs and wages and how they were stagnant that they were coming up with anything to make Obama seemed like he was oh just so great\nAnd now the narrative of the hold together Trump has been doing a fantastic job he really has I Would love to see the Republicans stay

of an emergency\n\nWith me today I have Andrea arrogance of bubbles United Way how are you young lady I'm doing great Nick how are you good to see you and you've got the good stuff coming over documentary and so we need All right yeah\nWe are making our big push to recruit carrying positive adult role models right here in Pueblo to spend one hour week with a struggling middle school student in our United Way middle school mentoring program\nOr what are the qualifications or what do we need\nWell you just have to have the listening here you have to be a positive adult role model course pass a background check so but when we ask that you spend an hour a week with a student and one of the five middle schools that were at and that you listened that you provide that support\nInformation and advice on life skills that you can share and the hours typically around the lunch hour so if you're working individual and you can get out for lunch\nAt spend quality time we've seen that it really makes a difference in the student achievement in academics in their behavior attendance but what's harder to measure but we really see a lot of strides with is in their school engagement and our overall self esteem 'cause ... do you remember when you were in middle school\n... horrible so horrible yeah\nIt just makes me feel sick when I think about it and so so many of these kids are they just come from families that maybe they don't have support or maybe it's a single family household and they need that additional\nPositive adult role model is a little extra encourage me and it really makes a difference and it's a bond that's forged um that I think is not only benefit beneficial for the mentor and also the person doing the volunteering\nOkay well I'm thinking back eighth grade that was what the toughest three years of my life [laughter] ... yeah so you're looking for people from all walks of life yeah rug all walks of\nLife as we we are really putting a target on business people and the reason is is just people that are in the workforce but will we love retired people as well is that so they can explain and demonstrate how school help them and their specific\nJob because if you remember in fifth grade you're like what the heck does algebra happened in New York I live I still think why\nWhy I think oh I should have paid more attention in algebra I couldn't figure out how to lay this would've madly so it's really\nKind of to show the students at how school goes into future life and in their jobs and and just not only that but just life skills player you know how you become more organized the kids in the program are smart kids that's for sure you just need a little bit of\nHelp to them chewed up not yeah may maybe I give them advice on how to be more accountable responsive but these are smart kid they just need a little ... and all of you you're thinking I Know it when you open up the paper you're\nOut there thinking how can I help him ... view this is a great way to do it one hour week during the school year it's safe it's monitored and we do field trips to as well to create Bonnie this is a way that you can make a meaningful impact in our community because this is our future and you\nKnow I Know in the past you've needed more males is that still the case yeah\nWe typically need about sixty percent males and forty percent females because we we see that that typically mostly in in that's the breakout because just the\nPolitical building the green home\nMiddle perfect time to talk about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider you've all over the\nWhole city or\nThe blaze you know they need a little bit of extra help so we need a lot of men that are willing to step up and and be that positive male adult role model but of course we we use females and our gladly are able to accept them\nNow if somebody wants to do this well how do they sign up\nSo I'm going to direct them to our website blow United Way dot\nOrg slash mentor information there they can sign up they can apply and again you just have to pass a background check we do an interview with the perspective mentors just to line them up with the students that we think they'll let you have and then we do a training just to give a\nProse on and plates on how to best interact with the kid but if you can listen you can do that so it's not a tutoring program it's just that positive\nAdult role model ... which we all probably have some were in our past\nYeah if you look back you know we all know there's somebody that made a difference even outside of our parents teachers yeah church something and I still have\nMentors and if I didn't have mentors I I just can't imagine you know where my life would be so they they'll always make an impact\nWell there you go if you uh feel that in your heart again but we're not away dot org ...\nSlash mentor yet you can go on their check it out and we're happy to answer any questions as well or they can give us a call at two two five eight five eight zero as well\nUh but lots of information on on the website and we'd love to have it'd be a part of our mentors are amazing people they're all busy they're all care and and for them to donate their time is really humbling\nAnd mentors I've talked to their rewarded as well they feel great about it the hate to see the end of the school year\nDo they do so yes we really encourage if you want to make a real difference in public view the United way middle school mentoring programs the way to go\nA Judy details you can even call here will get you hooked up

which decided to go after told them six years ago when he made a fairly\nInnocuous yet stupid statement about right\n\nI certainly don't think it was worth deep six seeing a Tea Party candidate because doing so gave us Claire McCaskill\nAccording to the federal is one of the Web sites that we all read Remington research group is founder of the one thousand five hundred and fifty five likely Missouri voters survey late last week forty eight percent said they were planning to vote for the Republican candidate Josh Hawley\nSix forty six percent were planning to vote for McCaskill\nBut even though that's probably within the margin of error\nThe problem from McCaskill is that her opposition to Kavanaugh\nIs one of the deciding factor for voters to come out against her\nWhy forty nine percent are saying that it's just that it is affecting their decision only forty two percent only forty two as opposed to the forty nine said that McCaskill's opposition to Kevin all our motivating their support\nMore people are being motivated to come out and vote against Claire McCaskill because of her opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\nAs she's in a hotly contested race\nSupport for her Republican opponent has beginning to search the real clear politics poll average puts holy headed McCaskill by one point and shows that the grace has grown increasingly competitive as we get closer and closer to November\nIvy Heitkamp North Dakota same thing\nA majority of North Dakota support the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh\nHeidi Heitkamp voting against him to find yourself in a

I'll I'll put that whole that whole conversation aside I Would note she hasn't named anybody that she thinks raped her\nOther than Kavanaugh who she says she thinks raped her how could you how could you sleep at night saying that somebody might have rape you when you don't know\nHow could you do that\nShe doesn't know I assume that means that she either blacked out or she's claimed that she was drugs but then why is he bringing his name what makes her think that he was involved if she doesn't know he was involved you see what I'm saying it doesn't make any sense\nWhy is his name even coming up then because he happened to be at this party by the way I don't believe she ever even saw him at these parties I think this whole thing is a complete\nAn author I Know this is a fabrication now does she pepper and some details here or there about if she's from the area did she go to a party at some point I mean she can claim that some of this stuff might be but it's true in the Vegas and certainly not true in a criminal sense\nShe went from saying in this interview that Kavanaugh's spike the punch which how would that work\nHe spikes the punch everyone's drinking from that okay so he wants to get the girls drunk she sang right so you can take advantage of lemons but but I mean everybody's getting drunk these are high school kids it's not like the guys can be drinking this up you know is adding a little adding a little a boost to it to make a little stiffer\nOkay they're drinking punch so they can do that he can't ruin the the big bowl of punch because that means he be roofing himself and all the other guys and girls that everybody right it'd be like poisoning the only water source you have well if you have to drink from that too it's a bad idea ... story is idiotic\nDoesn't make any sense\nFabrication though that's why that's why when you get into the details at least doctor former smart to say I don't remember I don't remember all I Know is that he did this she doesn't really remember anything other than Brett Kavanaugh did this that's all she remembers\nThis woman tried to do all this other stuff but the story was too complicated it's you can't keep it straight she claims that they would show up wearing their high school uniform they're Catholic school uniform to these parties no no they ...\nI went to a a Catholic school or private school in Manhattan we used to parties and parents were gone and we drink beer and not really kegs but you know we'd get into all kinds of booze people weren't showing up wearing their uniforms that's just weird and she added that detail to make it seem authentic but that's that's wrong that doesn't ring true\nAnother detail that came up in the course of this never mind the fact that as I as I've already said she's change things from her sworn statement\nShe is telling details are telling us details that don't make sense she's saying that Brett Kavanaugh maybe kinda she's not sure raped her which is not something that a person who really believe they were raped by this person would ever say\n\nShe also graduated a few years ahead of capital she's in her twenties and she's going to parties uh Fifteen or sixteen year old high school parties no no I'm not saying it never happens but people in college don't go to the the high school parties with sophomores in high school that doesn't happen\nI was in college not long ago that would be considered strange\nAnd she's the adult these are high school can I can tell you this when I was in college I Know that every female that I was friends with that my college if they were at a party of high school kids and they thought the girls are being roof eat and raped gang raped\nThe call the police right away right away you got to remember there's a power dynamic here right a a twenty two year old has a lot more maturity and would\nBe in a much stronger position to take action or would futile much stronger position socially when they're part of you know Fifteen and sixteen year olds\nI coached high school soccer I was twenty two and my kids were Fifteen or sixteen and they thought you know I was the adult and they were a bunch of kids I wasn't going out doing keg stands with them is just on the point is it doesn't make sense she's lying\nIn an interview she gave was obvious it was a disaster anyone still believes this really turned into an intelligence test\nBecause you can't J.

I Know they're talking to mark judge now the FBI is going to go into remarked at work I didn't tell them exactly what he's already written down and just warn statement\nI don't know this woman I don't know what she's talking about this didn't happen cabinet never did this she's like basically\nThat's what you can say about Ford maybe afford Ramirez and sweat Nick ... is the one who says that maybe maybe he\nKavanaugh exposed himself during college she can't be sure but she called a lot of people to ask them what they think\nThat's not that's not something that\nInspires confidence in her telling of events is it\nCan't be sure exactly but you know it might have been him so let's try to pile on and help ruined his life that's where mirrors\nAnd then they find some roommate or doesn't like look you could find people in college I didn't like me to they were losers they were jerks but there were some of them you know they probably say oh yeah a buck was you know he was bad they say whatever to trash me if I were running for office of any one of you went to college if they could find somebody especially in a really politically contentious time if you were conservative everybody\nLoves to bash among conservatives oh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties really does\nBut I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so then it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think ... realizes that she's done in the Senate if she votes now she's done that's my impression that's my analysis I could be wrong\nMurkowski though strikes me is more\nTransactional rent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for her forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse in the\nPast so\nThat's that's part of my concern ... and then you also have this is continuing narrative in this ties into what I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch for flake you see they can't get Kevin on the rate they can't convince any normal reasonable person the Kavanaugh was of all the gang rapes or that or that there's any evidence running this because there is no evidence\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there is the approach that she has which is just whatever we can do to\nCriticize this guy or taken down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about these developments we found out overnight you lose the Donald with ... cabin all true ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualifying for someone who's been a Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need and had the island nation because there are a lot of allegations reports really are about how it is\nSo that is very relevant and the trail of himself as actively choir boy or is there much contradicted by it may sound mind college as long as people and and I go why we need an FBI and the reason why I'm calling from one\nFor like five\nMonths what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that center who wrote it was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\n\nWe need an FBI investigation that cab and all because you might have thrown ice into someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago\nThirty five years ago who can say that and not feel like a moron\nReally don't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she's a senator or she can't be that\nShe can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher nope you're up in our ...\nTotal and missile total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament and the lines of the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you you got people that hate Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and it was a front row and he's a conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitutional is and also I Believe the rule of law\nYeah that's our team\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into incident of Nineteen eighty four or whatever it was no that's not serious New York times doing a peace right now on how he was part of a\nLike party planning or something back in the day in New York Times doing that bees whoa oh gosh and he was a college kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and\nHis social life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times has been reduced to joke a disgrace times also had Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as a quote reporter when in July before any this happened she came out and said she opposes and because of the threat that he poses to civil rights\nAnd women's rights I'm short too of course that's that's that's a given you can assume that\nLook by creating this storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other than that it's\nAll about getting an escape hatch for flake and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to let's put forward we agree by the lakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for cabin office has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open the storyline you see how it goes all we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented part as an assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around them and the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing\nAll that lake takes the position of\nOh well we should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's gone up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing\nKnowing that yes you'll receive a lot of viciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger it's not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice\nReally from people but\nHe's playing the long game of I Want to get a book a book deal from Simon and Schuster or whomever you know a big big big\nHouse that's that's what flakes game last year\nOr so that's why I'm I'm concerned I I don't know how the votes will go I'm not I have zero confidence in the ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to read to you from it because\nIt is salacious that you could definitely say it is it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious dot CA but it did\nI I have noticed All right I ... I have noticed this I I Am aware of it\nAnd\nIt's the Senate Judiciary committee they released a statement from somebody that I think kind of romantic linked to sweat Nick and man oh man or their things in there essentially telling you to sweat Nick is a very disturbed and sexually\nI don't even know what the word would be you'd have to read the document I Can't read it on their family show there's some really intense stuff in there though bottom line is the woman is crazy that's that's\nThe bottom line uh and that her allegations should not be taken seriously and and you know they they they posted up some activists in Reagan Airport I see this and they're trying to harass other Republican senators in there now and I heard this line you know how many women have\nTo be assaulted before you believe women\nDish is a this is a fundamental problem with the whole left wing approach you're a collective\nVersion of justice or a collective based approach adjusted that's at the heart of all this I Want to address that when we come back and they don't talk about the mid germs and where I think this is going in terms of red wave blue wave all that stuff third our going into the

conversation now today\nToday we had a the Monday after all the Sunday shows\nAnd I look forward to what happens on the Sunday shows because we can get a couple of things in our minds if you watch the Sunday talk shows many meet the press and ABC's This week and Fox News Sunday and even the thing over at CBS\nSo that nobody watches and Jake Tapper you can kind of get an idea\nWhat the talking points are from both sides of the aisle\nAnd yesterday Lindsey Graham was doing ... duty getting out there making what I Would consider a primary ... case against the Democrats and exposing what they have done the despicable approach they took on trying to block judge Kavanaugh at all costs\nSo I'm a I'm Amazed amazed at what I saw I Lindsey Graham just lifted my heart last week when he made that\nStatement saying what a weasel the Democratic side of the aisle he turned into and how they treated judge Kavanaugh and if you watched the Sunday talk shows I was going to say that it was the greatest episode of meet the press ever\nBut I don't know if anybody will get the joke yesterday was the single best episode of meet the press that I have ever seen no nobody well it wasn't on last week because uh\nThe Ryder Cup match the golf match preempted it so that's why it was the single greatest episode\nEver but the the terminology that has shown up\nIn the language of the left when it comes to blocking judge Kavanaugh now let's go over some of the arguments that they have a brought up to block Kavanaugh one of those arguments was well he's going to ah he's going to overturn roe overturn roe v way\nThat was the first one they said we can't have that she's going to overturn roe v way and then after the meetings\nWith judge Kavanaugh and some of the testimony it seems like you know maybe he's not going to come in with a judicial prejudice and and look to overturn roe v white so they they shifted gears and then suddenly\nAt the end of the hearing process they came up with this accuser and the anonymous accuser that Dianne Feinstein at Santa for six weeks\nAnd so we said wait a minute we're going to question his character from thirty six years ago on we then discovered how many holes there were in the story of professor Ford\nAnd then over the weekend after the testimony and I was in DC last week I saw block\nOn Thursday we ran into each other the book party for a friend of ours I was in D.C to cover the or the hearing and the protests and then last week when they look like despite all the obstruction than deflection and and all the moves that were being made by the left\nThat judge Kavanaugh was going to push through and we would still have this week long investigation which everybody knew everybody and the dog knew that the Democrats who were going to complain that week\nWas not enough they started shifting the narrative and listen to your friends listen to your friends on the left who are saying they're using the phrase the wrong temperament to be a Supreme Court justice\nHe has the wrong temperament this is being said\nBy virtually every single one of the pundits it's being said by the senators the or the Congress people on the left and are bringing it up and you will hear the parrots from the left on Facebook and Twitter bringing it up he's the wrong temperament and SNL which will get into\nThat so now when after Kavanaugh and ... and everyone's saying he was yelling I'm Sorry he wasn't yelling if that's what you called yelling\nYou're ignorant\nAnd let's not forget a week and a half ago when a judge Kavanaugh was interviewed on Fox News they said oh at least two robotic he's he doesn't have a motion and then when it comes out in defends himself and his family he's called too emotional he doesn't have the right temperament\nThey're even now pulling the card if a woman had done what judge Kavanaugh dad\nShe'd be called hysterical and not the good hysterical you know the the craziest there will get into that a little bit but it got to check in with one of the buck family on the phone from Alabama Solomon checking into the evening Solomon welcome to the bucks sex and show how are you\nDoing fabulous I'm Glad

new stalk five Ninety to see us Jay\n[noise]\nI'm John Caldera we've got eight minutes of the top ... funny evening thank you for spending some time with us hey\nI'm going to do my political stuff now sorry about this you know politics is local we can't save the nation until we save Colorado\nI dedicated the last Twenty years of my life to that proposition\nAnd as the left is understood how to take over the Colorado how to do it bit by bit by building out their machinery we have to do something else [noise] we've got to counter them and we counter them\n\nBy getting involved politically we're never going to be able to match them dollar for dollar we're not going to be able to match them\nFootsteps for footstep and what I mean by that is they have so many entrenched interests on the spending side that they have not just the money to win so many of these races but they have the foot soldiers they have the unions they have the kids they have the environmentalist they have\nAll the people that can go out and knock on doors we will never have that advantage because our team we're too busy working to make the tax money that will go to help\nEverybody else so\nSince we're not on the taking side of the equation were on the go tax us side of the equation and it's\nIt's really difficult\nFor us to get politically involved we don't have time we've got we've got a life we've got kids we've got family and we make our money by ... juicing things in the private sector not by taking things from the public sector\nSo of course they have they have an incredible advantage\nWhat are we going to do about it\nWell the first thing we need to do is just one vote\nAnd I'm Amazed at how many people haven't so I've been keeping an eye on the amount of ballots that have been returned so far and so far we\nWe compare to two thousand and fourteen more ballots have been returned in Colorado why compare it to two thousand and fourteen not two thousand and sixteen well two thousand and fourteen was a midterm election the last midterm election\nSo it's the one worth looking at\nAnd back then\nRepublicans came out earlier that is Republicans have a tendency to vote earlier Democrats in unaffiliated some people call them independence tend to vote later this time around it's the opposite\nCompared to twenty fourteen there are more unaffiliated and more Democrats voting\nThan there were four years ago does that concern you concerns me it means\nFewer conservatives are voting as a proportion of voters compared to this time four years ago the last the last midterm election\nThat doesn't mean we're going to lose but it means if we don't get out and vote we're going to lose and\nThere are such important things on the ballot not just the governor's race which is crucial but the ever important state Senate you understand the check and balance to a potential governor polish good try that went on for size governor polish\nThe\nCheck and balance to that is a Republican state Senate and right now today Republicans have a lead by one vote\nThat's it one vote if they switch that one Senate seat over to the other side it means a potential governor polish could have\nA Democratic House a Democratic Senate\nAnd then him\nBy the way this is not the Democrats of yesteryear that were mostly agricultural guys no no no the days of of declaring even even Roy Romer a garden these guys in the state legislature now where Democrats are hard edge command and control\n\nProgress is there is no part of our lives they can't direct better for us than we could do for ourselves\nThat's what they think\nThat's like getting out and voting is so very crucial this year\nAs it is every year Mike Coffman is in\nThe fight of his life now he's been in fights for his life before but never before has he been by nine percentage points in the polls\nHe's been down by other percentages without that high\nWhat a shame it would be if we were to hand Nancy Pelosi control of the United States House of representatives because the people of Aurora oh the sixth congressional district just couldn't get their stuff together enough to reelect this man\n\nAnd how crazy would it be if it was the Republicans\n... ... I\nDon't think that Mike Coffman is you know Republican enough and so therefore they just didn't get out the vote\nThat's what's at stake face up to you you can you can go one way or you can go the other but just so you know\nThe control of the United States Senate the control of the future of Colorado is laying on your kitchen counter yet that ballot in when you do that vote for one oh nine trust me on this one I'm John Caldera\nBaby Casey this J.\nSprings Colorado is news dependable accurate valid [noise]\nFive Ninety Casey and Jerry yesterday\nOn my heart radio or tell your Google Assistant okay Google like five Ninety case yesterday on I heart radio all your favorite music all your favorite stations like us all three of my heart radio dry at you like it on your smart speaker news dot by Ninety KCBS Jay\nHey guys don't mind the interruption to this radio program let's talk about male performance in the bedroom a subject that millions of guys ignore but in today's demanding world you just can't if you've tried ... or other male enhance it tells that just don't work\nListen to the following important message and get your act together now you need to try not to ... the superdelegates designed to transform your performance in the bedroom once and for all what's so good about\nOxygen it's been developed any us FDA labs with the highest quality ingredients to increase blood flow fast taken inexperienced strong explosive results and there's no side effects just imagined by ... on steroids so now to find out how to get a free bottle we recommend you use Knoxville extracted thinking their partner we certainly don't\nTo find out how any by ... you know at least ... times ... ...\nWhy so yesterday\nOf course include person born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states but will include every other class of persons\nThat's right notch foreigners okay this is different than do people who are permanent residents who are green card holders there are no longer foreigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners for the purposes of this discussion\nBut it is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and there were dropping this amendment it was never there intention that this would extend to people who are\nIn the United states illegally\nAnd now this is where we get into some complexity in some difficulty because for quite a while now it has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon right if you come into America and you have a child\nThe law has been the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books is that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship\nSo if you come into America you have a child that child is this has led to some open it outright scams other system\nMost notably with the citizenship\nOr you know or a birth tourism or citizenship are scams that are run\nThere have been all stories on this we're in California in particular you have people from each day\nYou know who will fly to California and stay in a specific hotel and and the whole purpose of this is that the they're\nWhen they're you know nine months pregnant so that they give birth here that with a child that citizenship in this country and they can then go back to let's say mainland China or wherever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older\nThey already have citizenship well gee that's that's a pretty that's a pretty sweet deal isn't it but citizenship is not supposed to be a commodity that people can just sort of snatched for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it\nThan that and\nWe obviously can tell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving\nBut all of it as a citizen right all but this person to citizen people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah they're on official government business and they're abroad on behalf of the United states so it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nI'm but illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing but encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws and then they benefit from that violation\nOf law and they are a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure overrides an actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are and it's unfair to the American people\nOur government is supposed to be putting our interests ahead of the interests of those and the rest of the world who just want to be here and that means enforcing what yes I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country or another that's all it's unfair\nBut life is unfair and nation states\nAre inherently somewhat arbitrary system just like the lines on a map at separate them are generally arbitrary yes some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time and just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is\nAnd if there is no government enforcement of that than the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement of laws around immigration\nThan those laws in effect ceased to exist\nAnd then you keep working back from this and you find yourself saying whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here\nWhat Democrats really what the Democrats really want and what do they believe the fourteenth amendment says and and they clearly believe that and and ... it's not just believe that it's also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person has citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much more likely\nThat later on that person will be able to sponsor all that's right you get to sponsor family family reunification right\nSo if you if you come let's say from Honduras because that's in the news a lot right now have you come from ... to the United states you are waiting to find out if you get asylum\nYou have a ... maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status you around the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality if you\nHave that child\nIn America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically you could have family reunification migration a chain migration to bring interest the family in the oil but it was at one kid in America I Know you're already at the front of the line\nWhen it comes to the immigration system we have to think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child it's the incentive for the entire family now\nYou know the uh what was it the uh I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you the center for Immigration Studies there you go\nAbout a fifth\nOne in five and twenty fourteen seven hundred and Ninety One thousand a birth in the United states were to in immigrants whether legal or illegal and illegal immigrants counted for\nSeven point five percent which is almost three hundred thousand so in twenty four teams bleed the three hundred thousand illegal aliens had children in the United states but it's not just a three hundred thousand or so remember that's a few years ago it could be even higher now\nIt's a three hundred thousand plus then the likely sponsoring of their entire family reunification oh but maybe it's even more complicated than that\nBecause once you've had that child in this country let's say that you are here legally and you've had a child now you have a citizen child you know the Democrats are going to say oh we can't separate families\nSo forget about whether they can even sponsor the rest of the family for a for a legal immigration system\nAh forget about that right because now it's you have is just the politics and the emotional appeal\nOf oh\nOh hold on a second you already have a citizen citizen Charlotte American citizen Trump of course we can't send you back of\nCourse you can't be deported hence the phenomenon of an anchor baby I it it's essentially gaming the system not just for that individual who's obviously getting a benefit by his parents doing something that is\nA illegal right across the country is clearly it'd be being illegal aliens illegal Democrats may not want to believe it but it is true it is illegal you are in violation of law so they're getting a benefit but then they also get the additional benefit of oh wow if immigration and Customs Enforcement later tries to deport\nThe parents they're breaking up families Trump says he's gonna handles with an executive order is that the right way I mean probably not from a\nPerspective of separation of powers of the constitution there are some\nDecisions although not particularly robust ones that look at the issue of who's a who's a ... a who's a citizen subject the jurisdiction there of and there were some complexities the nineteenth century around this because of Native Americans and whether Native Americans were subject to Native American jurisdiction not not us federal jurisdiction um\nBut the courts have never really weighed in on this in a clear fashion so yes Trump's executive order on this should have get signed should he do it will clearly be challenge right away by the never Trump judiciary\nAnd quite honestly would probably be challenged regardless of whether it was even Trump who did this it's not just this is not a trumped arrangements syndrome limited issue\nBut it will get fast tracked I think to the Supreme Court and then they will have to weigh in on this and then we will find out if in fact the Supreme Court\nWants to reward people for breaking US law and make sure that there is a clear plan to change the political and demographic realities of the United states through continued loopholes in the immigration system because it benefits Democrats\nThat's we're going to find out and by the way at the Supreme Court rules against this and says that birthright citizenship is no longer or rather if you're born in this country or no longer going to be an automatic\nCitizen what does that say about the scan the Democrats have been running with a lot of Republican complicity I might add all this time\nWhat does that say about what's been going on if that is that really isn't a valid interpretation of the fourteenth amendment and of of what's currently on the books in terms of the constitution so we really so the American

our\nGift in your children's novel that one\nWas able to show during the presidential debates if she were the Democratic candidate all this being left out by the way by the\nMedia that's for a feverishly and fervently trying to cover for Elizabeth Warren some reason to the words are coming out I could be one way or the other I'm not sure which I'm going to go with that keeps happening today\nBut she released the information from her her test today right uh she has decided\nTo let the world know that her long scrutinized and many would say the bong Native American heritage\nIs now back in the headlines because the analysis reported on by the Boston Globe\nWhere the vast majority of warrants family tree is European it says that she has a date of American ancestry quote in the range of six to ten general [laughter]\nSix to ten generations ago so this is a really a non scientific\nBackground ed and heritage analysis of of Elizabeth Warren but six to ten generations ago that would mean she is getting ready for it\nBetween one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American and the Boston Globe and actually do\nThe math wrong on that one uh so I'm I'm here to to to fact check the Boston Globe's math among among many other things that we have to look at here\nAnd this was this was a truly jaw dropping moment today this this whole phenomenon because this was not some analysis that was released against Elizabeth Warren's will this wasn't a some surprise\nThat a a competing campaign or somebody else a decided to drop and make it difficult for her to get elected\nTo the contrary Elizabeth Warren took the position that this would\nBolster her claim\nI don't know which is worse here um that Elizabeth Warren is\nShow delusional she thinks that this proves her case or so tone deaf as it has to think that this will stop continue mockery of her for racial fraud I mean the hill where I work\nIn response to this ... wrote that Elizabeth Warren DNA test shows quote strong evidence of Native American ancestry but the the real headline here if I may finally be civil is it there's strong evidence that she may have had a Native American ancestor a couple of hundred years ago\nAnd since then it has been one long on on on a drop in line of white people\nIn fact if you look at the percentage that Elizabeth Warren is likely Native American compared to the general white American population she is less than average\nIn her connection to the Native American population meeting you and to me listening is if you happen to be white and an American and a lot of you or not but if you have any white an American is likely you are more Native American that Elizabeth Warren\nAnd yet here we are here\nWe are she she must have thought that this was going to give her some degree of of credibility I I don't know what she's thinking I mean ten generations ago\nThere's no realistically there's no way to know if even the ten generations ago if this is accurate and then when you when you look at the Boston Globe analysis and you start to read some of this you\nThat this is all it's all kind of have\nBeing nonsense anyway quote the this is from the Boston Globe ... the analysis of orange DNA done by Carlos Bustamante who's a professor at Stanford a really he tracks DNA Analysis via population migration\nHe quote concluded that the vast majority of warrants ancestry is European but the result strongest support the existence of an on ad mix and Native American ancestor\nA six to ten generations ago um this folks if Elizabeth Warren what this tells any normal rational person is that if Elizabeth Warren is in fact able to call herself Native American\nLiterally any white person in the country could credibly claim to be Native American\nFor professional purposes for the purposes of advancing oneself and therefore it would no longer even matter if you call yourself [noise] Native American it would no longer make any difference\nIf you consider yourself to be in America's everybody's every but we're all Native American by the standard is\nCompletely nuts\nIt's just completely nuts and the fact that Trump was able to get so in her head by calling her Pocahontas as we know he does time and time again the fact that Trump has managed to\nTo force this incredible uh on for stare on on her part\nIs just astonishing really is this is somebody that is getting in the top\nFour or five of early support from the Democrats for running for\nPresident and most of the polls that I've seen in fact as big CNN pull out where I think she came in for third or fourth place\nUm and and when you look at this analysis when you look at what's going on here uh eat each amazing\nTo me that that anybody could read this and this is what's so crazy folks people in the media took this as evidence that she was right [laughter] I mean she's\nShe's like one one thousand Native American may be and it's not even really Native American it's based on population migration from South of the border\nInto the United states so she doesn't even ... it's not even clear that that this one one thousand or one sixty fourth or whatever it is is truly from a Native American tribes and yet\nPeople in the media were things juicy proved that Trump is wrong Trump needs to pay up\nNow what what\nAre they had desperate I think there's a little panic right now on the left because they realize oh my gosh\nElizabeth Warren has completely clown herself here I mean it just made a complete mess of things and so there that the media has\nTo go even further and they have to somehow pretend like\nYeah that's right you prove that that's crazy she didn't prove anything and everyone knows it\nBut well what else are they going to do I mean this is\nA this is telling us that that that pigs are flying folks I mean this is complete detachment from reality by the lips\nEighties bonkers\nAnd on this notion even that that she has any Native American ancestry let me just give you this is from this post a this analysis in the Boston Globe quote detecting DNA for Native Americans\nIs particularly tricky because there was an absence of

out a video today about all this stuff ah Elizabeth Warren decided that the best thing for her to do would be to actually create some kind of a a little propaganda film for herself\nWhere she would have different members of her family and they're different people all involved in this and I\nFeel I feel like there should be some degree of\nOf embarrassment here\nOr there should be some oh my gosh what am I doing but then again when you when you look at what's really happening on ... across the board right now with with the media and with the effort to take down Trump\nAnything is acceptable as long as it is for the cause I mean anything is going to be considered okay here as long as it is a evidence or useful in the anti Trump cause\nI just I I've reached a kind of a new a new level here and a new degree of understanding of just where the media is taking all this stuff and and what they're willing to do and what they're willing to put the American people through a in terms of propaganda and and the whys and\nThere's no way that a normal person could have read that Boston Globe report today\nAnd come away from it with anything other than wow that is a massive mistake that Warren has made here and she's clearly not Native American she never should have claimed to be Native American there's nothing about her\nThat justifies this notion of being Native American and yet you know all I see right now on the on the front page of CNN here's a perfect example\nI see nothing in their main headlines is all about the Saudi guy got which we'll talk more about your mark show you later but\nNothing about that you go down one two three four five six seven\nEight eight stories down the CNN front page right now and you get quote Warren's DNA never mattered Trump\nI how how Trump's fault in one world is this is the takeaway here that Trump isn't a you know accepting her DNA results or something\nThese people are insane they really are I ordered it just impossible for them to be a ... embarrassed here's another eat another version Huffington Post\nTrump denies this is their top story about this Trump denies\nMaking charity pledged tied to Elizabeth Warren DNA test Tron said and was it was very specific Trump said that if she makes it through\nThe primaries and is the Democrat and now the knee and then and then she proves that she as Native American heritage in that case will get a million dollars for favorite charity so that's what he said okay he denies what they're saying he show which is he would just give her a million dollars if you proved Native American\nAnd not even is not the point because if she Native American everybody's Native American and anyone\nWho's trying to be honest anybody who's looking at this from the perspective of I Would like to really present the facts and and get to the truth here would automatically\nUnderstand I vicious just pathetic eat is\nAbsolute nonsense that I'm seeing here from all these different all these different sources the way that they're covering this I mean they're they're trying so hard to actually\nCover is the right word because they're really covering for Warren and this is because they think happened today is uh that would they thing happened today is that she's no longer really going to be a serious contender for twenty twenty this is laughable she's a clown she's a joke\nShe's a joke she should be at least\nHere's ABC News which is supposed to be unbiased Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results on Native American ancestry a Trump says quote who cares\nThat's their headline that's the headline to\nSee this is a perfect case of media bias at work they think that they're progressive great hope for twenty twenty is in jeopardy right now because of her own just bone headed stupidity I mean this is just on cinco de dum on think of lead them\nThere are no she was hired through affirmative action that's why she did this because there was a huge career boosts all through her career\nAnd it's a way of getting through the admissions process we're getting to the hiring process much more easily if I applied to Harvard where she was a law professor which is an embarrassment to Harvard by the way ... should be embarrassed and I said that I was African American\nPeople would rightly think that that was disgusting\nAnd I would be roundly criticized for that\nAnd I think that that's that's fair that's true that's accurate I not African American and and it's a dishonest thing and it would be a dishonest thing for me to claim that I was African American okay but why is that\nA terrible thing deserving of appropriate ... why is that something that we can all agree the media would get so upset about and Elizabeth Warren doing the exact same thing with Native American ancestry 'cause I could clean one percent African and I'm American or an African American\nLives with one of the exact same thing they're willing to try to excuse they're trying to find some way to tell us all it's not really of it and then either didn't matter or it's not true or she is native of the craziest history is Native American\nI mean no no serious person takes that should take that perspective but lots of media outlets are I mean I mean the biggest ones folks I mean the biggest ones the same ones that ... that treated the cabin on allegations that fact\nWithout any evidence those same media outlets now oh surprise surprise are acting like yeah she's she's proven or case here she's clearly she's clearly Native American not nothing to nothing to point out beyond that\nThe media should be oh show deeply embarrassed all this but\nAs we know they're not they are running interference they're active is they have chosen a side here and right now they're gal\nIs in some trouble so what\nAre they doing are they being a fact\nFinder so they speaking truth to power are they doing the best analysis and report and they can no of course not they're throwing up smokescreen even if they're flimsy even if they know that they won't withstand scrutiny they're doing everything that they tend\nTo give her either a a little bit of wiggle room to get out of this jam she's put herself in or just to to delay the full force and fury of the news cycle against her and and hope that something else comes up tomorrow\nAnd that's what they're trying to do here that's what the that's what the real plan is so I Would just note that whenever Trump called them fake news and they get so upset maybe they should just stop being fake news and then he won't call them anymore\nAnd then you also have just Trump's instinctual political brilliance here by calling was worn out and not being afraid to use the word Pocahontas or the name Pocahontas not being afraid to go where people say oh you can't do that\nHe has exposed her for a pathetic phoning in a fraud absolute fraud on the radio on\nDot com [noise]\n\nDo you have something you want to say but few you

media and to also or as a little more shall we say willing to take a a point of view\nThat would be well received by academia and the media on a whole bunch of things on I've noticed is before generals started to get very political and journals like we love is this tremendous I have no idea I'm just saying that I'm aware of this as a phenomenon of that\nFor example a lot of the stuff that came out of a general portray as I was not surprised by it all\n'cause I had known for a long time that he was a a a guy who was seeking out the media and very much\nTrying for his own purposes to to create this narrative of portray us as the the greatest military might have a generation I Would I Would just point out that before\nEven are being brought low by the extramarital affair and the woman and the classified information that he didn't ... you know all of a sudden you already know about and he had to plead guilty and pleaded guilty\nOr you know he he was credited with fixing Iraq which yes the surge work but it was really are a hundred and fifty thousand troops and people that were on the front lines fixture rock but his strategy was successful there but there were some very important ingredients that were in place for that strategy to work\nI Would note that strategy that he tried in Afghanistan\nDid not work was not working and was never going to work\nAnd he was not really willing to hear about how that was the case\nSo while I I think on the one hand you know he gets all of this credit for Iraq well if he gets all his credit for Iraq we also have to look and see the situation in Afghanistan and understand that he's not ... was not this\nUh men beyond reproach when it came to his ... certainly not beyond reproach period but also when it came to this rather so that's much more of saying I Need to do a little more\nI Need a little more analysis of what's going on here with or without ... that caught me off guard because I've heard so much\nPositive stuff about matters for so long and maybe he just rub the present the wrong way recently and he just wanted to comment Democrat I also this kind of funny that the president\nUses calling somebody a Democrat as kind of a a little sly or you know\n... you know as ed guys kind of a Democrat you know it's like when I say my uh my ... my guys okay it's kind of a communist\nSo Trump says he's kind of a Democrat he also said that you know that Trump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is this falls into that category\nOf oh my gosh the palace intrigue here you know we we we need to we need to make sure that we run all these stories about how Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this stuff about how Trump is you know\nUnable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have the right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love these White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to hear a lot about a so then I take a step back then I say hold on a minute\nGiven what we know about all the different leagues and all the people that are in the White House including Republicans\nWho are holdovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party people that are not on board with Trump it all we know that there's somebody right now who roads\nIf you if you believe in New York Times and I don't take that for granted\nBut if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now\nWho wrote an op ed effectively saying that we're working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president and to go to these\nIf you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy wrote this editorial we never found by the way the uh non editorial as we never found out of this guy was the anonymous\nEditorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust everybody in the White House of course the ... to do that and that's also why I give him more leeway than I Would then other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying here are that's\nConvenient not self justifying ah but I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them\nAnd if your Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition but the people that are ostensibly supposed to be on your side of the fence people who are ... opposed to be Republicans helping you out you know your your battle buddies so to speak and how many of them have become Turner coats on it\nHow many Republicans have we seen including people with some pretty decent recognition within party circled I mean you're talking about like Bill Kristol the Weekly Standard and conservatives right wing or whatever you want to call them that have openly said yeah I'm actually just not even opposing trumpeting Moore I'm a Democrat\nIn that kind of an environment which is the environment President Trump is in\nI think it would be in Shane\nFor the president's a trust everybody in the White House of course he doesn't trust ever in the White House this reminds me of some of the politicians that I've I've been able to interview in the last few months and\nI Love when they do the you know OK off the record and I'm like you're not telling me that he was really some of them you know there are telling you what I mean it's really off the record what they're doing is saying off the record to create the\nFacade of you know I'm really giving you some access and inside here and I'm trying to build this report\nAnd then they say things that if I were to violate off the record which I never would but if I were to violate off the record it would make them look even better you know they're like off the record\nI volunteered at a soup kitchen last weekend and save some puppies from a burning building is that really does that does that really has to be off the record senator so and so I guess\nSo ah and then you know the the one that really contentious exchange the really contentious exchange that Trump had here with Leslie stall in this interview uh had to do with immigration because I think that is the one area where the left\nAnd the the media allies that they have have felt like they've been in the strongest position a since the summer to just just pound Trump on this and what I think it's so so fascinating here is that they stole the descent and they always do well it's your policy\nIt's your policy to separate parents from children the border you did it it's on you it's your fault\nAnd Trump's has but no it's the law and I don't think\nThat they even I don't think he's media critics even really understand that to say that it's\nThe law is to say that it's actually the Congress that does bear some of if not the lion's share of the responsibility for this whole situation that that that that the Congress is either a napped or cowardly or for whatever reason just unwilling to do what they're supposed to do in these circumstances\nWhich is to find a way to adjust a law\nThat it's a bad law or to repeal it entirely isn't really the president's role I mean this is how much damage I think Obama did to the rule of law as a concept it became normal during the Obama administration for him when he felt\nFrustrated with Congress ... articles er Cox an editor what am I correct\nOr he would go around them and do this whole executive order routine which was an abuse of executive orders because what he was just doing was usurping the legislative branches authority and pretending the laws were what he wanted them to be and saying well it's just about enforcement it's not just about enforcement when you don't for something at all\nIt's not just about enforcement when you exempt an entire class of people that are explicitly not exempted by Congress\nAnd I think that's\nPart of this that just immediately that the the press puts aside for pushes aside and they really assume I mean they really thought that they would uh they would be in a place where\nTrump and the Republicans would just get hammered on immigration they would be or they would be just crushed because of what I've been going on at the border and I think that they miscalculated\nThat for a lot of Americans enough is enough they don't really want to keep being told that you know immigrants or do jobs or whatever the legal ... folks not immigrants illegal immigrants do the jobs Americans won't do that illegal immigrants are nothing but a net positive for the economy\nAnd they would like to have some reestablish mental the rule of law when it comes to the border and I know that Trump has and build the wall yet and there's a lot of stuff that remains a remains to be done and I have a lot of of concerns or whether it will even happen especially if the Democrats take the house but\nAll this on this issue of the body can tell lovely so she just wants to oh the parents being separated from their children\nHappened under Obama it's a law that still on the books that was the law when Obama was an office and oh by the way the

in the game that you should be able to show on a federal income tax return that you paid I don't know a dollar\nA hundred bucks a thousand dollars I don't care you know I I don't know why why do why because I was\nI was on our work day thing today putting in some time for vacation which I never taking my end up getting screwed at the end of the year so I was putting in for some vacation time you know his notifications that I had not a downloaded my PBS for my patients\nSo it was I was waiting for a meeting to start earlier at noon today I just quickly downloaded a few of them and I looked at the last piece lip and I looked\nOver there to the federal withholding year to date\nAnd then I put the automatic a E D on to restart my heart if everybody had to pay federal income taxes have to show that you were actual tax payer then and only then would you get the vote\nThat we can't do that because well that's that's I was like a poll tax or something that's that's that's like a poll cat or a poll tax or a ... something like a poll dancer you make those poll dancers declare all the dollar bills get stuck in their G strings before they can vote yeah yeah I don't I wouldn't mind that\n\nIt's better than having dummies book is better than having people that do you mean sometimes\nNow if you can show that you don't pay any income tax because what you had enough right off because you lost your button the market that you lost your button and investment or something else I Would I Would accept that to\nJust stop and think about\nThink about how differently elections would be I'm not saying you have to own property not seen you have to own any personal property any real estate I'm just saying that you have to have done something that shows that you pay income tax\nNow what about the elderly what about somebody's on Social Security well guess what\nPeople are going to be careful here because some people collect Social Security and they never paid into the system but if you can show that you paid into the system as a wage earner somewhere or that some point you pay income taxes maybe you're retired now I'll give you a caviar I'll give you an exemption for that to let you vote\nBut just thinking about how differently it would be if we require people to have skin in the game before you could go vote for your city council your county commissioner your dog catcher or your US Senator\nBut now I mean I mean we done that individual income taxes with the federal government single biggest revenue source\nIn the fiscal you're twenty eight team which in September thirty the individual income taxes is expected to bring in roughly one point seven trillion dollars or about half of all federal revenues according to the CDO\nBloomberg looked into the two thousand sixty individual returns data in detail for some additional insight the top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes thirty seven percent than the bottom Ninety percent combined\nSo the top one percent\nPaid thirty seven percent of all federal income tax the bottom Ninety percent combined only paid thirty percent of all we can fix the top fifty percent of all taxpayers paid Ninety seven percent of all total individual income taxes\nYou're carrying the wait for all\nThe other the goose at some point gets tired the goose just keeps laying in laying in laying in the looks around

bipartisan reluctance to tackle entitlement changes but go\nA bipartisan reluctant mini both Democrats and Republicans don't want to touch the Republicans Democrats both want to kick the can down the road in fact they kicked the can so far down the road I don't I don't know if you can't even exist anymore\nIn the popularity of those programs though hopefully at some point here will get serious about this we haven't found yet\nAnd it would appear if you kind of look at the chilies that divided government might actually yield to entitlement reform or at least make it easier\nWhen we had that opportunity during the Obama years I talk about a number of times I Would have been a perfect time to do it think of Reagan and Tip O'Neill coming together in the early eighties raise the age for Social Security it took it out of the political arena and made it possible for it to be a successful [noise]\nThat's what we had the chance to do during the Obama years when we had divided government for section is eight years\nSo unfortunately it was not a tree\nAnd it's not going to be a chi I'm convinced that it will never be achieved until there is some sort of a financial calamity nothing's

that we do not have people show up\nAnd just stay if we\nHave those yes we open borders state the Democrats are planning to demagogue this issue they are going to use this to try and get their base fired up they're going to try to use this to create this sense of a\nMoral separation between the Trump Administration and the Democrat Party and between the Republicans who support Trump on this issue and the Democrats\nAnd is very likely that these individuals who are going to show up at the border will\nEnd up in the interior of the United states ah they will be processed but if they claim asylum if they turned themselves in and they claim asylum they are going to get a hearing hearing will be delayed so you'll have a ... another wave in another wave\nWhat happens when you have a law that is not enforced what happens\nWhen the state has decided their actions that are bad but there are no consequences for that bad behavior what we're seeing this happen right now\nIt is so very easy for Democrats particularly well off connected coastal elite Democrats who don't compete with illegal immigrants for jobs who don't have to worry about illegal immigrants uh and draining\nResources from over already overcrowded public schools public schools that are attended by Americans of all ethnic backgrounds of all religions\nThey don't have to worry about that doesn't affect them in fact\nThey view it as nothing but win win by being essentially for open borders from Latin America at least in this country to Democrats get to feel morally superior\nThey get to achieve power and perhaps even eventually\nDefeat the Republican Party for ever by changing the demographics of this country such that there'll be a majority\nOf voters built in for always and and forever for the foreseeable future least who vote Democrat\nBecause they know that immigrants particularly that all of the people well [laughter] the illegal immigrants they're not supposed to vote for members who really knows what's happening there uh but but immigrants in general uh tend to vote Democrat and\nPeople who come to the country and have a greater need for all kinds of government services are obviously going to vote for the party of big government the party of the state and state isn't that the Democrats\nNow why is it a bad thing for the president to say enough stopped we can't keep doing this the answers to it it's not\nBut they won't ever tell you the Democrats the media when they set up this problem they won't act like there are two sides to it they're not going to present this as hey\nWe understand is a very difficult problem uh this is how we come down on this and we would like the president to take the falling actions no they want to point fingers and screamed racist and they want photos of crying children being separated from parents they want photos of\nPeople looking hopeless and indigent being told by immigrations and Customs Enforcement or being told by border patrol in this case you know you're you're now going to be taken into custody\nAnd they hope to make this an emotional issue\nIf it's really that emotional for them why don't they just make the case that the imagery makes for them which is well I guess we should just taken everyone\nAnd everybody everybody who has been waiting in line for years has been going through the legal process and it was respected our laws are many people who are still waiting to get into this country and who have respected our laws along I I guess they're just Trump's they don't have you and MSNBC CNN New York\nTimes Washington Post in their corner so they don't count this is very very destructive and it's also ultimately an issue of sovereignty\nIf the United states cannot determine who comes here under what circumstances than it was just a matter of time before the United states ceases to exist as a\nPolicy we will be in different countries different political union if we don't control who comes in who goes you cannot have open borders and a welfare state I think the answers are really the truth is you can't have open borders and state\nYou have something else I don't know what it is no other country in the world allows is no other country in the world takes in a million people and make them legal and God Bless him welcome to America legal citizens year in and you're at a million a year I'm Sorry legal permanent residents and citizens a million a year\nSo a lot every year working in a million through our legal process\nAnd when when Trump says well for security purposes we're gonna take refugees Middle East down from I think something like fifty thousand to thirty thousand\nOh my gosh he's like a tell all the ... he's a monster\nWell hold on a second we're already taking in a million a year are we allowed to discuss that number changing can the number only go in one direction can only get larger\nThis is also why yes we do need a wall because it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having first of all we have a Democrat president I can do anything and if we have Trump even an office for if we're lucky the next six years\nTo try and stem the tide of current migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall\nDemocrats don't want it though because Wal\nFirst off would prove its utility very quickly and then they do look foolish or walls don't work no pretty sure walls work\nYou know if you're if you're going to walk on your neighbors' property and there's nothing there that's pretty easy for going to walk her neighbors' property and has a ten foot cement wall things just got a little harder you may think twice about walking out of their property and trespassing right this couldn't be any more straightforward but they said oh walls don't work and works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border\nFence they're absolutely works so why wouldn't workouts where all they don't have any answers for you\nThey just don't want to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works\nAnd they're they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down\nThis is one area where Trump has an on look he has an on fulfilled promise now as to who's\nBehind this march and who's\nPulling the strings here I Know there's a lot of theories out there I Know I I don't know\nBut I Do know that this is not a coincidence that you have the largest of these migrant caravans that I that I Know of\nJust a couple of weeks before the midterm elections on the way the border this allows the media to play the emotional manipulation game this allows them to forget about the fact that the economy is incredibly strong to forget about the fact that all their\nPredictions about economic calamity because of Trump and all the things that they've said twenty Fifth Amendment he has\nTo be removed 'cause he's crazy Russia collusion ... the mainstream media has wasted over a year the American people's time\nOn this fantasy that Trump colluded with Russia worse than a ... it's a ... it's a plot that was put into motion by anti Trump elements in our own government to undermine the ... the United states\nThey wasted a year of our time on this year and a half of our times it's insane is absolutely insane but\nThey can get enough people at the border looking sad looking hopeless take lots of photos of lots of videos and talk about how heartless Trump is for enforcing the law that was the law in the books during the Obama administration about how the safety of all involved and also yes as a deterrent\nYou separate people from their children at the border you should reunite them but this is the process that they have had\nAnd if they do this again another Trump and his regime change the way that\nThey're going to do it because the outcry originally but if there's any separation whatsoever even a temporary separation I mean even a matter of hours we're going to be told that it's heartless it's cruel it's\n... the law it's a terrible idea\nI think people are waking up Democrats have played their hand poorly in the last three months two months\nThey have been showing a side of themselves that is the truth but as one that they're usually more adept at hiding because the left is in fact the political wing of the mob mentality\nOf mobs in the streets of mobs in restaurants of kicking women at a pro life march

I think that's fair what the heck is he talking\nAbout democracy that you know we were going to hand or children ... what does that mean\nThis is my favorite question to ask people on the left his what what are you really saying what does that mean how is it in power were about to have a big election and a lot of people are going to vote one way and a lot of people are going to one another way what what is the peril democracies in right now this is like when people say oh the first amendment is under threat by Trump how\nBecause he uses the first amendment do we ever get to hear an explanation of this is just rhetoric it's just empty it offers nothing it tells you nothing just democracy is not a spectator sport gee that's brilliant maybe you could put that on a mug and give it to somebody\n\nWhere do we find these Democrats\nPoor show sanctimonious so full of demagoguery and don't add anything to conversation there are interesting liberals out there they're fascinating left it there are people you can talk to I I Know people were anarchist and I love talking to you I Know people that have all kinds of really interesting belief systems in\nAt least it's worth engaging you learn something but the the marquee Democrats\nThese days it's just all pitiful it's all nonsense\nBooker and Warren and Sanders and bite in none of them have anti any intellectual heft whatsoever

why there's such a desperation and why they're being violent either attacking people either hurting people\nBecause they've got nothing\nI mean they have the usual slogans and the class warfare and all that but I mean in terms of candidates in terms of a bench\nKamala Harris I see here is is thinking about uh giving American families\nYou know five hundred dollars a month you're going to hear more about I think universal basic incoming are actually trying it now in a a drawing in a city in California right they're pushing for it out there\nThey have no new ideas have nothing to tell people about that can get them excited all the news get people angry by telling them how terrible and awful or the Republicans are\nI think there are also in a bit of shock and this is where I'll talk to you a somewhat about the the Kavanaugh effect which is very very real these senators\n[noise]\n\nThere's one question on the\nDoes the country want to put a check on Donald Trump\nDo we want to put a check on Trump is\nDo we want to repudiate it or do we want to validated because should the Republicans\nMaintain majority control in the house should they maintain majority control in the Senate president will not only be unchecked\nHe will be emboldened and at the core what he's doing is stoking hold civil war in this country ... the American people use that President in the history of the country who makes new preach about being the leader of the American people here the leader\nIn the theater\nMSNBC political analysis of such crash see Schmidt\nIs among the very worst we'll talk more about it he's going to get another parents later the show he does the dumbest stuff on TV so that means that you know fun to use them for commentary purposes they put them on TV a lot of MSNBC though\nWhat are you saying isn't true by the way what he's saying is is not accurate I maybe thinks he's being kind of ... or something but it's not just trumpets on the ballot and in fact what we're seeing is that it is not a the Republicans are not\nTreating it as old as only Trump on the ballot first of all every single congressional election has its own idiosyncrasies and realities and a media markets that should you think a guy that ran a very unsuccessful McCain presidential campaign should should know that out\nBut beyond that there's a there's a clear dynamic that has unfolded in the last couple of weeks last few weeks that could change this election much how you got it right now and in fact I spoke to\nI'll tell you I I had a I had a chat with a Lindsey Graham last night spoken for about twenty minutes we sat down we're over Fox and I was I was up Lindsey we weren't off the record but I was giving him a little bit of what I think's going to he was give me a little bit of what do you think's going on and here's the bottom line\nThe cabinet effect is very real Lindsey certainly knows that because he had his proudest moment I think ever in the Senate defending Kavanaugh\nBut here's what's happening and the reason that this is trending toward the Republicans at this stage of the game you know Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local elections\nRather uh the state and and congressional level of healthcare you don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging his health care health care health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling shows that that actually for the people were going to vote that matters to them\nRepublicans do have had a gift recently\nAnd what you see is that the Kavanaugh effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake is that's not gonna fly that's not going to work\nUm the dynamic of this playing out right now is the uh the\nDynamics playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamic and I think it's really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the needy because they're all they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away\nAnd it is that in a elections that are in states where it's kind of a ... a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's a little bit of a\nOf a close circle all across the board they want people to come and speak\nAbout the cabinet issue what Lindsey Graham to go and speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nSo in very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting and Trump's getting the base fired up he's going to get them to show up at the polls are great\nBut in states where it's a closer call or it's a little more purple where there you're going to have the Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did a Kavanaugh you can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not\nBeing a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any any more authority now already have all the lives the American people and cabinet could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their\nThink about what that what really happened they thought\nThat they would stop the Supreme Court seat from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nFor just going thermonuclear to try to stop it just due to a scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is dating anticipate that in a lot of close fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women\nAre scary is about what happened to Capitol furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist\nYou already we're going to vote and you hate Trump doesn't matter but if you're somebody was like well you know sometimes I I'm a little bit you know ... with some of what Trump is dawn ... but you're you're a a Republican woman\nAnd you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future this country going forward a lot of them are absolutely\nFired up about this and that could be the game changer it could be the enthusiasm among center right wing in suburban districts that makes this house contest it's going to be down to the wire\nThis is going to be really close I think could still go to the Republicans oh that would feel like a miracle but it could still\nHappen and\nIt's going to be because if Kavanaugh so folks that fight that we had to defend Kavanaugh\nWas critical [noise]\nGot a couple of it in my

if you're going to show evidence of this you would have to also most likely be willing to say where can I say what it is which means you're going to expose very likely how how you got it [noise]\nAh so I I don't know I don't know what they've got quite yet um but I Do think that there is a very real\nPossibility here that the Saudis are I'm sure they're going to suffer some consequences but they're gonna probably live to fight another day diplomatically on this one 'cause they're going to say that it's just something that happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and ah there'll be better in the future or something like that\nAnd got to remember the Saudis\nAre in the region are pretty important player for us play a clip sex as secretary of state Pompeo again\nTitle for the Trump warning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we do have some understanding of the ... which one we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to\nIncidents rounding up I think it's worse for the number two we have long said neither do too long relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nThat continue to be in for the kind of terrorism\nTested it with the two holy sites\nForeign she's you\nKnow why is the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nIt's an important ally not something that we want to just discount just fly off the handle decide that we're going to try and\nMake some big statement here there are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can make all of at our problem I Know that there's symbolism ear to journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent was in this country not the same as being a citizen but\nHe definitely had very real ties to America this was this happened on foreign soil however\nAnd so the people that are calling for an investigation I think just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation we have no basis certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis for sending any kind of investigative team and last\nOne the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish ditch\nTurkish sovereignty or I mean it's on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity added into what would already be an investigation that is highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get it how we get it but if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were\nBrought along kinda riding shotgun so to speak vice president Pence however is saying that there will be consequences political ten oh I can tell you\n\nIt was mentally\nIll I began\nHim who will be on\nThere will be consequences the vice president says notice that people are pretty pretty thin on details of what those consequences would\nBe and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response which would be both overt covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here\nAnd what would happen from a major fracture in the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want to major break with the Saudis um the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually\nA revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes on in that country and representation in Saudi Arabia for look just remember what happened with the Arab Spring with at all it's going to be great in Egypt\nThey're going to elect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women who go to school at all these ... which I mean that was happening in Egypt beforehand but you know what I mean is going to be a really big step forward\nAnd then the Muslim Brotherhood came into power let me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and\nI Would offer to you probably much more hard line Islamist than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the clerics that are allowed to preach in Saudi ...\nYou're right now only do so with the acceptance and the and he said so of the government if you actually had the top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to\nUh I Will be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario is one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship with them is because the worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenario that the government is overthrown in either of those places and Pakistan\nBecause you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia\nWe have very few powerful military allies left in the middle east is dwindling we've Israel\nAnd then\nIt starts to get pretty thin Jordan is a good ally but it's a small country not but not for the wealthier powerful one of the Turks are increasingly Islam ... they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East\nSaudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there Egypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems are and you look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping the place doesn't collapse into some kind of ethnic\nCivil war and you got it wrong clearly is not really fond of the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government\nBecause it would be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say we want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be\nA sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh\nGetting shifted around and one way or another getting stopped ... whatever they they end up doing\nHow these these are major consequences these are major consequences and then you have to look at the other side of this which is the people who are the loudest voices on this issue many of them the

is\nThe F. B. a seal you ask for a miracle I bring you the F.\nB. I.\nC. and get that one but not really it's it's true that Rosenstein has somehow managed to stay in this role and well I think it's because he knows that the hash\nTag resistance and Trump knows is to just not worth getting rid of them the ... resistance would call them sleep late and utterly freak out if in fact there was a a a a removal of Rosenstein from his duties\nBut some people don't care you got the chairman of the Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows he is calling on Rosenstein to step down at a ... a deputy attorney general because lawmakers are looking into reports about\nHow roads and so I Want to talk of all wearing a wire to record President Trump you know I really do believe that if when I was a little a little a little nobody CIA analyst\nIf I had said that I was going to wear a wire to try and trap just even the CIA director I I think I Would have been a squirt it out of the building bicycles by armed security I think they would have been like okay you're ... if I said that in a meeting in front of people\nBut for the deputy attorney general to say it and I've gone back and forth on this I don't I don't think he was kidding\nI think that became the excuse but the more I thought about it I'm not sure what the latest if you're like ... two weeks ago he said he was kidding yeah but I thought about it more I don't know like I wasn't there that's all I can do is base it on the things that I've heard\nBut you know Rosenstein or has he look he's an Obama administration hold over and he's clearly very\nTight with the DEA OJ bureaucracy and the bureaucracy protects itself but that's\nWhy I'm Mark meadows is finally had enough here's with Fox News reports about meadows of the Freedom Caucus he says that he made the comments about Rosenstein stepping down\nAs James Baker the FBI's former top lawyer was questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill earlier today about Rosenstein is reported comments as well as other decisions made by the bureau meadows criticize Rosenstein for not accepting a reason imitation of testified before the house Judiciary Committee about the record a reported comments\n[noise] you know roses and there should be accountability there should be accountability for those people should not uh people should not be able to do and\nSay whatever they want in a senior government role like that just because getting rid of them might feel kind of messy and that's not the only deep states kind of a deep state updates the deep state store I wanted to tell you about uh you have\nA\nThis treasury employee who is charged with leaking financial fence and reports on Trump team people she was apparently\nArrested with a flash drive in hand here's a quote from Fox the top Treasury Department employee was charged with leaking confidential financial documents pertaining to former Trump officials was apprehended the previous even with a flash drive in Tennessee allegedly ... information\nIn her hand oh my gosh caught red handed or flash handed\nWent nuts week this week but the dramatic arrest late late Tuesday came on the heels of other high profile leak related prosecutions of the administration which has pledged to go on the offensive against leakers the presidents have called traders and cowards\nAre so this is not only Mayflower Edwards who is a senior official at the financial crimes enforcement network she gave a reporter bank reports allegedly documenting several suspicious financial transactions\nVicious show dirty as as I've been telling you I really want to understand this isn't leaking information that is necessarily accurate or even meaningful this is leaking rumors in a sense that the federal government has on hand that they can look\nMothers against drunk driving support victims of drunk driving drunk driving and underage drinking at no charge card twenty four victim helpline at eight seven seven mad help or visit mad dot org that's an ADD dot O.

die how they're going to pick that\nIs going to be funny or all sad so\nBut you didn't watch it I don't care I really don't care and I don't know what I mean I Believe the reason why why have you in here so I don't have to we'll have to watch it I Know I got a lot to do a lot of movies or watch\nLike the oath of okay that's a\nLittle back story here so the writer director and star is seems barren holds you've seen it before it kind of a good character comedy actor and this is his debut as a director it's his baby and he wrote it in part because he was at his own Thanksgiving dinner one time after the election\nAnd they were fighting and they were basically all left of center so they've had a we're on the same side and they were kind of squabbling about politics and he decided to make a movie that I liked the idea I like the concept\nBut here's the wrinkle it's not just about people fighting at Thanksgiving different ideologies\nThe president has demanded a loyalty oath which where the where the title comes from and it's a voluntary thing where as a citizen you can sign up for the voluntary or and it makes them tax breaks but it's voluntary you don't have to do it\nOf course that you're not exactly how things go in the movie and then of course not\nJust volunteered which get tax breaks if you do so there's been somebody to do\nIt actually turns out that it's more ... it was good until he turns out to be able to ... and he ends up forcing I'm like let me just let me guess the plotline of where\nThis goes yourself ... you know I don't I don't know how I Do a lot just looking at crystal ball or and I can just imagine the ... in this president ends up just being the most horrific in fact he's probably worse than Hitler himself\nI think he went too far but you're getting into the theme okay so he's worse than um Raul Castro is right in San hose or one of the Castro ... yeah it's big it's pretty nasty you know there's a couple of things one is the writer director I interviewed him for my site actually I wrote about the wire as well\nVery nice guy and you know in this current climate there was a big disconnect between conservatives and liberals where are the ... who says to me nice adventure bureau\nAnd how Twitter hounded him all his liberal friends that he had to basically back pedal and apologize for saying something nice adventure bureau so that well he's not going to talk to me 'cause he's a liberal after about a you know political movie\nHe was super cool answered all my questions and he also uh we're like a ... a signal like the self Olympiad you know if I'll call you back he didn't that day he texted me the next day said hey let's continue the conversation\nSo I Want to get a a shutout to handle it you know we disagree I don't think the movies very good to sadly but\nI gave them a lot of credit for kind of hanging in there with my questions and just being a good guy so I appreciate that\nSo so you can you give me an example of of were like one of those things that you were that that you said that my four weaker person just ever call you back what what was was a tough\nWell I said you know what I said Hollywood is extraordinarily angry at Trump and they said what do you know ... what are your thoughts on that and will that hurt liberals are you hurting your own cause you know and he said well I prefer that we don't get to that level I think we should do it a different way but he says I'm I disagree I\nI don't know where he doesn't think that the liberal should do it that way right or is or he ... he was\nHe said but he doesn't think that's going to hurt liberals at the ballot box he thinks that it that you're not going to turn toward Trump because liberals liberal going so clearly that was just that I mean the answer that directly\nHeat is actually under ... are interested in the thinking behind but what he doesn't take into consideration is is does that ramp up the conservative base to respond to ... you\nCould also the what about the penance were on the fence ... have you so uh yeah I mean I\nYou interestingly ... go to your to police are here but what independence may do which I I wrote a story yesterday about it is\nThey may just not vote yeah so Latino or indicating that there there's like it'd be a very high turnout for Latinos ... is it a few of independence from affiliated that are not turning out\nThen that means that the two ramped up bases are going to be the ones that do it and the Democrats mostly depend upon millennials and younger who say they're going to do it but just like everything else like really say more show up for work", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "19", "locations": [["Washington", 38.89511,

Dallas and who was accused of above of being abusive by a woman with more proof than Christine Blasey Ford ever served up to anyone and then you think about Bill Clinton the person that they couldn't wait to get back in the White House via Hillary\nThey don't seem worried about him they don't say a word about his ... or they don't see a worried about what he was up to how wrong it was they don't have the decency to say we were wrong we shouldn't have rallied around him he should've resigned base and all the things he did\nNot vote the funny thing is not funny but I'm not a funny about oh how funny but we're going to reach back to\n... when he was in high school in those early years in college but we're not reach back to simply essentially the same time period when Bill Clinton wasn't in high school wasn't in college and it was in the oval office mhm but we're not gonna touch them\nNot with a ten foot pole it's just amazing you know when ... when we talked last year about Harvey Weinstein and the whole scandal in me to move in ... birth we thought I thought\nWell that does it how it can get political anymore right ... ... they must have so much shame built into their their lives thinking we covered this up we didn't report it we didn't speak out\nWe had to take a moment to just reflecting what we did wrong and and never do it again and they go right back on that horse and said hey we're gonna wag her fingers at you twenty four seven they're still doing it and I'm sure there's still stuff going on behind the scenes I'm hoping it's less\nI'd just aghast at it and no one talks about this at all and especially in the Hollywood Reporter is in the deadlines and the rats and all these different organizations that are meant to cover Hollywood they don't see a word about the science though\nI get this whole thing you don't have to necessarily speak out against every injustice in the world you know if there's a murder down the street I don't you shouldn't yell at me for not tweeting about how horrible it was I get that but when the industry as a as a collective voice against Brett Kavanaugh and has zero voice against Bill Clinton\nThat something because there's a cultural divide there is a cultural war and they took their side and they they they they are in capable of critical thinking they already capable of self aware as they are inflicted with cognitive dissonance and nothing from ...\nThe thing is the victim of all this is going to be the me too movement the is it because it's been so connected to Hollywood because that's where it ran\nYou're going to think of say wait a minute there they're judging one person the flimsy isn't evidence ignoring all these other people but far greater pieces of evidence\nWhat's missing here what's going on why should I Believe them and by the way and emissions my story just because James Franco was accused of X Y and Z doesn't mean he's guilty I mean she was accused of it right we don't know the whole story\nAnd ah you know but we don't know the whole story of a cabin or either but it looks like there's almost zero information that says he did what he did\nAnd lots of information that suggests he didn't do anything\nI think it I think it does at some point\nIt doesn't necessarily destroy the me too movement with them that faction of mulch real war but it destroys with them those who are not necessarily that involved a of a better observing from from the bottom of the of some distance\nI think it destroys all credibility with people who are a lot of that\nGeo location with which would I say Hollywood again assuming just no no no Burbank but\nCelebrities celebrity yeah you know ... the night shows instead of ... libre brutal and cabinet has has there been a skit about Bill Clinton going out on tour and getting all this money than say a word about that was the fact that she was so protective of him and the fact that ... is a phrase we know because of what he was up to\nYou I haven't looked somebody else made at Columbia to me have to cook dinner\nAbout the late night comedians chemical ... that it was something about the ad agencies are going to continue

checkup after being released from house arrest in Turkey earlier today family spokesman Jordan secular\nIt's a celebration but it's also a time when you're going through a lot of emotions very quickly a lot happening this has been a horrendous process as pastor Brunson set a terrible process for his family\nSomething that nobody could really know that's something that nobody was able to to figure out until now what it looks like oh that's right that televised ritualized torture session of Brett Kavanaugh on national TV turns out Republicans haven't forgotten about that\nAnd it turns out it was a reminder of what we face on the left but I think that the Kavanaugh debacle for the left was really just\nIn a sense the last straw that has pushed them over the edge but they were already heading in that direction and these these symptoms of the mass delusion of leftist that are\nManifesting themselves with these Matt a masters in these mobs coming together and screaming and yelling and this mob mentality\nAnd on and the really the lack of ability on the media's\nPart just set the narrative the way they want you in the air rage which comes out now more on there I think it's because they realize\nTrump is winning he still winning\nThey haven't been able to take him out of office with this Russia collusion investigation nonsense\nThey haven't been able to sing came with Republicans or you know anybody who's persuadable anybody who's open minded about this with all the different allegations of the twenty Fifth Amendment and uh the investigations and his finances I mean the New York times did I think it was a twelve thousand\nWord essay on Trump's taxes stretching back to his father's taxpaying\nPractices in the seventies I think there's some stuff about him in the sixties in there I mean that they they went way way deep into was and I read this piece I thought to myself this is this is kind of like the scene and John Nash the John Nash\nHasn't a Beautiful Mind when he's got all the crazy writing on all this stuff all the formulas and the wall and you and then you realize oh\nThis person has a problem the media has a problem\nFrom maybe has caused it but they're the ones with the problem they are no longer objective in all of this\nAnd now it looks very likely that the Republicans are going to keep the Senate and they have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house\nAnd what will liberal save them and they're really going to all of a sudden you\nKnow just discovered that oh Russia manipulated this election true is that going to be the play\nIt might be but I don't think\nThey have any real belief that that will that will stick with that will work what do they tell themselves now I Know that they comfort themselves with the constant refrain of Trump is racist Trump is a is a a sexist sexual assault or a a traitor a crazy person all these they say all these things\nBut what do they tell themselves about the politics of this country when the president that they say is the worst president of all time which is a pretty common thing you you'll hear on the left the worst president while time unfit for office should be removed from office\nBecause of his his temperament and his judgment in the way that he is doing his job they say he should be removed\nFor that reason and it turns out he's doing a really good job the economy is chicken but\nAnd I'm here in for a lot of people who know and this is their life's work as a study this that\nEven though there's this sense right now oh maybe we have what Greenspan would have called irrational exuberance of oh my gosh things are so great they're just gonna keep getting better and better some people have that a lot of people have the oh it must get worse it must get work will get worse but they've been saying\nThat as you get worse last Eighteen months and it has it so what do they help themselves what did they come away with and this then brings me to the outrage mobs anti fall and the uh you know the the\nMarch ... creatures in the anti Kavanaugh hordes\nThen the the stalkers because that's really what we're talking about these stalkers who are activists that try to find Republicans to harass them to frighten them to scare them away at a Republican who put a\nBlock slap on some hallway stalkers today we'll get to him later big high five bugs issues increasingly looking like the last\nIs gonna have to live and Trump's America for many many years to come and I don't know how they're going to to handle that I don't know how they're going to deal with this is why I've been so worried recently about the possibility of real violence\nBecause they've already gone to the mat they've already taken the dial to eleven they are doing everything everything conceivable\nIn terms of propaganda and organizing and media effort and they're doing everything they can to stop this political movement that Trump is a part of from from reaching its\nIts intended goals from doing what it has set out to do from the beginning and they can't stop it\nAnd I think that what set in with many of them is is not just a a panic but also a sense of helplessness\nAnd the left must be telling them so we thought we were going to get this guy gone with the ... we thought we were going to get this guy gone with any number of different ploys and if we could at least get them going at least we could we could stop him and have you know Americans turn on him and his base turned on him\nAnd the opposite is happening I\nAm more confident in this president and what he's doing and his yes his message as well as his policies with each passing month\nWhat does that mean for the left how do they try to rebound from this how do they try to come up with some counter narrative\nI don't hear it yet all I hear as rage annoys an anger and if this continues on if they don't have any real counterpoint your counter punch for what Trump is doing\nI worry about what their next move will be because I Know that it will not be rational and it will not be in the best interest of this country that we know for sure\nI I tend to think that we could be facing some kind of October surprise along the lines of what they did with Kavanaugh the very end of the nomination process it's not enough that they don't have anything they'll manufacture\nSomething they will create whole call some means of trying to take take the the Trump Administration down a few notches at least enough that they have a successful midterm election I Can't tell you I Know what it is I don't\nBut I get the feeling that they must be cooking something up because they they never give you any sense despite the economy as strong as it is despite all the different things you could point you that that has happened last Eighteen months just good for America\nPeriod they never or reflective on the situation and an honest way\nIt's always Trump lied Trump cheated Trump is a liar and a cheat why haven't we seen his taxes he groped women without their consent why does he have you know such tan skin and and it's crazy orange hair and all this other you know blonde hair all that that they just hate him so much they don't look at this for what it really is\nAnd I do think that the the rage moms or anger than ever because they are reaction to Trump's success they would like you to believe that they are an opposition force their hash tag resistant they stand up for Trump's but that's only part of the story the other part of it\nAnd could lowest right you know the Chinese government needs to be brought into line here and it's going to require some pushing it's not an easy thing to do but Trump is taking on things that he knows are important without regard to well is this the simplest route\nObama showed his what eight years of sitting back relaxing and not really doing very much in thinking you're brilliant for that uh when it comes to foreign policy he showed us what that results in on the world scene you know it was a lot of strategic patience leading from behind a lot of fancy ways of saying\nDon't make any decisions just focus on the process lots and lots of processed lots of talk well turns out that if you are willing to tackle heart problems and make tough decisions you could

these kind of you said it's not that he's crazy it that\nYou could maybe say he's crazy like a Fox I mean it's it's that he actually hit home with some of the things that he was saying when the when I went back and and read the transcript today and spend a little more time listening to some of the soundbites and when you take away all the\nYou know the the sort of flashing lights pomp and

in depth analysis with all the numbers on that\nOr what you put plugs to people that are friends of the show but\nThe fact that he said this upsets oh many liberal they hate when anyone breaks ranks on the issue of guns because guns are such a a simplistic issue for stupid left wing Hollywood\nSocial justice warriors to feel like they're really brave and strong on\nAnd they live in this complete echo chamber of everybody knows that guns are so bad everybody wants to get rid of guns because guns kill people and they won't engage anywhere beyond that I mean I tried to talk to a list a mulatto

you had mandated federal background checks for all purchases and you had to be\nEighteen and you couldn't have a criminal record and you couldn't be a drug user and you couldn't be ever convicted of domestic violence and you couldn't give your cappuccino to anybody else and you couldn't take your cappuccino you know a across state lines and you know you go down this was so yeah\nIt's like buying

years Fox's Julian Turner was more\nDecision and the left media the legacy media in this country listens to what she has to say and it's like now giving her ... ... ... here's the odd thing I mean the whole thing is odd but it was among those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd somebody who's present it as an expert on something\nLike I'll have an author on are all have a geologist honor all have a\nAn actor honor and I'll say this is an activity you might remember from this this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um here's the president's son ... you'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks they'll say that the person who's a contributor what that means is the person who's getting paid for your parents or an analyst\nGenerally speaking never as good as they do\nBut they keep on presenting listen a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her and address illicit mulatto says we need an equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on it and USA Today I've I'm confused why are we doing a story and a list of a lotto\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights and equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment\nThen\nChristie lousy forward would have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment and she's never really said why and again I don't really care why ... why she is not an expert\nI talked about this by talking about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes and people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or the big screen for a long time\nAnd we share our cells well we were you for some reason project intelligence\nOn them a list of a lotto is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue she has yet\nTo make a point that makes sense you have to do a legacy media keeps putting up on high because a she's attractive\nAnd be they think that she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers in general Americans I guess where the dumb people out there like a like me to buy use it as far left wing garbage\nListen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't up\nTheir side they think she does but she doesn't when was the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people like you and me say well I'm definitely not going to vote that way\nLookout dumb that's the thing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos while sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman goes every woman who's telling the truth well we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\n\nThey don't misunderstand me I'm actually at this from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously\nBut you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\nBut there you go you turn on the job or or you read you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa mulatto and they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe a list of all I Do because fill in the blank\nJust doesn't happen oh another trendy thing that's happening today which will boggle your mind is Robert ...\nRobbery robbery we of course the Confederate general who lost\nAnd had to surrender to the U.S rent\n\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio\nAnd praised Robert ... period and their story and of course that's the only period\nAnd their stories your legacy media that large the reviewers of your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talk about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kicked his ass he talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass now the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you don't know that\nThe president set up that way so if they say the president praised Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised rubbery layer they told you drove yes\nBut it's\nAlso a student of omission or reliable mission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nAnd I got to a section of add it make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert he leave and left and waved to the crowd ... it's the best thing ever going to go to my my play neglect Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a ...\nA better thing to say it might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good Betty kicked this guy's Ashley this guy was really good\nThat was the context\nBut white tell the truth when you can lie and correct it later and by the way on social media will you lie under your your legacy media tens of

didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested as an outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it comes down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you that you are you like wasn't up and I sort of a court of appeals in all ... opinion of course the\nFormer vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain was going to write a my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nSo and I think a lot of people actually did that the point of me friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states\nThe Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe law issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost every week it would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment check amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I Would go breath because nobody else was talking about that book share what her action was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right he talked about injustice and\nJustice being delayed for Alaskan because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power\nAnymore say over Alaska so for me to be messing around with that I that was very very dangerous and the other thing is that Trump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing our ally in decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nThat's o F F E R to seven nine six four or five\nSelfless

I guess they hit the right buttons that one day and getting that anonymous strange a message on Facebook\nEnded up getting the interviewing and hopefully we'll have run again and again and again um I Do hope she runs native Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski showed that she is not who she told Alaska she would be when she said she'd be a Republican there is no reason for any Republican\nOr anybody who's a conservative a traditional American values person to say no to Brett Kavanaugh uncorroborated allegations don't count\nI'm innocent until proven guilty due process do count\nAnd and hurt no vote was a ridiculous boom\nAnd hope that people will ask are smart enough to get a rise out of there as soon as they can it is a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty will have energy

therapy that are trying to make this breed when your own trainer ask me what I wanted to talk about I mentioned that I read an article or some kind of go by couldn't validate where the article came from so I'm going to change my question to\nIn this election how do we check invalidate every person involved in counting Electra ... votes to make sure they can corrupt the actual vote tallies critical areas of our country\nWell allegedly there are checks and balances in place but I don't trust it a lot of his electronic voting um I I think is is scary because you can hack these machines I don't know how to do it but what do you know these these guys out there do know how to do it if you're going to happen during our government or hack into Facebook are\nHappy to fill in the blank Yahoo um if you could do those things actually do a lecture machine I Would think would be very hard um so I don't know how we guarantee that I got I got to tell you Doug I I've been voting for as long as I can remember and I can't tell you for sure that my vote counted every time I still go\nAnd I'll continue to go but we are leaving it to a very small number of people to validate something that\nThat we all hope will do that they'll get right\nIt's a great question I don't have a good answer\nAs fast you know all of a sudden it's about a whole box of votes were counted in critical elections and it's like\nOh well we have I I I'm guessing that you're you might be referring to Minnesota where Al Franken won and he shouldn't have but suddenly there were votes veterans somebody's car trunk\nIt just doesn't make any sense and it is it's a scary proposition although I Am bullied a little bit bother with the election results are twenty sixteen ... election that will that would have been the one but I think they let their guard down I ...\nThey let their guard down because they bought Hillary Clinton was going to win rather easily\nIt sounds like our votes Li do ... but it's a great

my former governor the former governor great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America now\nAnd you might wonder well what does that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about ... we're talking about liquefied natural gas would get him to an war as well uh ... appreciate you how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know Texas but it's a it's what I call temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected\nWith several people on your staff and I I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you and your uh uh globetrotters now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia we did you know that that was going to entail owners\nAre not necessarily but\nUh what's happened is is the energy revolution a run his odds that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's you know we are now\nSelling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent as groups and\nUh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being later and making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and has a uh as as transparent as it\nCan be but it's also to be the you know a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied\nNatural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIs the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining ... putting terms is going to ruin trade and in no time slabs\nLeaky you stepped up and said we're making the deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade him in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas now are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make it part of the deal how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the cause the secretary of treasury minutiae and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross gay all have a\nA a role to play in that and and so absolutely there's a there's there's good and a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's\nOn the same team I Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary [laughter]\nThat's true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade you and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a young and came back in here or after they laid out some really tough ah a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs in retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a they know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese don't lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would lead them\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of the Indian good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently\nAnd our economy here still booming onto the great guidance of a great job but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through\nBefore you can actually get to a source of use you when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it as these things were outdated you know think about that North American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two is running side that was twenty five years ago\nAnd and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are still a developing at the energy sources that we were buying\nAnd now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different\nPositions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president will say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it\nIn the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a safe that had the look of beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also

being freed from two years of captivity in Turkey took time out to thank President Trump and members of Congress are fighting for his freedom\nNo I mean let's face it to her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle of her\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and that's what they got they they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you ought to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed is way but that's what her attorneys did to her\nIt's a Senator Ron Johnson resolutely right last question on cabin on automobiles to be on affordable healthcare act in in\nYou guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left is screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nI mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their mind for we're not going to kick them off the court 'cause we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell was there an angry mob and they they've been they've had this primal screams cents a day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you know I've never seen his like this job you know in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous and secure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this mystery from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican race did Wisconsin let's talk about the an Affordable Care act you supported the president as it all Republicans and has been all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and and do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually helped people of the major\nAmount of people that were paying that find that taxing the an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys had a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case you were a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it\nA of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care planning ...\nFamilies who have their previous reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside to be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act reverse rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer Reno ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates in Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mom and care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current levels so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back\nAnd nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nThe Obamacare exchanges if you can afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to somebody you set a second ago and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something that just really reiterate that former senator if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of coverage for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right so the ... the protection in terms of pre existing conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they've been priced out of the bond care exchanges\nWe're giving them an option to be asked to be able to afford health insurance for once\nOkay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when women ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because

I heard today somebody may mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... tank and he's ... he didn't work all the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational to think that politically people can make this happen\nI'm I that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the

know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big roads bridges\nYeah no I I think\nSo investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people you think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things but\nReally what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this sets them the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of

they just close their eyes of the in some cases actually or outright helping I mean look the Democrat that's why it's called the calls smiley corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their majority superPAC helping Senate Democrats decided to re route three million dollars to help Bob Menendez in his race on money that they're taking away from even more important races for them or where they're trying to defend seats on and places like Trump won\nUm because he's in so much trouble but in essence this is the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption have get their adult trail of evidence that very clear in fact the senators on record saying that he engaged in corruption but we're still going to do everything we can return him to office\nAnd I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous or boxing loving and one of them is on this uh as as on the notion of corruption which as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans but do you have so many Democrats you start to think about all the Democrats have gone to prison than the last oh four or five years for\nIncredibly obvious a very shady corruption and that never gets brought up in in any of this discussion as I said there's always this big old Trump most you know someone starts telling me about the ... that tends to be what I hear about a\nBut also on on the notion of mobs I I have to say I am I have been surprised and I take it very dim view of much of the of the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are a journalist on something else but I'm pretty close to journal land\nBut most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim I'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy looking absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have\nCivil society we have to pay it so that we don't have mob rule just because you're citing when an election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination\nParents absolutely nothing written in any of that formal or informal rolls of our society that give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added ... hound them at a restaurant\nUm this is the fact precisely why we have a ballot box in elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN I've seen a couple on there anyway and well eight not ma and be they're just saying what they think\nWe all know that's not true I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper or you go to vote\nOr that you know harassing people on the street is not and that's the best it got then conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy Maris\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and so to to ask you to make a production I mean who really knows but just in in a minute or so we have less you're Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic UC right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republicans the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which you won't hearing on the mainstream media\nIs how different this is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can already saying with complete definite proof that the Democrats blown it to a certain extent they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down five seats one way or the other right\nOn whoever does win and going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still and\nGive us Ross everybody on the wall Street Journal check out her columns and also her book the intimidation\nIm him always appreciate you make the time for us come back soon\nAnd\nYeah I I think he was a lot on there with the it's gonna be five she is going to be such a narrow margin I I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time I'm although you should listen for all the show election I obviously a but we're not going to know who control the house I think I'm by\nThe time this show is is over um I think it's going to stretch will I get the polls closed around age there's no way we would know okay yeah this is not even close but we might not even know till I don't know maybe the next morning it's gonna it's gonna be drawn out\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which goes to tell you you know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist and destroying America\nAnd now they're praying and hoping that they can not have a blue wave but a little blue ripple a little bit [noise]\nIt's crazy right now you got the left freaking out chasing people at a restaurant screaming at little old ladies and\nAnybody that shows up at a Trump rally in words demographer had you've got all kinds of nonsense going on about the post Kavanaugh rage from all the different progressive how about we all just stop that crap and drink some delicious coffee how about that for an idea\nBecause that's where I Do every day I drink whack rifle coffee every morning I drink at all on black because it is delicious high quality small batch roast or coffee I've made\nConverts all of my office I'm like why are you drinking at ... when you could be drinking black rifle a company\nFounded by veterans and it's all about delicious coffee go check it out for yourself [noise] nothing cares about attitudes quite like starting your day with the most American coffee ever black rival coffee visit black rival coffee dot com slash ... Fifteen Percent off your order that black rifle coffee\nDot com slash book for Fifteen Percent off like level coffee dot com slash bar [noise]\n\nSelfless service super guiding principle but drives Army National guard soldiers to be always ready whenever\nDisastrous dry your your next door neighbors and your colleagues in offices\nUh we can give a diplomatic statement about it we can say this was terrible you should never have done this\nBut we're not going to prosecute anyone we don't have any mechanism even for prosecuting anyone a this was a crime committed on Turkish soil so we don't have any jurisdiction here to speak up it was also donate a conflict so it was done on Saudi soil on Turkish soil\nSo this is a diplomatic issue this is between nation states guy was not a U.S citizen now I Know he was a green card holder he was a permanent resident a lot of people focus in on that but\nDo you still not a citizen or he held foreign citizenship show we don't why is this the president situation primarily to handle you know why is this something where the president of the United states is the one guy who is supposed to take definitive action\nAnd we do we know the answer the answer is that is because the left wants to play this game of you know Trump is terrible and Trump is a dictator and all this other stuff or any loves dictators here's Obama's former\nPublic relations propaganda czar from inside the White House Ben Rhodes and this is how dirty he's willing to be political fought\nWhat we're seeing her Christmas is really the continuation of a profound re alignment of American foreign policy under Donald Trump\nWhere we no longer speak up for democracy and human rights we no longer speak up for a journalist that we call them the money is enemy of the states and we're giving a green light not just the Saudi regime\nBut ... any regime around the world who wants to harm dissidents harm journalists because the most powerful democracy in the world is no longer on their side\nI think it has with Jared his son in law he's been sort of his vice Roy when it comes to dealing with the Arab world I think he feels that somehow he's in bed with this royal family over there that is sort of Romanoff folly of family\nAnd their families seem to be locked together Jared yes it is and his crown prince seemed to be in bed together politically\nYeah ... ... ... oh my gosh I don't know why anyone I don't want anyone listens to that guy just showed desperate to hang on and be relevant he must be good friends with the management MSNBC I don't know why people listen to what I really don't know among one of the worst analysts on TV\nOr a total of leave it used to be a conservative and say whatever you have to say to try to be relevant at any point in time but you you have there are two different versions of giant bull crap\nA bull crap coming from Ben Rhodes is that this is Trump's fault that the ... the murder is because Trump calls CNN you know the enemy of the people\nAre I I hate to break it to you but you know there are journalists there are propaganda apparatus sigh in countries where journalists are the enemy of the people straight up\nIs the north Korean ministry of propaganda the enemy of the north Korean people yes is North Korean state media the enemy of the north Korean people whether the ... yes same thing is true in Iran than destroying a lot of countries\nJust being a journalist did not give you some moral superiority which I Know is a shock to all the swamp dwelling journalists around me here in Washington DC they they really think that there's a national and they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nAnd this is as you always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know\nThat that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them work with the sleeves again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the pathway anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads and then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and ... where we could create a cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get you ignore that's a fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis any meaningful way\nFor running one of the crappy as countries on earth despite all of its oil wells no administrator no president including Obama who's battling literally bowing to the south it's okay to everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStopped making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do I don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure what he's a columnist\nThe guy was in a is an opinion writer for no I'm not saying that means that you know anything as happened to him but the way they're talking about him is like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile as anybody ever writes an opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked me to an American conservative Web and attacked somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less outrage about this\nJust the fact it is\nJust that if if it were someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack the Islamic in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis for that guy out that say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered and but you know there's a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up a good she'll be was and this is a fact and\nIslamist meaning he believed in political Islam and was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood is like your trampling on the man's great\nThat's that's just telling the truth\nHe wasn't Islamist nobody he wouldn't deny this view were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean you should have been brutally murdered\nOh I I almost left out that he also uh that they dress the somewhat up as a body double in his clothing after they killed him to try to create footage of him leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to and they must not have known that the fiance was outside because they were going to try and say that he left in that they had no knowledge and they were going to disappear and\nThat was the plan to disappear him and they are just really really dumb about it\nLet me give you a little bit of in jail agency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operate that this was a little bit of an inside baseball for you to like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain you know the regime's security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are\nTheir primary concern is ripe regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasions most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside\nUm and\nThey get very adapted dealing with that threat\nBut they also often operate in places where they can be really\nHam fisted\nI guess that's kind of the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean they can\nBe clumsy and sloppy and get away with it and that's what I think happened here the Saudis\nThe Saudi intelligence services the Saudi police state can be sluggish in Saudi Arabia and can be thug issue in other Middle Eastern countries where they have a lot of sway\nCan't really be self sufficient turkey\nAnd that may have been miscalculation here they thought that they could get away with this and they're not used to operating on foreign soil where there's also a very by the way sluggish intelligence apparatus apparatus that is at work\nSo a lot of intrigue here we'll be right back\nThere's been a change in the last few months people have started to realize that social media platforms are not a public utility they're not they're just for the free exchange of ideas they are Internet companies but they're also media outlet they are platforms and they make editorial decisions all the time and guess what\nThe big ones out there are making editorial decisions that favor Democrats progressive and the left and they're doing it on a regular basis you know this you heard about the shadow ban and you've heard about the deep platform ing\nObvious strategies that I've seen him in a in a modern campaign we just literally show off everywhere all the time for every one you can be without interruption in from the battle back much I Love your thinking well you\nKnow there's so many [laughter]\nYou know rock star amazing NATO that's a reporter got the Mike and and the whole thing you know star really that's what\nYou say the the the guy that\nThis is your interview subject now like I Know people were saying oh you're so great but does anyone has any reporter\n... from the big mainstream journalist outfits out there has anyone on the left or or even in the ... the quote mainstream media is down in the middle journalists the big lie but they still couldn't do it have they ever gone to somewhere with Trump like wow you're you're a political phenomenon the likes of which this country has probably never seen\n'em does anyone ever say that they they say he's a rock storming Trump's if they do it was a rock star Trump is a some kind of super human superstar right but they would never do that and I'm not saying that they should I just want to know the comparison between the two because when you take a look at it you can find very obviously that\nYou know they they buy into this mythology runs got ... ... says by the way you know always show handsome you so charismatic I I don't see it at all\nI don't I don't know what I mean I like the guy was okay looking and you know sounds okay and as the old saying things strikes me as kind of funny but I I guess there's a and a myth a kind of mixing\nHere in their minds of that running a person from a red state as a down home Democrat who can speak to the whole country and but also has that kind of youth and who charisma thing that Obama had\nSo it's almost like the best of Bill Clinton the best of Obama politically speaking pulled together\nUm and I think that is how they view which uh I think that's kinda the way that cause they're obsessed with this guy\nAnd I'll tell you this and I've seen some other saying and I think it's true\nThey know he's going to lose going to lose by double digits up until he lose by by nine or ten points\nThat's what they think that a lot of good enough showing in Texas the case will be they'll win all the blue states and be competitive in the red\nStates and he can take on Trump\nAnd I'm here to tell you that Trump would crush him so bad\nNews radio I'm Brian shook the president isn't calling Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz lying Ted anymore President Trump is in Houston tonight rallying

of public service announcement from Amnesty International which is an organization that apparently has a lot of time on its hands and Amnesty International thinks that people need to be told via fairy

guess I don't know she kind of plays at a you know attractive youngest blonde female uh I I've never seen a really extend herself the man who cares I'm not a thespian critic\nOr a critic of the attack\nA but she said that she's worried about what will happen to young women that see or people in general including her daughter I think she said with a fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty who escaped to wake her up from her dream because that there was a violation of could send that goes on there now I pointed out to you last week that\nThe the point is really not that there's a consent issue because they were talking about it which who has a magic apples and somebody's in a coma from eating the apple and it is a is a fairy tale\nAnd really the only way for her to be awoken which is the the storyline is by a prince to kiss her she saved her life like kissing her\nShow it's really almost like he's performing mouth to mouth resuscitation I Would say and therefore he does have consent if we're going to take it to this weird place where we're talking about this\nBecause if somebody is choking and you give the mouth to mouth resuscitation you don't have to say hey can you can you verbalize that your choking and I'm going to give you or you know or they're ... they're hard to stop and choking as the Heimlich hard to stop you get the idea\nAh some out to mouth resuscitation you know in in a fairy tale is really what we're talking about here but they ran with this\nThey didn't stop they weren't they weren't it wasn't enough for them to just say I have an actress because there was another one I forget who another actress came at all I'm worried about fairy tales and the patriarchy so they're they're destroying centuries old stories\nThat is instill very basic one creative sensibility and young people but also have some basic morality entailed so good and evil and now they're fairy tales they're meant for amusement I\nPromise you I don't know a single guy who in college age was like well because the handsome prince can kiss the girl in a coma or I can kissed this girl in real life you're like no one would ever think that nobody no human being has ever ever ever thought that\nSo this was a problem that did not exist but now they've gone even further with it and you know in that video I don't want to play it again for you because you've already heard it\nBut you know there's some very ... first of all there's a curse and there's some\n... and they make it very clear that there are some are kind of crude sexual humor in there as well and referring to the initial that he uses and everything and he's clearly supposed to be an entitled frat bro the president there there's all the the patriarchy left wing stuff is there\nBut you know this is what the what the left doesn't\nYet grass is that they lose on this stuff\nThey lose on these cultural issues where they are acting like maniacs um and and this brings me to not just this battle over fairy tales and consent\nBut this whole this whole story that broke today about how Trump is\nAh taking is telling the D O D J now um that they should this is this is the storyline at least a that transgender
