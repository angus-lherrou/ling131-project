[{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "Although I don't know if they're in Los Angeles for for what are my favorite of all I Want to go out and make a difference I didn't find that working behind a desk so familiar with the officer serve argument for her was just hard\nTo learn how to be part of the Army National guard logged on to the national guard dot com sponsored by the Colorado Army National guard\nBroadcasters association at this station radio pretty affordable system isn't it uh\nIt definitely is and when you're considering um hospital possible hospitalizations I'm I'm a fall and especially laying there for a long time and\nIt's definitely something that you can be proactive with an an affordable product and that can help keep families safe and keep ... parents at home longer and independent and help the children feel more confident that mom and dad are safe at home and they don't have to worry so much because they know\nThat if they were to have a fall that um that it's just that push the button and they can get help\nUm and actually we do have some um units that have followed the catching them\nSo with that ah technology even if somebody were to fall and hit their head and be unable to push a button and it very accurate and get in determining a fall and will call for help and even if a button isn't pushed so um that's just\nThat's really great for under fifty bucks a month mom or dad can still live at home even though you've got concerns about that they could still live at home they can get some help on the side\nBut if that helps not there are no one's around that they do fall under fifty bucks a month you know you're really given them that independence that they're really seeking and then after that of course you've got to you know you've got to try to mitigate that for the future but what a what a great program and and and talk about the apparatus what is it is it big as it small\nUm it's not bad and ah the one with the fall detection has to be one around the neck\nAnd because that's how it detects the fall we do have some buttons that can be more in on the wrist and those are mostly for people that are more and just in the in the home\nUm by themselves sometimes and aren't really going out and about um without somebody with them and but with the ones around the neck we have some that actually are a mobile devices that people can take with them anywhere and they have all detection and um and\nAnd if they were to fall if they were at the grocery store or out for a walk in the neighborhood and it would detect that fall or they could push a button and then it has GPS locating in it so that um help would be able to find them where they are\nOkay so if somebody wants to this is something that you know maybe a need for my mom and dad how do we get it set up how hard is it to get it set up moms though\nIt's it's very easy um again you can just call the same number that you call for that the safety of senior conference that's our main lifeline number it's five for five one two one two and\nAnd just give us your name information and we will just figure out what kind of questions that we need from asking some kind of questions to get the information that we need 'em\nTo get you all set up and our service reps are all local so that they couldn't get out there and probably the next day and get mom or dad set up and so it's a very easy simple process and to get\nInto the plugs into the phone I mean they just have to connect it right so that it\nUses the phone system to be able to call so as long as there is a technical person they're they come to the home when they get that all set up so mom and dad are in good shape but that's ... that's the whole deal here yeah this is good so\nIf some of you avoided this and I know people don't want that added monthly fee and\nYou know oil I think I'll pass on that I'll just hollowed out for the neighbor\nYou know I've heard all sorts of stories about that and I think it's really something that you need to think about so given that phone number one more time this is lifeline that they get something that you all should consider\nIt's five for five one two one two\nThat's great well this has really been a I think an important part of our community that is really stretch started out in ...\nTwenty six years ago and now look at it going all the way to Durango and and as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of books grannies\nYou'll learn a little tiny towns and it's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are yeah and whether you're in assisted living whether you're an independent living or at home or maybe you're living with your kids\nI mean what a great what a great opportunity to have that extra hand in the house for under fifty\nBucks a month yes definitely what is it number to call once more five for five one two one two great that's so easy to remember five for five to one too so yeah\nWe be thinking about life line if you don't already have it I Know that they could uh probably take care of your pretty pretty quick\nYeah and I did I did want to mention that they don't even have to have a a land line at home and we also have a mobile units and even with our new go safe to button and that doesn't have to be connected to the base unit at all so under a lot of different options depending on if they still have a home phone or if they have a mobile device\nUsing technology grant and this is the thing

for us and for you this appearances are always extremely popular and we get lots of calls and I know you look forward as I Am having John with us next Saturday on the around the house a program [noise]\nLet's see some email from this week we can get started here whatever's on your mind give us call thrill three seven one three to five five uh this is from Dick ... with the septic tank I liked the uh uh I I Want to know the best way to unplug\nToilets and sinks in tubs that are really slow I've got a septic tank and do I use drain cleaner or what it wants to know well\nA ... my view on a septic tank is the less chemicals you put in the better or is a delicate microbial balance in a septic tank you don't want to disturb that because the bacteria there are processing the sewage sludge falls to the bottom of the tank and the sewage gets eaten up if you will do which is\nI Know it's an odd way to put it but it gets the process by the bacteria\nSo you don't want to do anything that will interfere or kill friendly bacteria and that would apply to most\nDrain cleaner they're pretty harsh there are some septic friendly drained cleaners that are enzyme based uh that you could you could try but I\nBut I liked the idea of mechanical cleaning you really don't need\nA sewer cleaning chemicals for most fixtures in your house it just helps to clean the junk out of the trap now a and mechanical cleaning is the easiest thing of all because he simply get yourself a brush a sewer cleaning or drained cleaning brush usually they have a kind of a\nA long wire handle on him that you can bend around corners and so on others one brand name has called the turbo brushed but nevertheless they looked like a\nBottle brush memory you know when you have little babies in your house\nUh years ago we would use of bottled brush to clean out the baby's bottles before we sterilized and the same idea here only this this this rush the bristles are\nSmaller diameter only an inch inch and a half or so and as long wire handle and most of these and you're simply ... in in the drains that you're worried about you simply just shove it down in there like the the maybe your master bathroom shower\nIs full of hair and other gunk and you just ran this brush good pop the little dream screen off first of course\nAnd run this terrible rash down into the drain and pull the junk back out of the drain the trap and\nAnd put it in a paper towel and roll it up and put it in the trash that's very very easy without using chemical drained cleaners the same idea with the laboratory but the laboratories a special case because you could get to the trap underneath with tubs and showers of course\nThe trap is still there but it's hidden it's away from access for you so that terrible rash really works well in terms of showers with a laboratory you use the same brush if you want to\nBut it's just as easy to put a bucket under the sink\nAnd take that trap apart and dump it all into a into the bucket and clean it out then you can use your terrible brush to clean the pipe that goes into the wall sometimes\nYou know is it a lot of the culprit here are are is dental floss that gets caught in there or if you drop a vitamin pill down in the laboratory drain those all act to clog up the drain and trap junk as it tries to get down into the sewer so you can clean all that piping out clean the trap out\nUh with easy access under laboratory but with the top of the shower\nThe mechanical dream cleaning a is a is a good deal if you have\nPeople in your house like a you know your wife or daughters have long hair that tends to get in the drain you you might uh in the tub and showers you might want to put a little drains screening there there's a I think the name is actually a hair screen\nA little plastic gizmo that has a bunch of holes drilled in it or that you put over the existing drain and uh the hair will be trapped on that on that plastic disc and you can throw it in the bathroom wastebasket but it keeps at\nThat hair a hair is really the enemy of drains of traps and showers and in tub so if you can trap that hair it's better than getting it down the drain in the first place but with a septic tank\nI like actually with all drank septic or city sewer\nMechanical drained planning really is better I guess for the environment and in general than chemicals if you want to use a drink leaning chemical of course I've talked before about\nUh the uh plumbers acid ... acid works really really well to unplug a drains and traps and a drain of course is the opposite chemically of the plumbers as if you can use drain also so\nUh works pretty well mechanical drain cleaning it's a big deal to keep those dreams nice and clean and you have less or gas smell in your house in the first place thrill three seven one three\nEight to five five will be back that's got a question about hot water circulation talk about\nRight [noise] right here around the house\nAnd I played the wrong team in Tony scratching his head wondering what that's all\nAbout so let's try this\n[noise] joined ...\nHeavy Saturday at eight thirty for the senior living today show show about seniors for seniors and move them on the love them they'll cover topics relating to how\nIndependent and overall wellbeing of seniors right here in southern Colorado\nIn your living today is ... ... and other ... senior living today show with David Brenner late Saturday morning said he only here on the top five nine ...\n[noise] over two hundred and sixty years later with a little resource\nIngenuity and\nWe're not only capturing energy\nEnsuring Americans have the energy they need whenever\nWe can reduce the number of opioid prescribed after surgery [noise] I just ten percent [noise]\nIt was almost three hundred and\nFewer leftover pills available each year for potential for her and she has\nThese prescription painkillers are not are only option for treating pain [noise] especially after surgery to learn more visit planned against ... dot com\n[noise]\nAnd screen and filter area and the bottom of a dishwasher I think twice a year so you might tell your friends that you talk to me and and I do mine about every six months because it's ... it really is gross you you want to put on rubber gloves it's black\nAnd just left just awful and I needed\nRotting it's gotta be riding said\nWell it is it's just yeah food residue a and you know in the summertime\nUh this summer I don't know this is the first time this summer or my dishwasher started the one that was the cycle was done my dishes smells funny they smelled sort of had a kind of a fishy odor\nTo him and I was grossed out by it and so I took the ... the spray arm off and all those filters and covers underneath and it was a pretty dirty under there are so ah I built up much quicker than I thought it was going to do so yeah you got to clean out often you're absolutely right so I Do I see here OK\nOkay twice a year thanks so much\nYou got it good to hear from you know if yeah is it it it is a function of course of oh often you do your dishes the more often you know I Do mine uh I live by myself so I Do run my dishwasher but once a week\nAnd I know many of you with larger families run years two or three times a week and then more often you run it the less of these issues you're going to have because the the the the the crowds and the bottom of the dishwasher won't get a chance to harden a and be more resistant to uh to moving through there so\nUh partly my fault there are by the way there are a dishwasher cleaners do help there is one\nIs a dishwasher magic there's there's one it's a little plastic bottle you screw the cap you and it has a little wax seal and then you turn it upside down in the dishwasher and then run a cycle and the wax plug melts and releases all the liquid them in all that so you might try a dishwasher magic and I think that's the name\nUh every uh every few months but got to clean that dishwasher yeah that's a big deal because you just get a lot of gross stuff under there and of course of between dishwashing there's you know the water's kind of warm and you'd get bacterial growth down there which you don't want or don't want either so\nCheap that clean if your dishes clean and ah and if you have you know kind of film and other dish washing your shoes that they don't seem to be as clean as they used to that may be the problem thrill three seven one three eight to five five we'll be right back\n[noise] ...\nMaking a murderer became led the TV show of force of nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal\nJustice it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan gassy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to overeat budding a murder mounting a\nMurderer is now on the ... hour radiolab just open the up and\nThey found directly from live radio kept him out of the week I had ... I had radio I'll act that way you kind of limited and you think ... [noise]\nHear the news about it with him is a red line for us Sean Hannity weekday afternoon from one to four\nYou talk five Ninety ACS Jay Z fifty nine Nineteen Denver stuck station six thirty Kay how\nGot a big problem for your house can moon can help until three ... three seven on three ... three oh three seven on three eight to five five more rights twenty five minutes before the hour we're going to have you with us ...\nOne three eight to five five I guess the guy just said that but I said it again or some people say I give the phone number too fast so I Try to save as often as I can and\nSlower than I may be a would normally do it just to make sure you get it it's um a phone number seven to one three talk on your telephone do we'd love to hear from you this morning give us a call in the meantime\nGary sent me an email is an expansion tank on his water heater and and it's on the wrong side is on the uh\nHot water aside not cold supply line is it important to get this corrected I've never seen an expansion tank on a hot water side I think the cold water aside because you're trying to\nUh ... you're you're trying to accommodate expansion in the entire system not just the hot water side so I Would switch it to the cold water line just before the water here but those if you don't may not have one in your house they're becoming more and more common and expansion tank is a great idea\nOr if in at your house and I would have a strongly recommend you get one if you don't have one it's a little one gallon tank where the rubber bladder in it there's water on one side an air on the other and as the water heater he's of course the water expands as it heats in ads extra pressure to the system\nWhich means that you can develop little leaks here and there that you normally would not occur and so the expansion tanker rubber bladder moved back and forth a little bit to absorb that expansion when the water heater ticks on most\nNew home builders put an expansion taken you can add one very easily\nAs I said it goes on the cold water line just before\nThe water heater and uh you should changers theory for a for sure let's see um what what oh here's one from my friend Paul up in Wyoming I we're talking about that ought to assert pump to get hot water more quickly or to far away parts of the house\n[noise] uh let's see this is from ... from Paul I have here we go I've had an auto search for Twenty years on her kitchen sink the auto temperature timer didn't really get the job done it wasn't hot only needed it so installed a Fifteen minute timer on the moon need hot water\nReturn on the timer for five minutes so we have a hot water with much less the way much less waste will\nThank you for that poll I that's the first\nComplaint I've heard like that about the auto Sirte but nevertheless people you know there are a little pricey but they're easy to install yourself you don't\nIn most cases have to go out and hire a plumber if you don't want to the ... bridge across the hot and cold water lines there was a a statistic I saw ... years ago\nThat the average family waste about fourteen or Fifteen thousand gallons of water a year waiting for a hot water to come to a far away fixture a and some people have called here and said they\nThey collect that water or not all of it but a lot of it to water their house plants which is a\nA pretty good idea but when you want to go to work in the morning you're in a hurry you're running late you don't have time to do that so getting hot water to far away fixture I think is important in these little bumps or a pretty good idea now listen if you have an unfinished basement or across space where you have access underneath the house\nThe most efficient way to do this and I see this in custom\nHomes is very very common in the in expensive custom homes to have a third pipe you have the hot water and the cold water and a third re circulating pipe that runs back into the water heater so again you can set up this conviction loop\nOr without any of the side effects of having lukewarm cold water as we talked about if you have access underneath your house you could put a third by all the way from the water heater use that plastic ... by if you want all the way from the water heater to the far away bathroom\nAnd there you go you've you've got a third pipe for the actual re circulating itself and you'll have almost instant hot water twenty four hours a day does waste a little energy but it doesn't waste water so there's your trade off John in\nCheyenne listening on occasion it'd be good morning John Hi\nHey Ken how are you\nAll rights or what's going on\nUm my wife and I had a Cape Cod style house here and we were anything the upstairs we put into that we got a re circulating on uh-huh it's on top of the water heater\nWe in the water heater closet and then it re circulate up the second floor bathroom\nRight and instead of using that time or what I did all everything was open is that ran a a wire down for the outlet so when you go in the bathroom you switch on and it's dark five minutes later he got hot water\nAh okay so you you turn years on and off manually did you get John did you put a third pipe in\nI I Can't because I Would have had tried as the one we had a house bill water lines are just it attacks type was ran up to the second floor ready yet I Would have had it like here's a track\nIf you're going to use the bathroom and you don't want the warm water I discovered this by accident but at work when you turn to pump off if you just use the toilet one time it'll clear any warm water and that\nIt will suddenly water back up to the bathroom yeah Adam\nI got I got it at home depot the talk\nYeah with everything including the the actual line to tie everything together the one way now and the company also lets you if you call them you can order it it we can put a second in St Garnett per se or you have a rational water heaters in the middle\nAnd you've got a shower at one end and the kitchen at the other way you can have it on ... and it'll bring the hot water\n[laughter] do you remember what you paid for it uh it was right around two hundred and ... yeah that's what I thought\nBut they're required by government rules to pay retail and that's not fair it's not fair to your neighbors who are retail rate payers for you to get a retail kickback instead of wholesale\nAnd of course the subsidies for solar panels there big huge subsidies at your neighbors have to pay in the form of taxes or higher rates on their electric bill so the question is why should your neighbors pay for your solar panels when the whole scheme is simply a scheme to um\nTo pretend to make the earth greener\nTo be a to have the moral high ground in terms of of carbon\nAnd all that garbage to me it's it's it's just the way it's it's preening but not economically let alone thermal dynamically feasible or does\nHerbal fossil fuels because of all the fracking are very very low priced and now that we have mostly natural gas from fracking that's much lower in terms of you know in terms of its effect\nOn the environment and so on and so I I just I just don't think it's a good deal I Would pass this by solar uh it does not stand on its own\nAll the subsidies are huge for solar and wind there are some cities of course I Know you are going to be thinking that you're thinking that right now for fossil fuels what they are very very low compared to the ... for a megawatt subsidies for solar and wind\nWe have lots of fossil fuels we're discovering more every day I think it's time to put solar and wind on their own if they're going to make it let them make it on their own uh and getting rid of all these huge subsidies\nFor the solar and wind industry and let let things rise and fall and stand on their own if they will if they want\nThen there were just need to pass them by so I Would not do the Susan I don't think it's a good deal economically for your for your family if you want solar panels I Would go out and price them and buy them and put them on and have your own solar system installed and looked at the end of it but\nI don't know where the low cost of fossil fuels I'm not sure it's a good deal for you in the first place thrilled three seven one street eight to five five you have some feedback on that I'd love it if you'd call in here because uh we can kick that around or anything else is on your mind where to take one more break up before the top of the day\nBefore the top of the hour by the way\nJohn ... next week ten o'clock hour I Know you'll\nBe here we always enjoy John's appearances we'll be right back right here\n\n... [noise] that's why there's around the house with Ken\nGot an email here from John ah he's got a little frustrating situation going on that I'd hear from time to time and have had the same thing in my life as a a a bath fan a kind of a generic bath fan a and he's having a hard time matching it up\nTo replace the motor is quit working and a ... wants to know what to do is the vision and having to rip out sheet rock so we can get to the fan and pull the fan down in unhook it and get a new fan their wealth\nOr not so fast or John because I've been through this myself you can usually get a a new motor for almost any bath fan because they are generic replacements\nIt's not a big deal of course you turn the fan off and then you are an screw or pop off there is a grill cover on the ceiling\nFor your bath fan or in and set that aside and they'll the motor we'll be right there with two or three screws Philip screws you just on a do it the motor will drop down into your an typically you have to unplug the wires from the from the fans frame itself\nAnd then there it is in your hand that little motor or with the fan blades on it and you just simply\nA call ... down to a heating supply company you know these this is not a heating\nContractor these are companies there's a company in Denver called Charles ...

Bennett Aurora good morning how are you been\nGood can um you know maybe I have in mind this restaurant tour product religiously and yesterday I got a surprise and that will make a winter either you know that\nI did know that Yes sir\nWell maybe I didn't messing it uh but I was that low I was really surprised to see it\nNo I didn't know that I haven't used it and the reason is better and it's it's it's something I probably should pay more attention to I just go by four or five six bags of ritual on at a time and just keep them in the garage\nAnd just use them until the end but the winter rise or I'm not you know I Need to ask John that next week is there a little different formulation from the regular fertilizer I'm not sure\nYeah compared to ... bags and there is a difference\nAnd do you remember all is is maybe the uh maybe the less nitrogen and more of the of the phosphorus perhaps I I'm not sure that\nYeah yeah I just wanted to add that on your can I appreciate you're doing that yeah thank you been having safety\nYou to you too thank you for that feedback yeah I should probably be more attention to it also and by the winter riser formulation I'm sure it has\nNitrogen to encourage less leaf or a growth more phosphorus to encourage more uh you know a deeper in a better root system to encourage that\nBut it is a ... you know right about now would be as bad as late as you want to get\nIn doing your last fertilizing of the season so it's going to be a nice weekend if you're going to do it at all I Would sure do it this weekend to get it over with and then do kind of a deep watering to get that fertilizer down deep into your lawn roots and your lawn trust me\nWell thank you next spring you'll have much less winter burn a and the your lawn will just look healthier quicker or in the spring that you know that a winter burn is\nIt it's just you know it was with us\nSeems every year that we have these dry winters and so you want to make sure your winter watering end your winter is Asian fertilizing has done a right now so you can avoid that if you can [noise]\nLet's see this is from well let me see let me get back to the right page you're okay this is from Arnold we had a skylight league during a recent rains now we have about a four by twelve mold area on the ceiling should I be concerned about\nAbout this yeah you should be concerned but not panicked about it as long as it's completely dried out and the sheet rock is intact we don't want sagging sheet rock we want sheet rock that feels dry as long as it's totally dry it out you can covered in seal it\nUh basically we treat mold on the surface of regardless of where it is in the house with a little Clorox in\nWater like one part Clorox the three parts of water and uh and just put it on you know you don't want to overdo it because you don't want to get the sheet rock to wet but just disinfect the area a with a with a sponge or re just to kill that mold and once it's done you you're steal it with a primer\nAnd ah and then re pain and ... you know the the proof of the pudding or the test for this is does the mold come back again and chances are it won't you know if if if we were doing this a radio show down in the\nDown south somewhere Louisiana and Mississippi or someplace we would treat mold differently because the Ambien humidity is so high down there that mold thrives and encouraged to grow but\nHere it's so dry that once you kill it and seal it it tends to behave itself and\nA and B pretty stable so yeah you want to a ... a little bit with just a little bit not a lot of don't so the sheet rock to kill the mold spray on some been a bull's eye one two three or\nOr the kills you know a couple of coast because that's a as a ... component will steal the mold away from the indoor air environment and it will seal the organic components so that the paint a won't it won't bleed through a when you re paint the surface\nSo two or three coats of of a primer cedar lake hills once that's dry a put on some\nPaint to match the existing finished and you should be okay as long as the as the leak didn't ... you know the the worst case here would be you had a skylight leak that went on and on and on for several months\nAnd so the insulation up in the attic and and so the uh the sheet rock a totally through where it was sagging and needs to be replaced but a little mold stain is not a big deal if you get right to it so you\nFix the skylight seal the mold and you can and and as I say the the test or the proof of you having done the right thing would be just the ... leak through or ... you know bleed through again\nAnd if that's the case you need to need to retreat at but generally mold can be killed and sealed and repeated a and it will go away pretty much permanently we'll be right\nBack real three seven three\nJoined in\nReturn every Saturday and eight thirty for the senior living today show show about seniors for seniors and move them on the love

out over what you have right now\nThis is just strictly at topsoil I don't think it has that much what you feel better to it yeah well I think she could shape when they were in there and kind of work and then with a lake\nOr something like that but if they're younger and younger\nYou like you'd normally fertilizer yard with Clinton and when he or she meant shy of that one too I thought\nWell I think as I remember and you can check with Assad company but they fertilize quite often those sawed farms and so there may be a a fertilizer might have been applied to the side that you're going to get\nRelatively a relatively recently so I Would let them worry about the fertilizing if you wanted to work in some organic now like some peat moss or compost or\nA sheep and Pete uh it's okay it's a little\nCan be a little hot sometimes you can as you say do it with a rake but I wouldn't worry about fertilizing I Would just put the side down for now and uh you're you're getting kind of late in the game here have you talk to Assad company about doing this\nSo cutting telling Freeh\nYes so I mean if you wanted to work in some organics now before they come find that I wouldn't worry about fertilizing I just put it down and I'd water it and and let it go with that yeah\nWell thank you so much\nYou got to hear from you thanks for thanks for calling\nSo yeah I mean I ... you can sometimes people can fertilized too much fertilizing of course in a new lawyer newly seated long can be a problematic because it can be fairly harsh so but the side company worried about that they will fertilized\nA timely enough or maybe a week or two before they cut the side and it'll be\nIt'll be fine so you know get that in and hopefully you'll get a\nWet snow or two which is perfect for a new

back instead of how\nHow uh how new is your house or how old it was built in the nineties and ... was gone from a dry wall residential drywall\nProducts in a in the late seventies we we think that ah roughly\nA Seventy eight has the date we use for lead paint and especially this was pretty well gone by then anyway so anyhow spilled let's say in Nineteen eighty or new or\nWould not have a ... just would not have lead paint for sure so I don't know I mean I I don't know a state law that would require a newer home like yours built in the Nineteen nineties to have a ... testing so now you've got to repair the damage that they did some of these folks just need to bone up on things like\nLike housing dates and eras of what what was used when you know from the seventies and the earlier lead paint was very common\nAs was his best isn't drywall taping products them and even in the texture products and so you have to kind of be careful if you're in an older home when you remodel you want to make sure you keep things damp\nAnd uh if you're going to scrape off any drywall material like acoustic ceiling which I don't recommend by the way that's another that's another topic but if you're going to have any drywall products in a house built in the from the late seventies or earlier than you want to keep them ... keep them well contained all the same with lead paint\nBe careful when you remodel when you're scraping when you're saying is so on\nA so I'm\nA I let it go with that I Would not worry about a house built in the Nineteen\nNineties thrill three seven one three eight to five

o'clock thrill three seven one's three Haiti's Bye bye Jo in Colorado Springs listening on the already Oh hi Joe you're on the air good morning\nOr anything you can end of this month a professional is going to blow up the external underground sprinklers and dreaming inside sprinkler quite\nWhat should I use to insulate the outside above ground exposed quite which breastfeeding any pressure valve\nWell nothing if he's going to drain the water out of both ends of the system than those pipes won't have any water in them\nA because virtually all sprinkler systems are set up to have a drain on the inside in the utility room of some kind and one on the outside of that sprinkler manifold box and so he when he opens both of those uh Joe it it'll let area in both ends of the pipe\nIn that water all dribble out you're going to be fine Yeah Yup okay now now is he going to blow your system out\nYeah I've got a it's a it's a great I'm Glad you called because it's a great segue I was going to spend\nFive minutes or so here talking about uh the my views on blowing out sprinkler system so you can hang up and uh and listen to that but uh in your particular concern to your question a there'll be no water in the pipe anyway OK\nOkay thank you\nGood glad you called thrill three seven won three to five five by the way I Want to reset the show where the fall um show sustainability expo in the springs a power parking academy we open attempt today tend to six\nEleven deal for tomorrow by the way insulation it's interesting show you asked that question insulation only works if there's heat on one side and cold on the other so if you just simply wrap your sprinkler place with insulation\nA buy themselves out there in the in in the air than the cold weather comes the insulation and the pipes will uh both get cold so the insulation is only good if there's warm temperatures um on one side so that you can retain those warmer temperatures so I wouldn't enslaved the pipes anyway\nMy view on blowing out sprinkler system as I said we don't we talk about this every year is it in most cases it's not necessary modern sprinkler systems\nAre piped with that shiny black polyethylene of the sprinkler pipe the uh out in the yards the zone valves feeding all the various heads in the yard and they are fairly forgiving of cold temperatures I haven't blown up my sprinkler system in decades and I'm I'm been just fine the pipes that do freeze\nOr the exact pipes that Joel was asking about those manifold pipes on the outside of the house they're usually copper or maybe white PVC or both\nAnd they're hard stiff pipes that crack a at a moment's notice when the water expands upon freezing\nDown to it when we get to about twenty seven Fahrenheit or below is when you really have to really have to worry so I'm not a I I just don't think blowing out a sprinkler system is\nA has a good return on investment so to speak and I don't think it's desirable and I don't think it's helpful because you do need that went through water we have we've been having drive\nA relatively dry warm winter's\nOver the last several years and\nWe just uh which we just\nDon't need\nTo drag hoses around but we do need the water every three weeks or so you have to water the law in the bushes the the the bulbs under the under your garden and so I think it's a good idea to to winter arises sprinkler system but that's different from blowing it out by one to rising I mean protecting\nThe pipes that are are most vulnerable the copper and PVC pipes are that are on the side of your house and you can do that quite easily by opening the the valves\nOr by turning the water off first of all through the whole system of course and then opening the drain valves in the house and uh on the uh outside of the house in that sprinkler box once you open both of those\nLittle faucets or drains we let air and both ends atmospheric pressure the water dribbles out and we're fine\nI'll tell you what a winter water and if we have no precipitation you simply reverse the process on a nice warm day turn the sprinkler system back on and do your winter watering and then turn it off in the ... winter rises again so\nIn most cases I don't think we need to blow out the sprinkler system because then you don't get an opportunity to water water all\n... for the next six months or so\nBut in the meantime if you'd you know if you see the lawns extra dry you have to drag hoses around you have to separately water your flower gardens and young trees and Bush's other flower gardens that most homes have\nBulbs that are wondering the Irish plants and tulips and daffodils and so on they needed a drink of water also as do rose bushes a on a in a in a dry winter so I'm not a big fan of going out a sprinkler system unless it's an old fashioned system where all the pipes out in the yard are steel or PBC or maybe\nA in an extreme cases copper but if there's just normal polyethylene plastic\nBush that black shiny sprinkler pipe just let it go don't blow it out but winter rise the vulnerable pipes on the side of your house if you have some comments on that we'd love to hear from you some feedback thrill three seven one three eight to five five is our contact line and a live email this morning at a rally\nI was wondering you have anybody you recommend around my area that get to work and what they are the metal duct work back up in their\n... listens there's nothing wrong with flex duct work if it's insulated uh it\nThat it's not insulated that\nYeah well a\nPlastic then at the end matter of fact that it had a few old then at night I had to go up at all I was wondering why my house with an eight hundred or a little a eight hundred and fifty square foot house and sometimes my winter gas bills over two hundred dollars a month and it's ...\nListen in most places it's not legal to use non insulated duct in the attic by the based on the energy codes that are available so he did not do you any service I Would um I Would not go back to the metal ...\nOr ... I was gonna ask you a question I Would not go back to the metal duck thing I Would uh have someone come and put insulated flex duck thing in the addict because the labor costs will be a lot less so they called us it's usually black and shiny black\nA plastic covering it insulated and then there's a flex interior metal flex interior\nFor so I just simply have them replace the non insulated flex with insulated flex and I think you're going to be fine so I appreciate your call in the spring will start to Gary good morning Jerry you're on the air I\nMean good morning\nHave a simple question about re as light switches yes uh I had the touch type and I also had a slight type as both types are getting worse\nOh hot to replace the one that was again hot but it's still in\nWell war okay my view on these is it warm as okay hot is not and you you need to check the water Jews of the total number of watts of the light bulbs in the circus and compare him to the waters of the Denver itself\nSo warm is fine I'm One of the ways that you could help radiates the heat is to buy metal switch covers instead of plastic\nOr you can buy a ivory colored or white or whatever color you have in a in metal I think it's aluminum\nI'm not sure about that but his metal so it will help get rid of that he so warm find hot not fine check the waters and you don't want to be within about eighty percent of the waters in other words\nIf you're if you're ... Denver\nDon't get any more than a what eighty of of six is a four hundred and eighty stay stable that eighty percent value or go to the next hire them or\nWater which uh because that's usually the problem with these when they get hot you have too many light bulbs and its overloading the Denver but get medals which place again warm okay hot and not okay I Hope that helps you Gary we'll be right back up the sustainability exploiting the springs we open at about five\nMinutes here at Palmer park an academy in Colorado Springs event center [noise]\nDamn apparel and being and play on the U.S having to use your money where the miracles are\nGive to your children's you're on that one\nNinety case yes for the call home showing the springs fire work at a gathering of the events that are interesting bills we open them in a\nForeign minister so in the meantime let's go to Ron in Gillette, Wyoming Ron good morning you're on the air Hi\nGood morning a real quick question here around my property I've noticed I have acquired\nThrough Europe for a large piles about the size of the Bush will basket and our little boy I tried to decide how to get rid of them I thought about four years he already shutting fire but at the fires bridge there certainly are [laughter]\nYeah no I Would uh you know that we're getting to the weather now where they're going to become sort of dormant anyway and um so what I Would uh I'd probably let things go you know for another week or two and then just get a shovel and spread of mountains and just get some some grocery store and killer\nTo spray or on whatever you know there's ... eggs in there and so on that just um you know once you spread 'em out and spray that poison on their list that set all winter up I don't think there'll be coming back so I Would probably not disturb them right now okay\nTill it gets a little cooler\nYeah and it's just spread of mountain boys and um and I think the I don't think they'll come back okay hey have a great day\nYou to appreciate it bill in Lakewood good morning you're on the air got about a minute and a half or so yeah\nWhat the heck is is there any way to eliminate you know when you turn the furnace on for the first time yeah at that older I I assume if the settling on the burn is something\nI don't think so unless you want to get in there before you fired up with your shop back and got a vacuum everything that you could see it get to a but no that's you know it's insect maybe there's some spider webs in there and who knows how to get in there and so and yeah\nAnd one room I have two twenty base bought heat is and then they do the same thing\nAnd it it's it's you get the same thing with gas a log fire places you know they said all winter getting full of ... and flies but who knows dust and so on\nSo you can't really help there yeah but again you got your shot back in ... poked around inside your furnace there'll be less of that I suppose huh so okay hey well thank you that's all right Bill thanks for your call bills or regular color and that's great to the program villain liquid\nUh so yeah that's it just comes with\nWinter on the way my furnace has already starting up I have a great Honeywell thermostat that's on the auto setting so goes the heat or cool whatever whatever's needed and my friend has already started I'm sure yours has also\nReminder of the get it clean makes sure is nice and clean\nFor and checked out and safety check for the coming winter heating season well\nThe doors are opening now at the Colorado Springs events that are ... to get to the rest of the kills we'd love to see what the ... the inability sustainability and outdoor living expo rope until they until six tomorrow eleven before we back after after the news with our number two around the house give us go I'm\n\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens\nWhen you called select quote life for example Georgia's forty\nHe was getting sky high quotes from other companies because he takes meds to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found him a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select what age and dance to be you know and believe me\nIf the liquid isn't shopping for your life insurance you're probably paying too much\nFor your free quote cult eight hundred five seven three Ninety five fifty to last eight hundred five seven three Ninety five fifty to eight hundred five seven three Ninety five fifty two or go to select ... since Nineteen eighty five we shop you save\nGet full details on the example policy it slowed down complex commercials or price could vary depending on your health insurance company in fact I don't remember when I was\nFive K. C. S. J. lo\nFive Ninety eight feet on your phone are you\nI'm Pam who sounds Fox News from the Supreme Court to Capitol Hill thousands of people are protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh hours before the Senate holds a final vote on his confirmation knock this year we can Turner is outside the high court\nIt would shut down the fuel supply and I don't think that's a good idea but that was the case the state senator voted for the bill and he says his house froze up because there was a false reading of carbon monoxide turned the furnace off\nSo it's funny how perspective change that would I Would that be in favor of that\nAh for reasons you describe it gets cold in Wyoming that it gets cold around here and I so I Would a carbon monoxide detector that has allowed alarm to wake you up and get you out of the house to call the fire department would be that the deal I Would not want one that was shut the fuel supply off with one exception\nThere are propane alarms if you're out in the country and a half\nPropane to fuel supply propane pretty dangerous insidious because this much heavier than natural gas tends to sink to the lowest places in the house like that\nCause space in the basement or if you get a propane alarm you can wire that into a valve\nThat will shut off the fuel supply to your house so if the detects if the sniffer smells propane fumes it turns off the gas supply which I think that's a good idea otherwise\nCarbon monoxide detector set up in the hallway sniff the air and if they sense carbon monoxide over a given period of time they will alarm\nSo I think that's a wonderful idea so somebody if somebody knows the exact current law in Wyoming about requirements for use and new homes that have carbon monoxide alarms give us a call three ... three seven one three to five five in the meantime in Montana\nOr going to talk to Jeff\nGood morning Jeff you're on the air Hi\nGood morning Ken I'm\nRehab temperatures up here I live about probably less than a hundred miles south of here as the crow flies huh um\nAnd so what are rising is pretty much after the up here but as I did research on that\nI found out that you have to be careful when you're when arising because I did not realize this but the plastics that are kind of rotate your driven mechanisms you are uh-huh or that they're actually\nCool by the water that goes through the plastic it's cooled and if you're a nose for any sense of period of time without water you actually run the risk of developing though they're not causing damage to your uh your sprinkler heads\nSo yeah I Know some folks like they get every last little bit of water out of there but uh you run the risk if you do that a actually a damaging your ...\nAnd you are reminding me thank you Jeff for your call because you reminded me of of the little tagline about winter rising sprinklers are not blowing them out a and I\nForgot to do this I'll do it now is it when I Do mine I I go to the my sprinkler control clock you know the little control system and I cycled through each\nHis own valve for about ten seconds each which relaxes the there's kind of a ... big rubber diaphragm or a washer inside it relaxes it and let's air into that valve and then I turn the clock off you the same idea if you don't want to leave your sprinkler clock on with no water because those valves\nAre electric and they have a ... and they do tend to over here so that's a good reminder yeah\nYup or do you know you're you're up in the cold country up there do you take it you don't blow out your sprinkler systems that what you're saying\nNo we do if you're if you're going out myself but one of the things that you're that another cycle a couple of times um the cool weather here so let us much of the water out as possible or when I bought I have less water to actually get out\nAnd it's it's amazing really how much of the water goes gets out all by itself without me having to do anything\nYeah I think there's some dribbling through a connections and vows and there's also some evaporation that occurs and so yeah I ... my theory is and I think this is such a kind of validated by the fact that they don't freeze is that uh if you were the rise your system\nAh and you know here in the next couple of two or three weeks\nA and then don't turn it on for a month or so to winter water in the meantime a lot of evaporation and will take place in a little bit of leaking so those pipes are less than half full of water enemy that's that and the fact that there are plastic is why they don't freeze because we're not totally full of water yeah\nRight I Am going to tend to any surfing is going to turn the water levels tend to go down to the lowest sprinkler head anyway so yeah I'm not saying they're going to drain anything for higher or so yeah it's a it's\nA pair of self and a lot of areas you know I when I Lived in Colorado Springs I that's what I uh\nI I followed your advice there up here I'm a little more reluctant to do that because the coke goes but\nYeah you and your ground freezes all your ground probably freezes all winter long doesn't it\nPretty much pretty much from the city is maybe not so much a food and that's the other thing is we are part of the Pacific northwest up here in West Montana and uh and so we don't get as much as Colorado ...\nYup there's a lot lower isn't it yeah it listen Jeff Jeff your regular color and I really appreciate your loyalty how long have you been up there and you left the springs you said how long you been up there\nAlmost three years now we were in the playoff or twenty five years but yeah I catch them do a listening to every Saturday morning and now you're you're part of my ... Saturday morning ritual\nI'm happy I'm Glad you called I'm Glad you listen Jeff thanks and and I'd love more feedback from you in future shows I always enjoy or\nOur conversation thanks a lot here speaking a sprinkler systems rich a at last some comments\nHis lawn is slow down the pipe strains of the lowest spot in the first couple of a heads up so now I blow up the system but you can ... that's a good comment\nYou can design a system with a little pressure vows that actually will dribble water out when the pressure goes away these are little ... if you have a an odd system like that word slopes down to the bottom at the bottom most part of each of those zones where the lowest head is\nYou can install a little pressure valve this kind of spring loaded and when the water\nPressure is activated when there's water in the line the valve closes shot when the water leaves like when you went to rise the system it it relaxes an dribbles water out so\nYou could design a system that will have automatic drains at the bottom of that hill if you want it to rich and and and that will help solve the problem okay thrill three seven one three eight to five five would be delighted if you'd call the program this morning we love to hear from you were at the Colorado Springs expo or Vince center\nAt the fall expo sustainability and after living expo presented by old world roofing and we have some tiny houses for a look at and some sustainability\nA demos and seminars today so come on by the doors are open today 'til six tomorrow eleven before I'll be right back right here\nOn around the house\n[noise] ... every Saturday and either for the senior living today show show about seniors seniors and the moment you'll come or topics leading down\nIndependent and overall wellbeing of seniors right here in southern Colorado\nYou're living in my senior living today Steve rarely Saturday morning and he only won by nine ...\nNine Ninety KCBS Jane marketer he went to reach everyone adults teens millennials\nBut it's not like these groups are hanging out in the same place right actually run their own right here listening to radio commercials just like this one radio ... connect to Ninety three percent of Americans every week and that's where the Google and Facebook\nTV and radio reaches twenty percent millennials thinking one more than people you want to go in one place when it gets I our media down\nAnd get a and that and working for years [noise]\nSo I just discovered gasoline dot com totally addictive new jewelry sidling big name luxury brand and you know which ones I'm Talking to that unique designers can't find anywhere else only a fraction at the price and going back on gasoline dot com tonight\nFolks if your own land you're going to want to listen to this my good friends had Mahendra may have\nThe best Mahindra tractor dealer I've ever seen for a limited time get them a hindrance e max twenty S.

I get questions should we covered the central air conditioning condensing unit at this time of year should we shrouded\nA or not and I can go either way on the ice shroud mine I have a a a sheet plastic cover\nI Can't remember where I bought it and maybe Wal Mart or someplace like that by some bungee cords to go around the bottom and I shroud my uh my air conditioning condense or in the winter I go into the main paneled box\nAnd there's a thirty and break her in there and you have a probably a thirty or up to fifty a breaker for your AC turn that off so it doesn't accidentally start\nAnd then I go outside and I throw the shroud over the top but the bungee cords around the bottom a and a ... and by you know my condensing unit is I think it's about Twenty years old it looks great\nKeeps all the junk out from the winter wind is blowing twigs leaves around it keeps the ice and snow out now you want to let it breathe a little bit so you uh I I always I don't take the shroud right to the very bottom of the condensing it did I leave it up a couple of inches or so or to uh\nTo as I say let it breed them but moisture evaporate that gets perhaps get ... gets trapped in there but I think they look pretty or longer a and um they have self draining holes by the way so the ice and snow that gets in there and melts away can drain back out but", "year": "2018", "show_name":

before what keeps you up at night while\nI'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you'd does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at it and very they're very him priced too so you may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that\nBigger premium so then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option which may be Medicare Advantage and I think brandy can cover Medicare Advantage a little bit more on that side\nYeah and with with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lotta people that we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan a lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize if you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start\nAnd that penalty goes for life so it's kinda scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything altogether\nOr we kind of think about it as a Sean does it really well as a combination played at the Mexican restaurant where we we put it all together we put your medical your prescription and everything else all in one plan and it really covers everything under one umbrella\nSo when the chips are down we need to solve so we need to we need to solve you know this is I think this discussion is really good because I Know so little about it and I've said so many times this is a team sport\nYou know this aging thing is a team sport there's so many things that we don't know the island theory is the more you think you know the more you find out you don't know so you really need a a team of professionals around you um\nWe're talking with you man of brandy Johnson and Sean modest and uh and what I'd like to do is just quickly just cover if you if they've got questions on this subject and they would like to do to have some more information is there an office number that they can call you actually\nUm our office as we stayed at the beginning of the show is in Colorado Springs the best way to get a hold of Sean and I are on our cell phone okay and my cell phone number is seven one nine to three eight six three five five\nAnd Sean's is seven one nine to three seven four or five one night\nOkay and and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that that you face was families\nYou know you walk it into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming next I mean we we don't know what's gonna happen all insurance is or what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect\nYou and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nThe defense team yeah yeah because you're going to see things coming that we don't see\nHow that are still sort of amazed at how complex this whole this whole system is showing how 'bout you what ... what are some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think ... affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're going no ...

Fox News that I Am now that are ... has confirmed that journalists democracy Shelby was well heeled inside its consulate in Istanbul, Turkey ... is this playing reaction\nWord resident Trump says he thinks it's out and get a good first people that was an arrest you think some people that they allege freaked out and\nYeah I a friend of mine was buy a house and and the\nFactor or something they said they're all they kept playing them I mean I mean they had to have it all replace be several thousand dollars but then that another person said they had it in their house and now they were wandering gosh should I take all that out on about Twenty years old\nI read into it I'm sure you're familiar with it [noise] it really that you have to take that\nThat's a bad is it the Polly beautifully and you're talking about\nNo Petra ethylene\nYou know I'm not I'm not sure what that is a great it's great well the ... you know I'll go back ... poly doodling is gray and that's the stuff that we replace all the time it was maybe you might be right maybe I think it is ... and\nIt's it's a pipe that was with us from the late seventies till about the mid nineties your right to a twenty year old house it would be kind of unusual\nThat late to have this stuff well here's the deal is ... it was the first plastic water pipe and it was touted as\nJust the best thing since ice cream you know and we both thousands of homes in many many condos in an apartment buildings and ... and what we found is that the fittings\nWhere there's a tea or an hour would deteriorate from the chlorine in the oxygen in the water and they would react chemical and splitting the cause catastrophic flooding well there were a class action lawsuits to beat the band back in the nineties yeah uh the shell oil company which invented it was part of the one of the defendants and there were a bunch of others\nThose class action suits are gone now but to answer your question ... poly beautifully and has a lousy reputation with realtors appraisers home inspectors so if you've got it in your house it's probably a good idea to get a change\nFor me I had said also the insurance companies if they know you have it they will not sure you're out\nYou know I think that's true I'm not sure it applies to all homeowners insurance companies but that that like aluminum wiring I think that's one of the questions that many of these companies will ask and I think you're right because there can be you know it ages poorly and it doesn't get better doesn't stabilized and so the\nTheory is it'll eventually all of these houses will eventually flood and so it needs to be changed there are all kinds of companies around who have turned key operations that is the plumbers painters dry waters on\nOn staff so they just come in and usually in one day maybe a day and a half they cut slots in the drywall him in and replace all the plumbing or would not with copper but we used ... P. E. X. rays raised ...\n... okay something on line and this lady had our houses built liking Ninety four right at the end and then at Twenty years so I guess the crap\nWhile I was going to say one of the side bars on this is there are different generations of this stuff now the generation she probably has a has copper fittings if that's the best generation of all of that is what she has tell her there's no hurry\nOh yeah okay well yeah it's like\nThe ... the the early fifties were gray plastic and they were horrible\nOkay All right what\nYou gotta do to hear from you and yeah if you if you have probably be the lead piping list your home for sale chances are you're realtor we'll suggest changing it how much does it cost well it depends on how many with the configuration of your house if it's a rancher with across space would be the easiest\nVersus a two story where you have to go through the interior walls and depends on the number of bathrooms and we're the laundry is and there's a lot of lot of variables here but generally speaking you're looking at five to maybe a thousand bucks give or take for the change of policy doodling pipe probably needs to be done is one of those things like the\nFederal Pacific Electric panels that we've talked about they just eventually need to be done Peggy\nAs wading talk about a water heater hey how are you\nAre oh why oh why you All right what's going on today\nOkay well my L like shower hot water\nThat well it never got real hot hot hot or a kept try one when a shower and yeah ... ... ... ... ... ... ... and at that point\nAnd it got worse in the last week and a half and last night it was really it just in every every night it just gets worse\nThey ask I almost let me ask you know look I lukewarm\nBut it's not hot that I live and\nLet me ask you a couple of questions um how old is your house\nA two year old well it'll ... years old and they're\nAll right I think and I did the other fixtures in the house hot water was are they okay\nYes uh-huh else on the water gets hot hot and stays there\nYou may have an anti ... called a a a valve at your house that can be adjusted\nUh you have to sort of take the ... ... you know kind of expose the inside parts a two year old house would have a government mandated anti ... and they ... the plumbers are required to set the tabs at a place that you and I would never said it for ourselves 'cause you know those are nannies the watch over a day and night\nDon't want you to get scolded and they're worried about you and everything and so they set these scrawled tabs are so low that you just don't get a nice hot shower so if there is no disabled people are little kids in your house\nThat we use that shower or go ahead and adjusted you can change those tabs yourself so you get hotter and hotter water now I don't know if you can do this if you want to try yourself or if you can have a neighbor do it but it's relatively easy in most cases to change the tablet still deliver it goes farther and you get hotter and hotter water\nOkay well do I I Can't do it myself style thing you know elderly\nYeah we'll go to handy man or a plumber would man or a handyman you up\nA ... I don't have to call upon their right\nYou don't have to call a plumber for this show what the guy could what the guy can probably do is if you can look at the brand name of your shower a valve\nUm if

the\nSquare down by that I'm like\nYeah so did there used to be air coming through this or never\nYeah no they're they're and they're on their ... so yeah it's kind of a mystery\nYeah I don't I don't have any idea what's going on other than you could do a little experiment a at it and you could close off a start closing this isn't your bedroom level right so start closing off all the other ducts of their temporarily\nAnd turn that are in the sun and see if we can force a little air uh through their um the only thing I can think of Steve is that you have somewhere in that line is it do you think there's a flex ducked instead of hard metal or is it all hard sheet metal\n... it'd be hard at all um yeah I mean there's\nNo now flex stacking comes straight out of out of the ad a furnace\nThat set them that big box called upon them was 'cause I reason I ask 'cause sometimes those flex ducts can get a kink in him or collapse or something well I don't know this is a mystery but uh again try the experiment don't do it too long you don't want overload the furnace but\nBut blocked off a bunch of other ducks and see if it'll force air into that into your master bedroom ducked otherwise I Want you to call my buddy Brian it over an eagle crashed he does free phone consultations for my list are you in the Denver area\nAre not actually happened during your where are you know

odd thing to suggest but you could run a fiber optic TV cameras through their like you do\nFor sewer lines and that but that that's going to be kind of expensive so let me know how this turns out I

coming around the house good morning\nCan't I have two questions ... of the country just\nBefore the free and and note in October to second what I did I didn't have time to blow up my spank him so I just trying to pipe quite went outside to the men of ... and so the backup path that I wouldn't trade and now when I come home after\nBeing gone for Fifteen days I'm assuming that just barely crack it in the water on the refrigerator things I could have Erin or something because it get it we'll go to another\nFacet and turn it on and take it away\n[noise] why I don't know is there is is a squeal only with the ice maker\nNo no it's with any faucet for us who just slightly crack open it'll start squealing\nYeah I don't know if that's related to the sprinkler system or not ah I just don't know um there was this a new sound you haven't had before right\nOh no every time it seems like a drain down the uh the sprinkler system it seemed like it that happen\nHuh boy that's a new one for me I Would want to know one one of those things are always asking\nQuestions like similar to yours where there's noises random noises in plumbing systems is what the what your water pressure in your house or is it a too high to do that would be a symptom of too high a water pressure by the way you say it happens every time does it eventually go away\nYeah yeah yeah well\nI don't know if there's a relationship there and I suppose there could be we we wouldn't want to go back to the water or whatever the common elements are the the common elements to your sprinkler and the house plumbing which would be the water meter the pressure regulator yeah I'm not sure one thing you could try to do is the old stuff the scope test\nIs to get you can actually buy a cheap medical on line for twenty five or thirty bucks or you could use the blunt end of a screwdriver in your ear and I knew about that\nAnd just when the ... going on touch different parts of the plumbing systems starting in the utility room and see maybe it's the water meter howling or maybe it's the pressure regular but you can kind of isolated that way that's the best advice I can give you you said you had another incident\nThe second one that I have a circulation pump at one of those a lot about with a\nTimer on the hot water heater yeah I never knew what that for\nOh well that's easy it's to circulate to the hot water so that when you get up in the morning you had turned on your laboratory you have hot water right away without waiting\nFor it to come so you set the timer a you know Fifteen twenty minutes before you get up every morning it'll kick the pump on you'll have hot water right away could then you're not wasting water down the drain waiting for hot water you know what I'm saying\n... and save energy to right Oh absolutely yeah yeah anyway listening Brian thanks for the feed better now I'm sure I Hope she's listening that will help yeah and she can give you a call yeah right at a good way to get you to Brian thanks for your call All right Brian from eagle crushed\nThat's good advice we can do it a little experiment for a couple of days and see see that house Carl sent me an email he gets\nNeighbors user fireplace a lot and he gets a strong smell of smoke in his house and he's going to do to reduce or eliminate then and I follow through with Carl this is something I Want you all to uh to remember and think about\nUh the Carl admitted that his house I was I Can't remember when the house was built but it was in that era where we were obsessed by putting fresh air ducts into the house uh to\nUh to feed the furnace this was a result of the Arab oil boycott in the seventies where\nWe kind of panic because we started the ceiling almost overnight we started adding extra insulation extra cooking and sealing the houses and ah we ah had incidents of\nOf a carbon monoxide issues so the city code people say oh my gosh we're going to pass emergency rules and ordinances to add these fresh air ducts coming directly from the outside into the furnace system\nJust as combustion air for the furnace to make sure we have enough air\nSo the furnace and water heater can breathe well that's all well and good but these fresh air ducts in the wintertime are very cold makes the floor above cold in ads cold air to the system that really kind of waste energy a and they're just\nPeople don't like them and ... and in Carl's case\nIt's a the this sucks areas of the house into sucking\nOf films and smoke from his neighborhood ... from his neighbors fireplace so\nI told Carl to to kind of check that out\nTo ... ... talk to his HVAC contractor and see if he really needs that fresh air duct what we found over the years since all this has come and gone is that we can get enough air usually in most cases from inside the house\nSo we can eliminate these ducks altogether so we're not sucking brutally cold air into our furnace system which makes the house cooler and waste energy\nI don't want you to block these if you have one and these were\nPopular from the as I say the mid seventies or so when the Arab oil thing hit an energy prices skyrocketed we started\nUsing them then and they lasted all the way into the nineties now we don't use a ... at all I don't see them at all in the new homes because we\nDo get our air from in many cases\nInside the house so you simply put a Louvre door on the furnace room or cut some holes and put grills on them in the wall of the furnace ruin that sort of thing so you get all the volume of air this in the house circulating through the furniture for combustion era because when the furnace and water heater run they suck up oxygen when they\nCan bust the natural gas you got to replace that\nBut we find that when people come and go the windows are open people open the garage and come in and out there's enough fresh air in the house that we can take it into the furnace room to satisfy this and then we can block up these crazy\nCold air intake ducks the nobody likes and I don't want you to do it on your own I Do see people stuff rags in them without checking with anybody this is a needed safety issue the issue and\nSystem that's in the house for good reason she can't just willy nilly block up the ducks with a wash closet old rag or something without compensating someplace else to run this by your heating contractor and chances are they can recommend delivered door or something to overcome this you can block the cold air ducts often and are not sucking\nFumes from the neighborhood and not some cold air into your house okay thrill three seven one three eight\nTo five five we'll be right back right here on around the house [noise] [noise]\nMm hair part D switching to Walgreens may help you save on your Medicare part D prescription Walgreens trusted since Nineteen oh one talked to the pharmacist to learn more now back\nTo around the house with can moon on five Ninety case yes J.\n[noise]\nAbout five minutes before nine o'clock now let's get Christina on the line Christie good morning you're on the air coming around the house high\nOn your way of talking about eight and a question about the cold air returns uh-huh on I ... in Seventy two so most of our code to count on for a while you know put for any kind of like block\nUh-huh I like the area where a lot of is that how it got to work around at the gap where it wouldn't be blocked out what\nStyle of house do you have do you have a rancher what do you tell a\nStory yeah you you can uh it's relatively easy to take those apart and you can use the interior stood space you know between the dry\nWell it's kind of a channel to run the cold air return up to the higher level you know you can uh and that will you get kind of a cross ventilation other words the heat will come out of the floor registers and wander up to the higher the cold air returned yeah you sure can\nUh that's doable but remember you don't need a lot of room in front of those ... are crusty rather you just need a you know a couple of inches so like a sofa in front of him silver backs curve\nAway from the wall and so that's generally enough so you don't need a lot of space you know knowing that now that I've told you two or three inches can you rearrange your furniture to make them work or not really\nWell there's a little bit of faith in kind of an actual like everything furniture blocking it totally so there's probably gosh eight inches there so that that is completely open\nAir that's plenty that's okay I'm going to like\nHim is a with a two story we have a hard time like everybody does with a he or or a scene making it all the way upstairs you out of our basements breathing felt that Brian does he do that ... of the duct work and\nYou do sometimes you could bring in extra colder returns up to the upper level of a two story through the garage they run a duck straight up and into that second story is there a colder returning the upper story of your house now\nThere is there's one in my ... actually there's two there's one there right above and below each other on at the feeling on the floor\nWill have plenty of cold air return I really do I think a ... degree for Nineteen Seventy\nSeventy two house so I think you're fine when it comes to the air conditioning you're right it's hard to show that dance cold air to the upper story a couple of things we can do is a recommendations is having a ceiling fan and the upper hallway blowing downward in the summer\nTo show that hot air back down through the furnace also turning the furnace fans are always on when you get home\nFrom work and looked at thing wrong continuously all evening long that will help\nA with cooling also so it would be worse you know run to come over and see if you have enough\nA square inches or square footage of cold air returns we there's some minimum ... of the actual size of the cold air returns is sometimes we can put a bigger a bigger return in ... as he was talking you may have been listening a few minutes ago air flows everything\nThe writer we get through the furnished the better the furnace runs more efficiently and all the better cooling and heating their Russo or you might argue in the Denver metro area\nIn Littleton little to he could come by maybe a you know on a non uh emergency type basis and\nTo look at your

it yeah okay thanks for the call Janet sent me an email I just noticed one here's more furnished noises we've been talking about those a lot this morning I just noticed when turning on my furnace I hear a periodic banging I tried to go and see what it is ... and I think it's the kitchen sink dream which is close to the duct work\nAnd the thing I Do or should I Need to do I need to worry about it you know these furnished noises these random\nA creek and popping and snapping sounds when the furnace either when it comes on and when it goes off or both there's nothing really wrong or that you need to fix the reason we fix them is because of the middle of the night wakes people up in New wants to hear that but if this is annoys Janet you can live with\nThat I Would live with it I you know I don't know if you can get to your kitchen sink drain pipe but if it's in the kitchen and just happens occasionally\nI Would probably live with it rather than try to try to dig into the drywall and exposed to the duct work and the kitchen sink pipe if you want to though cut a little hole maybe in the basement other that kitchen sink\nYou could put a piece of wood or bone rubber or any ... a piece of Styrofoam anything that can kind of cushion between the pipe in the in the dumps work so\nUh I think uh I Would recommend the wood but or you can just simply bend the duct work a little bit with the big screwdriver and just kind of form it a little bit out of the way that pipe just so they aren't\nSo they aren't touching okay let's see here who's next uh Denise sent me an email we just had new doors installed I Want to have them staying should I be worried about the contract you're taking the doors down without damaging the hinge spins what kind of staying do recommend for wood doors do\nI think when you're going to stay in these stores I think you want to do it\nLying down you want to lie I'm On a lame down on the saw horse in the they're easy to remove and a A N and laid them down to the jams in the door casing itself which you don't remove of course that has to be said also\nSo you can mask off the hinges I Would probably recommended they remove the hinges altogether but whichever they prefer that can sure may I ask them what kind of stained or I recommend there's just so many kinds there's a\nThere's a one step product like the ... product is sort of a stain\nAnd and uh and the sealer all in one compound I think if if these are\nAdores that uh you know are their brand new and you want to treat them well the the real method of course on standing\nDoors and tremendous to use the ... and then lack or them so a black or his smelly and a little volatile and flammable so you might consult with the painting contractor if they want to use a one step or if they want to use the lack or don't use varnish of course\nBut any kind of a staying in the color you like a regardless of brand will do the job it's what you put on top of this thing that makes all the different so talk to your painting contractor about whether there should be lacquered or not or if there's a one step product that uh they recommend that has the\nThis finished the ceiling and ah\nAnd all of the garage circuitry is well grounded so if there is a problem that will manifest itself by kicking the break her off but the point is that lamp court\nA first seldom as I opened and closed the refrigerator door in the garage\nThat gentle a touch of the gas to get on the side of the door or touches the court doesn't do any harm or at all I feed it through there and plug it into my workshop uh electrical outlet and it just fine so\nI think that would be my recommendation for you to put a light bulb in the fresh food side of your garage refrigerator it'll be have itself than in this you know when the average temperature in your garage warms up in the springtime\nSimply unplug it and put it away for another season but it's coming in I haven't turned mine on yet but it's coming into that time of year when we return that light bulb on and leave it on\nTwenty four seven three three Seventy one three to five five right here on around the house give us a call in live email\nHere in

with this year a at a at the around the house dot com website somebody called off the air I took her name was Kathy a and said that uh we we didn't find out what kind of a light bulb or guy was using the Arthur that had electrical dimming\nA issues it could have been in a Catholic indicates she had an elite the light bulb is this the same kind of thing so yeah we don't have a C. F. L. L. E. D. I guess I always make the assumption made me made because I come from that era that as an incandescent light bulb but doesn't\nNecessarily have to be and I think we have a caller Jim\nWho thinks that may be also Jim you're on the air good morning\nI can are you\nDoing All right do you think it might be an ...\nI didn't get the hell okay I got I got one in my bathroom that does it right now you turn on the line and about ten seconds later goes down\nWell my see it was funny Jim I'm just the opposite my CFLs um ... my CFLs tend to start them and go bright so I don't know but if\nThey actually want to go on in your garage young in the wintertime I don't I mean he was not there anymore because they didn't bother me too much but yet I Do have one I did at one I have yet to change it but it is that the ball well\nAren't there if you're still listening I think the consensus is building here that put a regular incandescent bulb and there and then try the experiment in Seattle\nBut yeah there was a Mac rather than you suggest that some other collectors and they just get out of there and check it right at the socket yeah fairly\nYeah thank you Jim for your call Ben is on the line you thinks it might be electrical panels question bend you're on the air good morning hot morning and um\nWe bought our home in two thousand five at a ... roughly two thousand seven I was having the same problem with two or three different circuits and what it turned out to be in the black box on the circuit breakers\nAlmost all screws I could turn turn turn it to happen that solve the problem\nWow because those you know most electricians they really tighten those down is\nJust as tight as they can turn them with a screwdriver yeah he did say I thought I asked him and he said it was this was the only place in the house that does it but it's worth checking absolutely up check the panel make sure there's no lose connection sometimes they can be so loose band that there'll be blacks merges in there from overheating and so on so\nWhat what was happening with mind can wander the white first came out to the bathroom kitchen barely like ten Fifteen twenty seconds later they went damn yeah same thing just grabbing so it's got the I think a breaker\nSome kind of connection someplace right well this is thanks for that\nThanks for that feedback assure worth checking because anytime you have what they call a high resistance connection which is a kind of a gap where things aren't tight then you get sparking an architect and then you get a can potential fire so then I appreciate that feedback thank you for calling\nThrill three seven one three eight to five five got an email here from Andrew uh ... uh can I paint the plastic material have used for the flooring and top railing on my deck\nI

leave them alone and let them whether a naturally they don't tend to get along with paint very easily and I don't think it'd be satisfied so I Would just\nUh not paint paint the plastic composite

it today the snow will help\nCarry a deep deep deep into your lawn system\nTomorrow when it snows I told you I like the ritual on foreign relation with the iron you gotta get iron and fertilizer here in the Rocky Mountain so whatever your choice grabs the fertilizer do they get it down and then stand by as the as the snow comes okay winter rising sprinklers here's a\nHere's a just a typical email I got several this week\nPlease advise what we should do today to winter riser sprinkler without blowing the amount of charge you say not the blowout go over it because we got cold weather coming up we do and I will go over that now maybe in the next hour also\nUh so yeah I I I think we discuss this a little bit last week and we have this discussion actually every year at this time\nI'm not a big believer in blowing out sprinkler systems\nModern sprinkler systems usually can get by without being\nPurged with compressed air because we need to typically do when\nThere watering our winters in the last Fifteen Years or give or take have gotten really dry and the law you can get desiccated the roots can dry out and that's where that winter kill comes from\nA next spring so I Believe in the winter ... now you get a winner water if you want to dragging hoses frozen hoses around sprinklers or if you want to I don't like doing that because you don't get good coverage\nYou always there's always coverage lacking when you have a manual a sprinkler so I liked that winter water with my sprinkler system\nSo I Believe in the winter rising the system but not in blowing it out\nAnd what do I mean by that and we'll look oppressed errors service will blow all of the water out of all of his own zone valves and the and the hedge themselves so the system is pretty well totally dry and you this theory is you believe it that way until next spring\nWould I like to do is to turn the water off when it's going to get cold outside my water office is off right now when it gets cold out turn the water off in the house and the utility room typically\nA and a and there's a little valve I have next to my shut off that I opened that drains the water out of that pipe that I go outside and there's a single valve like a little Fawcett but I open up to that\nDrains water from the outside piping we get air and both ends of the sprinkler system and it's all said the pipes that our vote vulnerable we have now protected those at the heart pipes they're either copper or BBC or a mixture of both actually that are hard pipes and they're very vulnerable to freezing\nAnd when the temperature gets down below say thirty degrees or so the\nThe maximum expansion of frozen water is around twenty seven Fahrenheit but when it gets down in the mid thirties overnight\nYou need to turn that sprinkler system off because it could be mid thirties at the airport and low thirties or high twenties if you're in a low spot in your particular town so protect the pipes on the outside of the house\nThe hard pipes that really can freeze\nThe sprinklers own valves in that green box during during those this should be a matter of turning two maybe three valves or on the ... the the main valve inside you turn off in there the other voucher turn on the air and it with the water dribble out and you're all set and the reason is that the modern sprinkler systems are piped\nWith that polyethylene black shiny pipe\nOut in the yard zones themselves\nThe spike is fairly flexible so even if there is a little freeze up or or maybe some slush that forms inside the pipe the pipe can absorb that expansion and be OK without breaking are cracking\nA generally speaking if you turn your sprinkler system off after a few days the pipes are full of water anyway because you get some natural drainage leakage of evaporation so those pipes out and they are they're just trying so you're all said and you want to rise the vulnerable pipes that come out of the house\nAnd the zone valves themselves and just wait and if we get\nA dry winter like we've typically had the last uh last few years then for weeks or so three or four weeks on a warm Sunday afternoon maybe during a bronco game you can run outside and and water your yard you just simply reverse the process during those little valves off during the main water supply on\nAnd in turn your clock on your sprinkler clock and just cycle through the zones and there's your winter watering this is especially important if you as I Do if you have a zone sprinkler zones in your flower beds I have\nA flower bit of flowering perennials in front of it has a few bulbs in it some uh some day lilies and and it's got irises and out back I have to look and\nDaffodils and allium and things like that the bulbs underground or you can't really see right now they need a little water a drink of water occasionally young bushes young trees and your garden and general rose bushes also if you can arrange to have those winter watered every month or so in the winter season that's a good deal so underwater it's a big deal around here\nBecause the ground doesn't you know and listen to the grounds frozen you can't winter water but generally speaking the ground is

bone up sprinkler systems yeah and just curious what pressure I have a hundred and ten or hundred quite town a compressor\nA and I'm curious about what assure you what you just don't\nI don't think it matters that much stand up I don't I wouldn't a hundred and twenty sounds a little high to me is can you regulate the pressure\nThat's what I'm Wondering I'm ... I can regulate it what should I what should I regulated down to\nWell I was going to say it it it it matters less what the pressure is it matters more just to make run it until the water is gone because the water will eventually be purged out\nSo I Would I Would want to be down around Seventy five or so give or take because that's the kind of the pressure we run and sprinkler systems a hundred and twenty pounds or you don't want a blowout fittings or you know you know clams that might be a little loose or whatever so I'd get a down below that why are you going to blow it did you hear my little by little\nA kind of monologue about not blowing up sprinklers\nYes I'm the first year I um didn't bowed out I have white quite underground old and you had blow it out yeah a lot of guys are ... a ... a spring\nYeah I think I did say that will galvanize Steeler PVC piping underground you have to blow 'em out yeah okay\nThat's what I Am now on the white or\nWhen they started how many days would take to do it because like I said all I got one bathroom\n[noise] yeah well as long as you know you are you just doing your shower at your shower tub is that all you're doing\nNow I Want to do the the whole thing I Want to get a smaller vanity and make it more compact 'cause it's a small bathroom anyway uh-huh his lot because I'm older now and I just want to safety wise to\nYou want it to convert your shower to a ton of is that what you're saying\nNo uh\nShower or ... I thought okay I misunderstood you up to our\nYeah that's fine well listen as long as it is this is your only bathroom there'll be aware of that and they'll keep the toilet in place a till the last minute\nAh and then you know if you're going to replace the toilet I mean that's just a simple on and off kind of thing so long as you have a toilet for a few days and you can get along listen most companies should be able to do this once they get mobilized and get all the\nTile on site and all the parts they need and maybe the shower enclosure and so in a two or three days would be my\nGuest to do a good job so the one day company I don't know I guess it's possible I Would want to look at their ratings on line to see how happy other homeowners are with them is for I don't have a\nSpecific referral for you but what part of town are you and you are in West Denver west Denver you know if somebody's listening this had this done before remodeled bathroom and it was really happy with the contractor will put their name on the air if they want to call and otherwise I go to my website around the house dot com there's a\nThere's a blog area there for Denver small contractors I might start picking the through those names and see if you find anybody in there that this looks like they've done this before it's something they enjoy doing and uh and uh I I ... I see your concern\nWith only one bathroom but the main the main obstacle will be the toilet but you can arrange to have that changed really quickly and stuff is the main thing is the tub in the shower so it's you know when you when you're going to make this conversion is a little uh it's complicated because there's so many trades involved\nThere's plumbers and ... people drywall or isn't famers and carpenters there's just a lot of different trades involved in so that that's what drags it out a little bit I mean finishing the drywall alone or unless you cover it all with tile the new drywall will take two or three days to float and tape\nBecause at the drive between coach and that sort of thing but you could discuss this with a contractor but make sure you get to and even the three bids is good because this these\nPrices can vary a lot\nBased on how busy the contractor is sometimes they'll shoot you a high number because they're really busy but if they get the job they make a lot of profit so I Would shop around and the the one thing I Need to run to a break but the one thing I Want to leave you with more than anything else\nThat we've talked about this twenty five years now in the program and that is the homeowner referrals Internet ratings are okay as far as they go I don't totally trust them but homeowner referrals\nYet the names of the last couple of homeowners they did the ... similar work for and call him any company that's worthwhile that is proud of their work should be willing to give you share the name of owners with you that they've done this work for and just talk to them and that's the best\nReferral of all and the best recommendation of\nHomeowners just like yourself good luck Paul let us know how it goes we'll be right back real three\nTo Ben in Aurora good morning sir how are you a good morning I'm drier than it goes up the rough it important to claim that out or not or the boat to blow dryer\nYeah ... well actually a drier events the vertical and there's more and more of those because the rules on the length of drier events that are allowed have changed\nIn many builders find that they just have to go vertical to meet the rules yeah they require cleaning out probably more often than horizontal or does it you know I have my rule of thumb is spending your clean out your vertical drier than twice a year and maybe once a year for horizontal\nThe good news is you don't really need to do much to assisted what'll happen\nBecause of gravity Ben is the is the material will rise up into that pipe and kind of collect and then fall back down some vertical drier events tend to accumulate everything at the bottom of the event itself so if you move the drier back\nUh you'll see a clumps linked in there that you just suck out with your shop that they don't tend to accumulate Lynch a an ... of them on the event in the upper end a nearly as much as horizontal Stu now\nYou know maybe every couple of years or you might want to go up there with a ladder or has the hire somebody and pop that cap off to look for any accumulation up there but it will be mostly because of gravity at the bottom behind the drier\nSo I Would look at that twice a year yeah\nYeah that makes sense and I really appreciate it\nYou got it good to hear from you yeah dry urban clean outs important uh you know there have been and thankfully very rare instances of fires caused by plugged up Dr events the Lincoln catch fire it's as I say quite rare and thankfully\nBut you don't want to do accumulate for safety reasons and because it takes longer to dry your clothes\nAnd the effects are very gradual\nYou know you might have been able to dry a load of\nOf T shirts a a year ago in uh in in twenty five minutes and now takes\nForty minutes and you don't really notice the difference but trust me it's costing you more electricity and most of us dry with electricity which is the most expensive energy source or at all more the more expensive between uh you know if you've ever have a chance to get a gas drier they're much more energy efficient\nAnd require much less money to dry given load of clothes but nevertheless you want to clean the drier than out at least once a year\nThe way to do it with a traditional horizontal drier event is to go outside take the vent cap off outdoors and lay it to one side and then put a leaf blower\nOr on the on the drier end of the events and just blow all that lent out in the end of the yard and you can catch it was on some plastic or in a bushel basket or something and\nUh and there you go it's it's a very efficient way to clean out your dryer one end to the other to important\nOnce a year at least check it and then once in a while I just say this you got to the front of the drier off because Lincoln accumulates inside the drier as well if you go to Youtube video of how to do that it's quite easy\nTo take very long or you can also take care of your drought we'll be right

Wilcox concealed\nThat's where I think this law crack as is and the weather window hats and as an accent that I Can't tell where it actually you know\nWhen you say accent ... a piece of sticks out\nLike a coral or or yeah okay very good yeah\nAnd I think that ... that is yeah here on to the wall to give it for ... and then ... ...\n... that's a great description yes well is the first thing to do as you indicated to go inside to make sure every little little tiny Nick and crack and and you know to the stress crack\nA is totally sealed with a good acrylic exterior silicon iced acrylic talking a and then step back and see the answer your question stucco or a mold a issues with stucco\nOr it's not that they're common but once you have um they're hard to repair and they're very insidious because you don't notice them for a while now they are after system\nA is more vulnerable I think because there were you may have read or heard about all the class action lawsuits especially on the east coast from improper installation of windows doors decks and so on if you're a traditional stucco\nA cock everything and then stand back and see what's going on otherwise we may have to\nWhat may have happened is they may not have slashed the window properly\nOr wondering and they're very specific ways like for instance the vertical pieces go on first and the horizontal and it's it's very it's a step by step thing is very specific\nTo keep water from getting behind the wall and they may not have done it properly in which case you'll have to remove at least the corner of that decorative element uh that uh the other we call it a pop out sometimes up and up may have to remove that and see what's going on behind their okay so\nI said I Am thinking as if they pull that off at ... than I can do that um and then look at the window and that's how I get in there and Koch everywhere and around before we put that back\nOn did I misunderstand you or did you say you're going to have this window replace now\nAround the asking outlets sixteen thousand that we would like to avoid that yeah but I think that people will say out the window has to be replaced in order to fix the water lake in our ship the faith that before we have to read\nYeah but you say your link is a very pinpoint very specific place I Believe it is\nYeah if that's the case I Would just concentrate on that start with the cooking and uh in in in and go from there but there may be some issues going on behind their particularly in that top corner that window where they didn't uh properly flash would that when we used to that sticky ice and water shield tar paper star at\nJust the flash with yeah but there's as I say there's a very very strict protocol on how to install that will go outside of the today's a good day moderate get get that done try to do it today and and then you\nYou know how you tell the difference between ... and a real finance\n\nWell like I could do you are you going to tell me or should I tell you know I mean for oh\nOkay [laughter] okay well generally speaking if you go outside where the bottom of the ... is\nA ... you can get a little mirror look there's what we call her we screen it's a piece of metal that is like A L shaped lip that has some drain holes in it and that's that's a given away for a for traditional stucco also expansion joints\nIf every ten feet or so there's a vertical kind of a metal expansion joined that sometimes is a ... that's a wonderful indication that is traditional stuck oh yeah okay\nOkay All right All right well thank you can\nTake

have a wonderful winter and be able to to ah make a joyful recovery and re grow in the spring so fertilize right now today good I'd good time to do that\nLet's see um [noise] and I'm doing a here's an email from Laura said Mr dino\nIs highly recommended nice guy I'm uh just um of recommend them highly so thank you Laura for that appreciate that that he has an interesting question um she has sewer gas in the house I think you discuss this before but what do you do to limit to eliminate the smell of sore gas in your house I have and use the washer\nFour months in the basement really started to smell ... is a dangerous when you to call a plumber uh no I mean it's listen ... gas is basically methane and hydrogen sulfide and it can be dangerous in high concentrations that's why people that worked on and sewer lines and so on were breathing equipment but\nIn the small concentrations in your house it's usually not dangerous or a problem it just smells and it's very irritating and a an off putting if you will so yeah it's usually easy to fix usually comes up\nThrough floor drains or tubs or showers are laboratories that you don't use very often all plumbing fixtures have a trap underneath sometimes you can see the trap like under the bathroom sink and sometimes you can't it's hidden under the basement floor but the traps usually full of water\nAre in the water is that makes a seal and keeps us or gas from coming into the house will if you don't use a floor drain and most of us don't it just the water just evaporates and lets the sewer gas in and you can simply poor more water and if you'd like floor dreams are usually you say your basement laundry\nIs smelling we'll that's typically work for drain is down there so you can dump a a a ... half a gallon of water in there once a week if you'd like the other answers to use of mineral oil mineral oil is a light oil that will sit in the trap and not evaporate but it'll\nBe pushed out of the way of water gets into the trap but nevertheless mineral is a good thing to seal the trap with relatively permanently\nSo that settles that floor drain issue it should be somewhere near the furnace or or water heater Betty in your house and once you pour the men are loyal and they're the smell will tend to go away unused drains like maybe your laundry you're not doing laundry\nOften as you used to you said the showers tubs\nLaboratories that maybe for guests only don't could use very often need to run water and those about once a week to keep the surrogate smell out of the out of the house and also flush those toilets at least once a week and unused bathrooms and that's kind of the story to keep the odor out of your house All right let's talk to\nUs to talk to a gym in Westminster good morning Hi how are you\nCan't how are you today I'm doing well what's up with you and with all\nDue respect or I just don't recommend that you tell people not to blow up the sprinkler systems because you know with me work and what these things for the last Thirty years uh-huh I got to France or with people for years and now my next door neighbor\nUm highly or where she did I mean you use as a solar shot and now that we're talking five thousand dollars for a redo [noise]\nBut they are all depends if you know your sprint consistent how deep it is ... material this\n... thing comes in two different uh pressures that comes in eighty PSI and a hundred you saw it in a law that might matter but you also got them plastic veterans in there that are\nAnd you're out there that can break but I met during exactly what you're suggesting as far as uh you know like a pre you know I'm a pressurized fishing\nYou know that's you know this you know there's a quick for is coming up and that would certainly what you are saying you know my American press route to blow it out\nYeah I think I don't know I I you know listen I'm Jim I'm not here to say that it it it never going to have you can never have a problem but
