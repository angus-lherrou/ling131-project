you for that [noise]\nAll right I just loved technology when it can have a positive effect on our lives and heart disease and stroke a church two of the biggest causes of death worldwide now imagine\nFor a moment that you can get a warning that you were going to have a heart attack years before the event ever occurred that's right well\nThanks to technology developed by teams at Oxford University and institutions in Germany and the United states\nThey now are using algorithms to examine the fat surrounding coronary arteries as it shows up on the tea hearts scams now most heart attacks are caused by a buildup of plaque fatty deposit inside the artery interrupts the flow of blood so currently the CAT scans tell a doctor when an artery has already\nBecome narrowed by plaque well that's the problem\nThey say now that they can figure this out even before develop they can say which arteries are the risk of narrowing they can say that your arteries are inflamed\nAnd what's

[laughter] okay [noise]\nI actually thought that was funny [noise]\nAll right this next story is not for the kids so if you have kids that are listening to the Kim commando show time for them to cover their ears or you wanna mute the television if you're watching the game commando show there mute the radio if they're in the room as long as they're clear we're good to go or at your ready\nGood there's a dark side of technology that a lot of folks are brushing off is the use of robots for use in how do you say intimate situation things that happened between two people\nJust like there are those gentlemen clubs where someone might pay ten dollars for a poll dams and those ranchers branches in Nevada where prostitution is legal the city of Houston was wrestling this past week with how to deal with the company that wants to open up a brothel filled with robotic sex toys that's right\n[noise] they wanted to open a love dollars brothel and a huge soon so that people would be able to use it\nHuman like dolls a kind of sad that it sounds familiar it was in that movie west world Houston remains the only major U.S city without zoning construction of the site for the proposed robot bravo had already be good\nBut it was stopped after the city inspectors visiting location and they figured out that the business owners that they didn't have the proper permits [noise]\nSo Houston's city council actually updated the local audience to specifically banned individuals from having sex with a device that resembles a human being [noise]\nOkay I Know what you're thinking maybe the city council couldn't ferret away to tax the robots but those of us here at the Kim commando show a we have come up with the perfect name\nFor that how about a Sears and Roebuck yes Sears and Roebuck yes okay [noise] okay the kids are back and let's talk about selfies research out this past week that death by selfie is on the rise\nAn average of forty three people a year have died while taking selfies and the year two thousand eleven drowning and falls are the biggest killers\nThe studies show that men account for seven of the ... fatalities millennial daredevils those between the age of twenty twenty nine make up almost half of all self the death so here's what's going on\nLegislation politicians are getting together and coming up with no selfie zones so it's right to say\nYou're going to have no selfie zones near water bodies mountain peaks tall building a U.S woman died on a highway accident just seconds after uploading a selfie of herself singing happy on her car stereo\nOr there was a ... a young Mexican guy killed himself he was posting with a selfie with a gun next to his head\nA a tie woman was hit and killed by a train this past spring she was wanting to take a picture of herself and her friend on the real tracks\nBritish woman Louis she's thirty seven her partner Michael thirty three they fell about sixty feet to their deaths after topping off a beach wall so now we need these no selfie zones or maybe it's just the latest crop of the Darwin Awards and we may see that's it\nBut if you think about it on a positive way at least they had a refund had shot for the funeral mhm\nAnd finally be careful what you search for online we were talking about this before the show\nBecause I read the headline and it said ruby rose is the most dangerous celebrity to search

not the best idea okay I was a dummy\n[laughter] okay and you are still using their password that that if I were with you I Would just like you know slap you right across the face for doing that because you need to stop using their password okay\nNow what ... what's happening in is that these uh hackers are getting hold a username and password and then they are crafting these emails in in a classic sex extortion scam\nOr you don't want to pay them they really won't go much further than this they may send you another email but don't feel beholden to actually give them any type of

next Google update is one that you might want to pass along to your family members and friends who say they've been working on a brand new product that lets Android users control their device using only their voice\nIt's been a beta a really long time two years but this past week Google started releasing the global aids called voice access allows you to write text\nTalk to the Google Assistant navigate using your voice oh so you can click buttons and other things just with your boys\nOne's voice access is activated you see numbers next to everything so if you want to issue a command you'd

Android device you can now do with only your voice you can download\nVoice access through Google Play [noise] coming right up and just a few moments where five route or security settings to turn on before it's too late and then later on\nThis hour the things that you should not be even thinking about buying as far as technology goes in the month of October but back to the phones me go with Nick in ... Washington [noise] either Nick\nHow are you I'm good what's going on [noise] um\nI've been looking into some money making apple um the ones where you can earn money watching movies and TV shows or share your online shopping received so\nI'm Wondering if these are legitimate abs or if they are maybe inviting trouble phone ... possibly viruses are now where\nAre you know it's all those are all really good question um how much money are you trying to make or would you like to make\nA\nLiving you know on a book extra months\nOf ... so it's not like you're like OK I Need to make a thousand dollars were you know two thousand dollars or anything like that or a you know some of the ap she mentioned like swag bucks is the one that let you watch TV Shop kick is the one that you know let you cumulative points for shopping\nUh there's I pull this way it's something that allows you to take surveys a Google also has their opinion ... that will pay you one dollar per survey\nYou know if you wanted to make like\nA couple of hundred bucks a month that may be the way I was in costs go a couple of weeks ago\nAnd I had a put TaskRabbit on my phone 'cause one of these apps right um 'cause I just figured you know as testing it out and then when I got to Costco came up and says hey you know we have a task Rio and so I figured you know what\nMight as well I'm Wondering how stuff works right\nAnd so it asked me to go over and take a picture of the the downy fabrics oftener and ... and and how much is being sold for at that particular Cosco so I took a picture and sent it off through the app and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the absolute illegitimate apps is that you don't have to worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com gift card\nOr a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like one's called folk\n... pie that you could take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various um agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that way\nThere's Moby and it wants you to go to a particular business and then take a survey about the business [noise] uh there's field agent which is just like TaskRabbit there's diet bet if you want to lose a couple of pounds right\nI ... you can place a bet that you're going to be and you participate in this you gotta weigh yourself and all that other stuff\nAnd but the average take home for a month is like sixty bucks their sweat coin okay for every thousand steps you can get a point nine five sweat coined that will be translated into like an apple gift card their surveys on the go there's just a whole bunch of 'em but\nUm they these are the ones that I mentioned are legitimate there's probably some some that are not legitimate\nBut what I can do is direct you to the list of legitimate money making apps over my website does that help you out\nTo cook or someone to feel it\nOh it does and then when you and like most people nobody reads the terms and conditions on any of this stuff so

happy apple surgery and Google's assist ... using the sounds of birds chirping\nManipulated in a way that only the microphone on your smart speaker or your smartphone can pick up an attack can bypass detection from the human ears and then start causing havoc\n[noise] so the researchers say that the attacks you psycho Cusick hiding to master true intentions and so this bird chirping or something that is some audible could be hidden inside of commercial that plays on television or the radio and had thousands of targets that was\nAll right so you're like okay well it hasn't happened yet but when it happens how to protect myself well there aren't a lot of security settings and smart speakers that the problem I mean you put a pin on your Alexa or or you can just turn it off we're not using it but the researchers say that this is possible and they fully expected that happen within the near future\nAnd speaking of attacks\nIt seems like anyone who I meet they always want to tell me how

east west grab use whatever it may be to have you got nothing to do this weekend you're on Google just to go ahead and go with the term text adventure\nAnd this story caught my attention over a ... security crazy story that I have to tell you about how voice\nFishing scams are getting more clever I mean we just heard about a fishing scam with a check well what about if somebody called you and this happened listen to this [noise] ...\nBags and a small Portland credit union last week he got a call himself from it from an eight hundred number\nThat matched the number that his credit union uses actually got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession he didn't answer the first two he's let him go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh well this was really be important I should answer [noise]\nSo he was greeted by a female voice to explain that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in ... in Ohio\nMade to his debit ATM card [noise]\nShe then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nHere we told the lady listen I'm going to replace him card immediately about travel out of state California\nWell the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in Oregon or California or those the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California ... not a problem\nAny charges that you make in Oregon or California will be fine\nOr to freeze the card everywhere else he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably do me a favor\n[noise] she said you know it just to make sure that everything's on the up and up or just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe says I guess that's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect shouldn't is this your mother's maiden name and he said uh yeah she said this is the correct spelling of your mother's maiden yeah yeah absolutely\nShe said can you please verify I Need to verify\nThe three digit code printed on the back of the card in your wallet\nIs this number these three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet and he said yeah uh yes so at this point everything seem ... pretty legit right\nThen she says so that I can apply\nSame PIN number to your credit card but I'm mailing out to you\nOh can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't have to go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have\nRight now and he said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card\nThat he hangs up and then he looks at his account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the date earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there was a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account so what the scammer had\nWas every single thing about him\nExcept for the pin\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the card they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had and duplicate of the card she had been number she had everything in\nFront of her but she didn't have the PIN number so by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't that\nWhere would they get all the information that is our dog when it's on the dark Web crazy stuff don't do any banking on the phone [laughter] ... the bank calls don't dancers yo green color green color hang up and go to the bank\nThat's it [noise] ah Chaz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin chess\n[noise] has thank you for taking my call how are you

data collection speaking of technology how much do you think your personal data is worth I mean everything that you do every website that you visited everywhere you go the TV shows that you watch the products that you buy it's all fair game for advertisers\nNow even when you take the kids temperatures listen to this this flu season Clorox paid kittens are\nIt's a tech startup that sells Internet

you to track fevers and symptoms okay get this\nThe data shows Clorox which ZIP codes around the country have increases in fevers\nClorox then directs more advertisement to those areas assuming that house oh they're going to be the market for products like what do you think this infecting wipes yes you follow me Kansas says they have sold more than five hundred thousands thermometers\nAnd the

iPhones was when there is going to be a worker out [noise]\nLet me tell you something you're in the world attack they already know how to do the work\nAround we just haven't heard about it yet [noise] and finally people really love their virtual assistance so much so news out this past week that over a million people has asked Amazon's Alexa to marry them that trained over the last year [noise]\nThat's not even including customers who might have proposed to their Google Assistant Apple's Siri or Microsoft court conduct [noise]\nIt seems that more than a handful of the estimated six

golfer apple is that it tells you like for example what what year was this Mac book released and then if the screen has to be replaced they do that it also still comes with a one year guaranteeing warranty\nAnd so you still have that but it's still gonna be you know you're still looking for you know twelve fourteen hundred bucks\nOh sheesh living it let me ask you questions I talked to a guy at

what's going on well wait wait wait willow use it and I talk to you again so you've been a caller before\nA long time ago I did a long time listener but I'm a ... called the number\nOh well thank you Jim I appreciate that appreciate that\nI listen to every weekend so I actually watch\nWell good way to either [laughter] so ah so how can I help you today\nWell I should've minding my own business but you didn't\nI didn't have an acquaintance too recently\nUh reconnected with a a daughter he had it in a marriage when he was in the military and Europe okay ah and that was a\nWell Nineteen Ninety eight she was born she reconnected and the people and his family are pretty concerned\nAh so I thought I did that old easy button and just do a background search on her and she would I could buy a no avail us failed miserably\nOh hey man saying wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years old okay All right so she's Twenty years old\nAnd that's right because you said Nineteen Ninety eight um you couldn't really\nFind anything about her like on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a Facebook account that looked like it had the origin or January twenty Eighteen oh but that's not very much of a social media no not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can tell your friend more about her or are you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scam ham or whatever\nAll of the above okay uh she does for for money or they're not rich by any means uh uh the the family just to spend a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nI'm sure and then all of a sudden you have kids coming out of the blue right and you're like okay I I'm\nJust a body standard all the [noise] well\nHere are good friend I mean you're worried about right and you want to make sure I was\nI was concerned and at least so uh I don't like she anybody get hurt\nA ... and and I heard you talk about these things before in a different sites for getting people up but I used to ... dot com yeah his book to go up and um come up with nothing\nYou know there's also family trained now\nWhere okay you\nMight be able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information there\nUh and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that is going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad so you really need to\nKeep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer glass of wine okay ... click and other places are and then of course there's the surge which is another place for you to check but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman is that\nYou know I'm surprised that that you know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media\nBecause that would be the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and so you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start snooping around and see if there's anything else out\nThere yeah I don't think he wants anybody ... thinks oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know [noise] why\nYou have a you have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nMight get is telling me that\nShe is his daughter and I don't\nThink she's got a very good background and I think she's just out to get what she can get\n... well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find online\nAnd you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for\nA you know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's going to be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on\nI and maybe you know he needs to text you every time that she ask for money so that this way you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember or it sounds like he's probably not even gonna tally and now that I think about that\nIncluding emergency power light water

that if you wanted to you know paper one there are the ones out there but I couldn't find the other ones that you might recommend well here's the good\nOh no I was gonna say you know so here's the deal is it you know he ... the the sun is going to know about the tracker okay\nAnd at twelve years old it's probably not a bad idea that the sun does know that there's a track or you know there's really no way to unless unless he could actually get the phone and install this tracker on and not have the kid no right\n[noise] I mean that's sort of issue okay alright that's sad when there's a a depending on the carriers of rising ... do you know who the carrier is a\n... to ... okay if the mobile has it to 'em because he's probably play paying for the kids' cell phone plan right\nI'm Sorry if he paid for the kids phone okay\nIs that the carriers they also they have something like family located or packages and the ... and it's like ten dollars a month but what I like if it's from the carrier is that not only can he see where the boys that but the boy can see where he's at\nAn okay and if the if he had you know his grandparents\nWhere he won even in normally you can have up to ten people on a plan\nOr a you know and you know there's also glimpse\nWhich is also something you might want to look at that but not through the carrier and that's G. L. Y. M. P. S. glimpse and Clinton glimpse works a lot like find my friends but it works across platforms okay and so I Would look at the team of a Web site looked at their family locate or\nLike I said normally it's like ten dollars a month for up to ten phones or whatever\nAnd then you know the boy can also you know the sun can actually have a sense of security that he knows if something does happen with his mom\nThen everybody's close by and he can see exactly in paying somebody and if not look at that glimpse program deck limp sap rather because I think that'll do the trick to and thanks for your

things have changed Google Maps now in Iowa and Android you can now have the nearest Philip spots show up on a map if you need an e v charge the listening show you buy the station what type of plugs charging speeds other business detailed\nUh and so if a business has a charging station available by the way that's going to be lifted too so again if you need and ... they charge you want to update Google Maps on Iowa west and Android [noise] alright\nRan across an interesting story over the wall Street Journal this past week and the title was you want twenty first ... for handing me a muffin the awkward\nAdvocate of I had ... and I don't\nKnow if you've noticed it but I certainly have that wherever you go where somebody choosing square and they're on their eye pad or on their phone is that they want to get tips for just about anything out there have you noticed that Andrew\nI'm so glad that you found this dinner bringing this up this is such a pet peeve for me it's on but I\nDon't want to name a possible I don't out impossible sponsor a future sponsor so I'll just say there's a place is called bone marrow bread\n[laughter] I'm Talking in code [laughter] and they have their yesterday [laughter] have amazingly\nDelicious food yes did the Greek salad ... it's the best out I've ever had booked every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that has just standing there at the register\nSo big cubs a bone marrow I developed the seven foot ... what's that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you but if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going to do\nThat though if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my Samsung Pay\nI'd a farmer's market I bought spinach pasta was twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the app that you tip\nOf course not okay so my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole\nAnd you know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is her business and what I Love about in the call is she treats her station like it is a business so she's professional sheets on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen\nAnd and for somebody her age to have this type of business at command has something she uses square\nAnd to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk for anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you got this all rock and she's like what are you me and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to tap and\nThere'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to [laughter] you know the third call which is really the goal of all businesses that people have more money Seinfeld explained to her I said so you know you're married and you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know\nAnd the you know and they're trying to get a they need a new you know they're getting ready for college and they're cheekbones looking really hungry [laughter] whatever it may be I said seriously\nResearch has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nAnd see if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and some people are going like thirty percent\nBut she isn't that different though because of that industry has a naturally of gratuity\nBut it's the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on the screen\nSo when you're up a narrow do you tip yeah really I Do that where they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay here's the reason\nWhy gay many many moons ago I worked at Houlahan which is a bar like Houston right and and when you wait tables and I also waited tables and when I was at ASU\nAt a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at bat\nSo if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register\nNo of course you want but and bad but at ... okay but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in\nAnd said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat if I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nHow are you lived there were a beach in California that's just south of half moon bay\nAnd is it is a beautiful there\nWell today the fog Israel and a little bit but it's really nice should be maybe the low seventies um but it's always got a little chill coming off the water\nNow let me tell you something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband how just because we have to\nThat's it and they uh they retired\nThey sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is how big the bus\nForty five foot and behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we all her car\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay so you guys\nBut just what everybody has the picture and um I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are or right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we're in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been RV\nWell great things I mean every day's an adventure in what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have ... you don't know we have a full size a refrigerator\nAirbus and if your guest decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up there\nSo we didn't get systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there are kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we are going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so uh the last we heard a was that we have to take out the side when does it take off\nAnd pick up outside and basically toss it out the window [laughter] um [laughter] short generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your\nMother board in the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change the mother board you'd be back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was it that was it off it\nWas it was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] nice [laughter] All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to listen up because how has a technical question and then I bet you you will have input on so how does that question\nYeah basically what happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early days ventures which I don't know if I Want everybody to see but we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA stick obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. G. P. site which is a file transfer sight\nOf that we can get out for our kids to be able to jump on there and drag that twenty two gig radio uh back on to their own computers so that was the best person that we know that knows about all things digital\nUh we decided to call the gym commandos show so here you go\nAnd so so what this is Andrew is that they use like a drop box or something like that right and the money to gig cats huge it's really a huge huge\nHuge and so unless you could you know you can break it out into individual videos right and then you too might be the best place that's what I was thinking too is that you just put it up there and then it can play and then if somebody wants to download it they can download if they want to\nYeah but then you can delete it\nYou want to you or you can protect it yeah you protecting put in on a you know with a um a private you are oh\nOh okay so that if somebody is searching for you know how big adventure which we all\nI mean All right\nThat they do that has big adventures doesn't quite come up well totally miss you guys\n[laughter] well we wish you do it's a very much for pleasure glad to talk to you today yeah\nNearly break up the files put it up on YouTube and when you guys come back out we're going to do years three of Hal in Jackie on the road because if you're an RV or\nThey have a lot of lessons that mother board story that they can pass along and they're really really great good godly people and I love them dearly thank you my good friends stay right where you are more coming up here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life\nParents teachers dentists and all these different technique up and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do it for a full two minutes of course Ninety percent of us don't emotional issues worn out toothbrushes to boot\nSo let me introduce you to quit clip is electric it's small light and sleek\nThere was a built in two minute timer that pollsters every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with quit\nNew brush heads are automatically delivered justice dentist recommend every three months for just five dollars\nTry quit and see whites backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals quit starts to twenty five dollars bats it\nDoes it get quip dot com slash came right now and get your first refill pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill package free at G.

material the excesses on steel and glass the eggs are they cut down the cash that money that you need to spend on because aluminum but it does come and fix scholars if you want that black white red yellow coral and blue\nAnd it actually has a smaller screen even though it has a bigger footprint or hand print I guess you'd say so it's worth the money well it starts at seven fifty ramps up to twelve hundred if you don't have the\nCash for the access I guess it as the screen is not as good\nI'm at the lower entry point to getting an iPhone so if that's what you can afford that's probably the best bet for you or buy a use iPhones ten which maybe even a better choice\nAnd before I go back to your phone calls and also our money tip about great gadgets that are worth the money it's a Halloween right just a couple of weeks away might be saying how do I kind of get my house all decked out for Halloween the smart way the tech way well\nA couple of systems you might want to check out what it's called the Sylvia smart plus range as some bald\nEli de floods spotlights flexible lighting stripped outdoor garden lights and the the here's the thing is that they come with their own apps that you can program all that\nAnd also worse with Amazon relaxed and the Google Assistant and also apples come get there's also the smart plus garden spot many don't worry about writing this down we have some more information over a commander dot com\nBut then you're going to need to think I'm all up and then you're going to need to add some spooky sounds and so that's where he labs it has Halloween living scenes and chew Halloween which is an avid issue haunted house those are some uh lighting and music ... so there are ways that you can still step up to a game\nAnd get that house ready for Halloween with all those lights and sounds and back to the phones we go with Charlie and a great bend Kansas Charlie\nKill great to talk to you\nWhat's thanks so much for your call today sure what's going on\nI Would go to a small theater group or we put on a ... year than I Am an old movie theatre here in ... in\nOh how cool is that it's also a ... to ... we deserve a good on that on the phone call and there's\nA we get our keys to the church to call them tractors to all these people and we know the good luck to placate so we got the keys floating\nAll [laughter] running all over the county everybody's got again [laughter]\nEverybody's got a dead key to this place when we were having a hard time controlling it so our idea is to one of the doors we would like to put like a digital type law sure that we can program was codes and give the hotel or is the truth\nLots of ... automatically explode or twenty four dollars or ... or ... or ... whatever is needed for that and the second to the to this\nLittle light or a little due to to a program like the on site but it was a cook rare but all such such nobody stopped at all the time\nRight well we don't live ... you know the good news is is that the technology exists the even better news Charlie is that it's super simple to use okay awesome and so when you buy the smartest lock is that a couple of ways you can do it uh I actually have\nOn a ... house that I Am is that I Am I have a ... legs smart block okay [noise]\nAnd so when somebody books through ... ... I can go and I can put their name in and I can say this law is going to work on this Saturday from eleven AM to next Wednesday at Fort Pierre okay\nAnd you put the person's name in there and then what's also interesting is that you have a full long ago when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time okay [noise]\nUm and you can program this remotely program this right on the Internet\nOr you can do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use the leg lock if not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock if you're looking for them all the best of luck with more bells and whistles there's something called the August pro Gen\nAnd the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet is that you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things have or you have what what I have is the next year up okay\nAnd then within the next year Hubbard is where things happen you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lives for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nAnd that there were water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charlie's what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby

shores\nWell it's running it's jumping is taking off over obstacles it's doing like basic park core and then the videos UC mighty atlas jogging around a grassy field he leaves over allowed within his path\nAnd he uses his whole body legs arms torso\nSteps are about one put four inches is computer vision on the approach they say to hit terrain accurately\nThey call this robot the world's most dynamic humanoid weighs about Seventy five kilos which is about a hundred and sixty five pounds\nBasically what this means that you're seeing the video and if your kids club member you're actually seeing this video\nIs that atlas can shift its weight and it's got eight twenty eight joints has hydraulics built and now the D O D said they're not really sure like one of these robots are not sure if they would never use them in combat but here are some things that I can do right now stand up after falling over\nRun balance on a narrow beam and get this atlas is really good at cleaning vacuuming and sweeping All right I Know what you're thinking\nThat robot has to be cheaper than keeping my wife and other robot taking over the world news here's something that you may be never thought of\nWould it be possible for a self driving car had not just be a self driving car but to use all of this technology be so bad that it can be a WMD a weapon of mass destruction [noise]\nWell research out this past week that autonomous vehicles are a giant security Redskin white hats need to get there before the black hats and do\nIn a closed door a Q A session Ilan most said that fleet wide attack was Tesla's nightmare scenario and announce it they were going to open source their security modules so that all the auto makers could work together for a safer self driving future\nAll right I just hope it when they open source at all they do a better job at that than actually building the cars so governments are trying to get involved to putting controls around these self driving cars or I the D O D can't even change the default password on a computer controlling warheads and as far as Tesla's go\nI'd be shocked if they were in business just a few years from now\n[noise] boy I don't tell you there's a lot of self driving car news this past week and you may have heard of way mo that is Google's self driving taxis right\nAnd it's rolling out across the United states but how they plan to use it is very interesting and I bet nobody has told you this yet about way mo because let's do the math together\nHow does Google make its money anybody yes you in the Ford truck they make a huge chunk of change off of advertising right or companies buying advertising people seeing advertising so put us all together with the self driving taxi\nDo you see the future yet do you envision how it's going to we're All right let's say you go to Google and you search for I don't know fresh Christmas tree up pops in ad for a place five miles away too far to walk too far to carry a tree or on your back but wait\nWhat do you see that Google Search you see an ad click here to had way mo give you a free ride to get your Christmas tree\nSo hypothetically we could start seeing promoted rides for free in place so different search ads on Google\nNow way most of this past week it's self driving cars had ten million miles of experience on public roads and just glad there isn't a self driving car run by Microsoft because every day we hear about some crash crazy stuff\n[noise] and finally as of July twenty ninth team in certain parts of the world all electric cars will need to make a low speed noise by law\nYou see these electric cars are just too quiet right now people can't hear the cars and they're just too many accidents and from twenty twenty on they have to be retrofitted with sound generators you\nSee with no engine sounded all road safety groups they're calling them silent killers and they said they put the lives of kid elderly blind the death\nHeadphone where's textures are in jeopardy so we got a hold here I became committed from a brand new sound is going to be heard when a lead trick car goes by now I Want you to hear it it's going to be the sound and of a ticket or car it has a fancy name\nIt's called the audible vehicle alert system now the sound can be heard and speeds up to twelve miles per hour\nThis before I play the north and tell you a little bit more about\nThe noise is four years in the making\nAnd it was designed specifically to be audible by ... organs but not heard by anybody inside the car\nAnd this is funny that first the technicians developed as down that was like they say a size five space craft but they had to shelve it because people when the car was driving by they would look up in the sky rather than at the road so back to the labs they when they came up with a brand new sound\nAnd if the minute former speaker located behind the front and grilled since we heard in every direction so let's take a listen to the sound that the brand new electric jaguars going to make in your neighborhood\nOh that's it you know\n\nSo as the electric cars going by that's the sound that that the that the researchers say that doesn't sound like a size five space craft or what do you think Andrew you're ready for that\nWhy don't they just make it sound like a car like a V. eight [laughter] [laughter] they're gonna use that one yeah yeah you know what you just can't beat the sound of the eighth or bigger race but I mean here we are we're it's\nStill sounds like a spacecraft to make it look enough where's that where's each week I was like a shaver [laughter] I'm not sure that that's the sound that the jaguar was really going forward that particular point [noise]\nHey listen let's talk about one of our grade

whole idea behind using the VP an app\nIs that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and Germany oh how fun Oh yes I Can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're

you hold up your phone and augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool\nIt's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you into like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to the ... most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right quick song and you know if you could do a food toward any of these that it's been great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's Nord VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure and it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month\nAnd so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a comment that show picks buttons you can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go to your credit cards that you're going I

showing\nA single parent community with triple digit membership at ... community good are over forty thousand\nWell the reason why I the reason why I say that is Google said that they shut it down not only because they had were going to talk about this and the next hour but they had it open for three years but basically the heads of goals that nobody is using it anyway so it was shut it down so you do have different options there's one side or that you\nDidn't mention is that it's called the ds for off and that's D. I. A. S. P. or a with dance for it looks and it works it acts a lot like Google Plus where a it's a little bit different meaning\nThat you choose a pod as the kind of that's what they call their ... their groups pod so you can create a pod if that's what you want you sign up and then you join the conversation uh and then they're also integrated into your other social media so if you did want to tell everybody on Facebook or on Twitter ... what have you that you had this group going that would be one way\nThere's also another site called steam it and that's S.

or Andrew and I discuss various topics of high intellect in value\nAnd I preface that by saying Andrew wants to talk about well Andrew wants to talk about I did I say Hi intellect and value did OK I'm wants to talk about Kanye West\nYes but it's more of the tax side of the Kanye West okay we're we're not getting into politics\nNot at all at all love 'em hate him whatever who cares but the Internet was reacting to Conyers phone\nFirst of all we learn Kanye West uses a cell phone because he took out that phone and it's an iPhone and the unlocked it to show the price of the United states uh gifts okay when he unlocked that he was on camera\nSo everybody got his pass code correct okay can you guess what is ... let me give you a hint very\nSimilar to yours well you know I have I saw that them alert to you okay I saw that headline that they pass code was\nZero zero zero zero zero zero correct six zero which you know that used to be\n[laughter] until ... when did you change it this morning I saw the blind [laughter] and\nSo now it's it's a lot more difficult for you to break into one one one one one close seven seven seven seven seven seven that's far from the zero zero right much harder the other thing that the Internet was criticizing calling us for tech wise\nWas that he had his phone in a case yeah I was the big deal about that it's not cool it's no longer cool to have your smartphone in a case\nSo who's saying that it's not a cooler these people that are ... are they like trust fund kid that are being 'cause those of us that have to shell out ... you know a hundred thousand Fifteen hundred bucks on a phone I don't want it to shatter if I drop and the criticism is is that you can get tempered glass on the front and you no longer need\nThe case on the back unless you have a mold for you that's gonna charge you had there is no reason to have a case well that's what the Internet\nWas attacking other stupid okay here's the other reason why you need a case corners right well that's just that but you notice the color right a very pretty good minds pink my black okay but the reason why it's paying it so that when I throw it into my black per se\nI can find so that's why if you got when like me I have a rose gold iPhone it'd be easy to find in my purse\nFew I guy with a rose gold following the only I for some and blows bad case on anyway what does it\nMatter so we were talking about communist password yes zero zero zero zero zero zero there was a call for everyone to try and hack his social media accounts so they wanted to use\nEmail addresses and log in and then just try the password password one two three because odds are that's what his passport is so then came out the stories about horrible past for us to have and I learned something which surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter]\nI've never heard about password walking\nYou never heard a password walking never that's where you like you walk on the keys in order for you to enter and your password\nMost popular walked password is one shoe to W. E. three four are good at the top row and the bottom row and you walk with your fingers across ...\nAnd then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to cage two rows they'll go down three\nRight back to the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. which is the first two rows\nAnd let me tell you something if you weren't just look at that as a password he'd be like that's a darn good pass what exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol for most you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords I'm Still do it I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\n... what was your or second grade teacher his middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's why I Hope to choose to have verification is so great\nEspecially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... and only use it for fantasy football so every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password 'cause it's been six months and they used it\nBut if I have an Yahoo apple on my phone they send me a message through the app and I can get in yeah and that's really the off yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we always get people who complain and go oh you know they're just discriminating against me because I don't have a smartphone [laughter] no they're not trying to set up security\nI'm going to tell you something now my space and linked in yes they bowls since two thousand and sixteen if I've huge security breach\nOr you know in their website ... can you guys in the category of brands one or two of the most popular passwords that were used in the morning and\nThis is really a tough one I don't know these two stories were connected I think they might be and I buy the blonde hair [laughter]\nMy space and linked in yeah just use it as their password but what's that Mustang that's probably the these are brands of so Mustang Ferrari people like to use car names as their passwords playboy\nOr then our next command on demand that we put out this week is about the deceptive technologies that are being used to fool your senses and why businesses and celebrities like Sharon ... pep boys or abandon Facebook\nAnd what you need to know about Facebook's controversial new posting guidelines for businesses and also for fake news and then of course we had the golden age of radio some of the most popular programs from the thirties forties and fifties we have a some history attack some great podcast tech news today tech news this week you can\nGet all of our podcast on Apple's pod cast on Google clay or get your podcasts or head over to our website over at pot net dot com once again that's ... net dot com and back to the phones we go with Tom in Peoria, Illinois hello there\nThomas hello Hi welcome what's going on\nWell the question I have had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that ... something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I end up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go there look they're an easier way to do that\nBy having an example okay that we'd babysit our grandchildren\nFor the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer the shit here's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday surfing act\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in check it ended up being thirty five pages long about fifty to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could help me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site a there are sites like ours that will do round up so say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available I see\nIf you're looking for a particular app you can always read the the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yeah so we used to fly you shutter flies at\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that a huge these but you know making photo books as a singer weather on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book do yes and we got it and cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word bank called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app that only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it is John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that done\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kinda fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they we communicated back and forth on five or ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so in the next time you have a task foot in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us okay\nOkay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or drop me a note\nThrough the website and I know this sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the website\nAnd I've got a system I've done it for many years and when you send me your question things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content at for a tip or a cool site or an app review or whatever it may be\nOver a commander dot com or you could just call it give us a call to the show and fewer kids club member by the way you always get priority calling and you can join comes club right now\nOver and get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about what the Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the Kim commando show [noise]\nWith more and more of our lives are moving on line intrusion into our privacy can have devastating consequences one great way to secure your privacy so you can have the freedom to be another on traceable online is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network\nWhen choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it\nAnd I recommend F secure freedom VPN F secure as a publicly lifted company they have the thirty years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy\nIt's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up you'll be up and running in just a few minutes\nF secure even let you try for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required\nYou can trust as the cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online or to your freedom VPN now and get twenty percent off when you use discount go camp visit F dash secure dot com slash camp that's F dash secure dot com slash camp\nThey October more than once a day on the ... radio a radio\nA perfect for decorating the house or just setting the dairy mood [laughter]\nOur inspired me play let your tracks with labor in my lifetime we've got about everyone's talking about like maybe it'd be more modest balk at him and Joe Rogan experience all your music all your favorite\nBut my id KPSK dot com [noise]\nI are the forces and brought to buy be prepared dot com slash cam you're one step solution for emergency food water gear and resources visit and\nBe prepared dot com slash Kim and be ready for anything once again that's be prepared dot com slash cab [noise] All right there about nine million Web cams and security cams that are just wide open to attack\nAnd I want you to make sure that yours is not on the list a there's a company called ... among guy\nThat's all that the company who makes all these Web devices and security cameras but guess what\nThat's not going to me the name on the Web cam or their security can because they make tons of Web cam for all kinds of companies but basically what's happening is that these Web cams and security cams are so accessible that if you change in the fall password\nSomebody can still break him and if you want to see if your Web cam security cameras on the list it over to commanded outcome of course that's K.

three part question about yeah my question it's a ... to ... all along reputation management mhm I guess not let's let's be like what would be the best oh yeah that I can find full small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it those old or a I'm a software that you ... and then the F yelled at such an optimization ethical would all all\nLittle bit so so what's going on with your business on line\nWell the problem now than what some of it but it's obviously what most of us have is you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bed ridden balance it out but obviously it doesn't work that way you know the people have the experience is usually doesn't go online and put both the\nPositive experiences with you at your business [noise] so what I'm up here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses so what I Need to do it by something for someone to neutralize the negative responses that's happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any\nReputation type management farm okay is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody to do the job when you've already done the job right\n[noise] right and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp\nOr where where is it but I'm Glad for all the\nMedical it's like ... grade a car okay all the eggs that'll\nGet so OK you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nPhil anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay but because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before because they you know can you up on line and\nJust drop some wrapping up there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now out weighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it and what I have\nHeard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program\nCalled recognize Dr status and that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam\nI get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo so in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn\nWhat it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google
