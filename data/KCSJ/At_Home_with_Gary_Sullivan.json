be able to okay and he's All right so can the ... if I make a bad lane change and cut someone off\nCould my car tell me a\nJust a channel just a heads up I mean it's all good don't panic or anything but you really did cut that person off you shouldn't have done what you did or or vice versa you know\nI think with the desires of there with the the change in the FCC law here a couple of years ago where the vehicle to vehicle communication ... was enabled\nAnd that is being designed probably as we speak that\nThe vehicle that you're about to run into could be controlled also by your decision which yeah scary ... where it could say I say scary but\nI'm going to move over oh there's a car they're the only way to avoid the Saxons to slow the other car\nDown so at that point then you've got this slight track of cars that are all being controlled right independently but yet but yet as a group hive mind yes exactly exactly [laughter] well done the so\nCould you have a virtual assistant in the car that would be talking to you I think it's totally logical to say that was a close one Chris [laughter] next time consider looking over your left shoulder Shannon you stopped a little bit close to that car in front of you [laughter] and I spent the summer age aircraft and also not only that\nBut the ... uh and I noticed that the driver of the other car did notice they looked at the mirror you could they some of those systems read where your eyes are ... and it would be\nYou've seem to have learned the drivers around you and your entity\nIs above the cause a problem for people around you whose blood pressure have all gone out of it [laughter] you've raised them beyond the average woman is that is totally possible it is totally pause oh that is you have a shared the person getting out of the car is holding a strange device\nBut the next step of that is\nShannon there's a McDonald's on your right hand side I notice that your blood pressure is a little low you probably need something to eat you might want to stop at McDonald's sponsored by you know all that stuff All right I brought some new what are you got\nA new start up I think this is all of these ideas that we're talking about good or bad uh this one I think is the worst idea ever\nYour automotive but you're about to talk about well it it exists so a new start up as a developed a way to get lazy people to work up a sweat by driving I'm intrigued the fit\n... it's a pedal powered vehicle that's what the ... is based on an Audi a four of onto powered by the regular two point oh leader four cylinder gas engine but control of its acceleration and breaking\nIs due to bicycle pedals\nThe peace even getting a horrible idea rubble idea the ... remove the accelerator pedal and in its place as a pair of bicycle pedals hooked up to uh fly will the accelerators control and that actually exists they've gotten done that they've done it the accelerator is controlled by an active peddling motion rather than depressing the peddling a conventional vehicle\nThey must have modified the foot ...\nWell too right they had to deal with this set up generates an electronic pulse to engage accelerator they've also remove the break and replace it with a hand brake located on the steering column\nConcept allows you know you can imagine what there's three modes drive fast for highway speed so it's like a ten speed Dr slow for slow moving traffic and no drive for bumper to bumper traffic drivers can also opt in for a harder work out via rotary dial that controls the pedal resistance that's the worst idea of member\nWhy did you not see that car that you just hit I was busy pedal and I was getting tired\n[noise] it's just a\nStanding out that my car will be on the side of the road with his hands on his knees was that a legitimate story and absolutely one yeah yeah it was and they're doing it in remember where they they have a car on the road of course but yeah it wasn't in America\nBut can you think of a worse idea than that\nNo [laughter] really it's right up there eight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call that came into the who the hotline\nMy name is ... the two thousand seven he's on his uh eighty seven thousand miles on it for ... for so long the ... the sounds like squeaking perhaps on ... took it to get it checked\nBecause it really need the serpentine go changed it only has a set of thousand miles on it we should be holding off on that in order to secure some minor it's not hard to hear what it's like\nNot only a great question mommy to take this one here feeling happy I change\nThat eighty seven thousand miles is I Would say hundred ... this this is this I'm winging is making a hundred thousand it's probably about the uh interval on that and since it's squeaking it's telling you maybe there is I Would go ahead and changing nothing bad will happen\nI'm worried about the eleven years yeah there you go it's the time in the elements of eleven years is a it's a long time most recommendations are going to be half of that to replace the main accessory built on a lot of these vehicles\nNow having said that I've had numerous ones that I've taken past the five to say I wouldn't do that but but if you're starting to if it's starting to talk to you and they believe it's coming from the belt\nYou want to look at the belt and there are some of the ... and things like that that they make\nIf you look into it in the parks catalog and they have a\nCommon soul part it's a ... for that vehicle that can sometimes be an indication that get the kitten replace all the parts replace the rollers and everything like that but if it's just a tiny church I Would start with the low hanging fruit will develop on it while the belt is off have him just inspect all the idol or poll using different things to make sure nothing is\nExceptionally loose and you should be just fine so I'm more concerned about the fact that it's got eleven years on it almost twelve than I Am about eighty seven thousand miles\nIf he called and said the exact\nSame thing it was this vehicle and it works fine ran fine he wants to buy it and it is never had the serpentine they'll change you would say\nAbout changes that I I definitely don't change the belt and so that people forget\nQuite a bit is that it's not always the miles at the time and in the time that something's been in service has to do with the element if if that had been in a climate controlled storage and never been out in the elements you get\nAdvantage of making that stuff last longer but the the robbers and the and the tires or the belts the hoses all these different things they do do great overtime just from the from the elements of the of the of the earth's I'm\nWorking on it speaking of the same thing we had a call I was listening to a recent pod cast and we had a call from a guy who had an oath to tourists and we were talking about higher where and whether the tires needed to re replaced and ate codes on tires and I got to thinking about an hour to tourists and he said well you didn't drive in it was in great condition\nIs that a classic is that something you ensure as a classic not quite right or friends at Berkeley classics um\nHoliday would take that and that's a process that\nSeriousness if you had a car like that and you thought it was getting to be a classic\nUh and you're keeping it for that reason I Would definitely reach out to Berkeley classics dot com and ask them and they they would tell you\nWell in our professional experience so based on your driving style is what you're doing the car we we could potentially do this or we could not do the Ninety crown Victoria that we had earlier today and and now the fact that he uses that as a daily driver would probably disqualify\nUm can you drive your vehicle you around with a classic car insurance like our friends at Berkeley classics most definitely but there are parameters that we need to talk about so I think that the two tourists would be it's working its way into that window for sure and then you just go back by degree and it becomes\nA way of starting to see now people are put up

and in great flexibility also\n[noise] okay [noise] did you ever felt like I should\nBut I think his phone was dying as we were speaking All right so ... that particular product that I just mentioned by the way has the best at ... the best flexibility to pretty much any correct filler\nUm you probably don't want to use that in cracks that are less than what Charles ... which was\nThree a seven inch because it is very very thick if you have hairline cracks a quick remakes of products and acrylic self leveling sealer called correct seal those are for hairline cracks quarter inch caught cracks that type of thing but\nWhen you get up three a half inch self leveling your thing perfect if you can get them wider than that you know an inch which you can use it as you can use a backer rotten that

lighting and wow what a change there's been an asshole lighting over the last Twenty years and if you're like me you're probably a little bit confused\nOn what type of light and you use in our home even if it's L. E. D. there's different qualities and different types and different lighting so we're going to get that all straightened out we have carbon best story he's which GE Lighting and Carmen welcome that almost scary solving\nGood morning Gary how are you doing fantastic how about\nYou I'm doing great it's a great weekend so let's talk lighting because man we've been through quite a change over the last Twenty years\nOr that is we have we had incandescent lighting and used to be you go into a store and you know you knew what you're going to buy and then we went to a whole CFL thing and a lot of people are just just hated that lightning and now we're in the L. E. D. lightning so\nCan you can you kinda just talk about an overview of lightning in general ... kind of dig deeper [noise]\nWell it's a great time to be talking about writing October is energy action month for converting incandescent are halogen to Eli day is the right time to be thinking about it especially as they are getting\nShorter and I took any longer ... really has changed with almost come full circle Gary in terms of\nLike bald performance only had CFL we can have an energy savings and long life but kind of sacrifice that like quality or that flow warm up for that flickering whatever it is basically allowed us to do is to get basically the same performance that we had with incandescent\n... in terms of bright light dental comes on instantly what great color without having the sacrifices other things that we had with CFL and get the long life and the energy saving\nMan I'll tell you Eli de lighting is super energy efficient as\nIt is if you look at a sixty watt incandescent bulb now more than Ninety percent of the energy that was coming out of that Bob was heat\nMhm Mm yeah lady\nExcusing eighty five percent less energy it to the same brightness so you're getting an eight hundred looming equivalent sixty ... light bulb\nMhm using less than ten ... instead of our traditional sixty ... so it's a much better from an efficiency standpoint huh option than traditional incandescent off\nNow when I go to the store to buy LCD bulbs and I'm sure everybody's got one or two ... made the entire switch I get in there and I see flood lights I see\nYou know what is um you know like a sixty ... old fashioned ball and I see different price ranges there's different qualities of Eli ... correct\n[noise] there is like with anything in a home improvement store or had a mass merchandising store or there is differences in terms of performance there's differences in terms of quality because you're looking at LA de\nLa ... brightness they don't want to necessarily at the water's edge\n... has really what we're trying to replace when we're looking at a sixty what all is looming right does sixty what bothers going to produce about a hundred moments in the first four as I thought that has around\n... author lumens the second the you might want to look for his life so there's different tiers of LA days okay some last\nTen thousand hours on the last Fifteen thousand hours which would be three hours per day is scary to quibble aren't of having that bought last for Thirteen Years so you can do something different on your Sunday mornings instead of\nJust like all like the last one I ... it was like thirty thousand hours\nYeah isn't that amazing Adams fantastic camera that's perfect for me [laughter]\nAnd and now the third thing the thing that LA to his kind of opened up for us as on one hand we can replicate incandescent so they're looking for the soft warm light of incandescent bulbs\nAnd they can provide that but not everybody wants incandescent like light or maybe a different room is your house you want to create a different food or different\nEffect ... and that's the LAT has opened up so now Gary one of the more popular trends right now is vintage lighting loan yeah ...\nWhere you see the like old ...\nExactly right from an efficiency standpoint those bombs are terrible and they're using more\nElectricity but not providing a whole lot of like ... now has given you the opportunity to get that same look that came warm candlelight glow mhm\nBut using a fraction of the electricity so you're using five watts instead of terms he was perfect perfect and you're getting along life for this is an opportunity for even on some of those styles that you don't necessarily want to replicate what you had with incandescent\n... also switched LAT and get those benefits\nWell just taking everybody back from when they went to shop for their first L.

alright eight hundred eight two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can join us we're talking about your home and John welcome\nIdle and Gary Yes sir fine hey got an a\nOr some kind of bounce off you got a mobile home here and I tore out the bath tub and I'm putting a shower stall and its place hum\nAnd all the plumbing ... is in right now and when I see 'em a shower up to the rock climbing I'm using a suit chief I'm a brass a drain ... million with those\nTell me what's his name is again this is so cheap laugh I'm a drain that goes into the bottom of the shower stall\nCame with a Ninety degree brass type you know this is this is a straight and the ABC comes up on all okay into it and he put a new frame washer and they're right any type it down okay so it's like a compression fitting exactly and it's about an\nInch long and and here's here's my dilemma um when I tour out the bath tub there was a great big hole underneath that were the original Plame was put in for the tub and that's where all the mice were coming in\nAnd so I boxed all that and so now you basically you have to have a boxer with the rough farming\nOr going out to the septic system and then the shower sits on top of a on top of that\nAnd when I put the shower base in I can I'll never be able to get to the pie trap again it will be buried in that box um and I can't afford to have a leak in there and and so the PVC has been tested no leaks there that's all well lit up really nice my concern that Neal\nFrame washer and and so the question I have four years this\nOne I put that Neil ... gas cars I should call it out of ... if I put some silicone feel on that gasket as well and then fly it down into the drain\nAnd it goes around the PVC and then I tightened than not on top of it um ... when that silicone drive I should never have a leak there is what I'm thinking\nBecause if I get a week on ever going to know I have a leak because I Can't get it on the shower vase once I put it in ha ha ha I wanted your thoughts on on does that make sense that um\nTell me about the ... like the clear nylon plastic or is it rubber arise\nIf it's rubber I black piece of rubber it's round about an inch about an inch tall [noise] um and it it when you put it into the\nThe drain itself you got that compression not and it's supposed to see on basically compressed them um but the PVC can move a little bit and I live in moves a little bit I'm I'm afraid that seal is going to break 'em and then I'm going to get a leak and this is going to go over the water she's going to go down that box I built in of actually ... out\nIs that the end of the world I mean can you is that assessments that happened\nI got to tear the uh I had the quality of a momentary the blanket on okay\n'cause it's kind of the shower it's kind of in a metal okay and I'm I'm a ...\nIt was like the whole sharp pan or anything like that\nIf I could take up the whole shower pan but once I put the top half of the shower and so it's a full size ... at the bottom happen you've got top out when I when I put that path on\nAnd I feel like on those two together like the manufacturers said as opposed to I'm never going to get it out [noise]\nSo you got to come from underneath\nI thought I'm going to have to come from underneath the mobile home if I ever have a week but the challenges that probably never going to know if I have a\nWeek right right right yeah right and then it might come back so one of the problems I have with\nThe silicone and maybe I don't know your answer to this is I don't know if the silicone will compromise ...\nOkay I'm In I don't know I wouldn't have to look into that if I put ... ... is there a way to double up to ... you\nKnow it's if it's all designed to to work together as one drain unit you know so it's about an eighth of an issue that you know we're pretty sure that that's about an inch cause slide down it grips quite a bit\nI I'm also trying to think of all the times they've done plumbing whether those ... are ever failed it's usually the pipe that failed okay I'm In quite honestly a lot of times taken those washers off a re used them\nUm\nSo I guess if I were you um first of all I I really think of it sounds and you had a leak and you didn't know it and the it rots out and everything you know we don't want to do it but it's probably not the end of the world it is

how long ago was that\nProbably Twenty years later that's pretty good and money tied yeah that's pretty good [laughter] so that's really sad that that's really\nYour option so aluminum siding whether

crack it's not going to absorb moisture so it's very stable\n... preparation\nAgain the key runners she'll do that the rhino shield is just heavier duty than a pain it's yeah so I guess it's a coating it has\nMore reflective properties\nIt's going to listen I mean that paint last really good so that you know I mean that's certainly an option for you\nOr the rhino she'll be probably one and done I'm going to say it say lifetime warranty I could be wrong on that I come at forgive Warren he is but I Know it's a long time it's at least twenty five years\nUm but\nDie it's perfect for ... is perfect

not happening\nIn the insulation mhm I have ten dollar hit that lady I'm Wondering if you think that they were\nTrying to remodel trailer with that and now it or what we should\nBut I think the first thing you need to do is you need to confirm whether there's black mold and there are a dangerous molded doesn't have to be black a dangerous mold or\nNot I'm ... and you can do that to buy um\nInexpensively amber it's um it's a\nFive minute mold test kit you can get a mid ace hardware\nIt's almost like a pregnancy test kid it's a little plastic device in a swab and you don't have to swab the mold you can just swab around the tops of doors you some of the you know there's usually dust on door frames um swab that and inserts that into\nUm into this test kid is it'll tell you if it's dangerous mold or it's not dangerous moment if it's dangerous mold\nThen you really got to consider whether it's even worse remodeling that\nUm because\nThat could be not only just in the insulation that could be on the\nUm backs of the uh panels of the walls\nIn other words that trailer may not be able to hold is valued to take care of that\nA particular you know the issue so the first thing I Would do amber is is test for mold and then kind of make the decision from there as far as the league you know whenever you have water introduced to a house\nAnd you have organic material there is a good chance you mold and may not be black mold or the dangerous times more but you would have mould\nAh you would have maybe a common variety of mold that wouldn't be so dangerous but I I'm thinking you got some big issues with the roof leaking and you've been sick and you've got um\nUm you know you're able to observe that there's some mold and the insulation of patching the roof I don't know how old the trailer is I don't know what the problem is somebody they have to take a look at it and see what it would take to get that straightened out but I I'm going to venture to guess that the answer is\nI'm no it's it's probably not going to be money well spent in that trailer or to um to get rid of the mold and to reconstruct it All right thank you much for the call

speed unless the hill is too big and the middle east gonna make a lot of noise and he had to sit there [laughter] yeah it's not going to they're no they're not a powerhouse by any means you're dealing with a a really low horse power\nEngine that things have changed so much\nNow I mean we're talking about even some of the really weak vehicles or you know for a hundred horse power in in some of these bigger things now where we were lucky to get a hundred and fifty to yes hundred and Seventy five out of some of these old big engines you know they just did that\nI've driven a lot of older Chevy Truck and they just had a lot more you know or or get up and go to this thing does\nWell and part of that could be because it's old a ... it's just you know I I Know I got to have a valid on\nWell wow yeah and then it'll be old and warn of [laughter] I've seen have you on a fire truck that Scott thirty thousand miles on it [laughter] yeah they're they're shot a\nYou know a lot of that has to do with idle time a lot of it has to do with just the components that they made these things out of and their ability to the not wear out in the fluids that were available the time\nA new like you see all all the time no cars now we say oh two hundred thousand miles it's runs great so good good car well the same car made with thirty or forty thousand miles that was Thirty years old the\nThe things you're going to want to do those still just like any other gasoline combustion engine is\nIf it's if you if you just acquired it you know make sure do a cylinder test to see what kind of healthy you have just a simple compression early down test in each cylinder easy to get at the spark plugs for the most part and you could check just to make sure you got healthy cylinders\nAnd at that point to make sure the timing is that correct or make sure that the U.S distributor and is in good shape\nYou know just some of the the carburetor or you can't always do much with those if they're operating correctly find out if it's open to all the the uh [noise] you know all the correct or butterflies and everything it it just makes it chokes not stuck\nOr just stuff like that that can make them extra doggy but they they weren't awesome to begin\nWith knowing a lot of those the timing is off but they they had so little contribution per cylinder to make up all eight that um\nSometimes if you disable one cylinder you really didn't hear a huge difference in the engine but if you've got that one ... ... it's gonna be noticeable while you're trying to drive it but it may still run pretty good at all\nIs it a straight sick yes so does it seem like it ... if you're in your polling gears of the better ratio does it is it the same way if you like in first gear second gear\nIt it's got a little more slapped them and then you get up to the higher a speed but\nThat's you know what I got to talk about the scout again because I just can't stop myself wanting to scout in a in a local small town drawing for the American legion as a fundraiser and it was somebody had donated it was just to use\nA little bit rusty scout and I'm like oh this is kinda cool what year was it I Want to see it was the Seventy\nFour or five I'm going to go look it up we've an orange knows white it was a hard top was it was a believing that had a thrill for a V. eight in it or something like that and\nThey yeah and it was definitely an eight and for whatever reason into will drive that thing could spin the tires my ... one of my best friends and my cousin tied he snapped the drive shafted it finally we we've got a little too aggressive with it but that made a\nA number of runs up the split rock river when it was frozen in the wintertime up into the trees I could talk about it now but [laughter] it was a I was the wrong person to pick up on my life [laughter]\nIt was free right so I bought a raffle ticket right okay but what it was you know their bottom of the split road I Know we we we sold it to somebody who was\nStill serviceable\nThanks for calling we appreciate it Don Don thanks very much\nFor the call good luck let's talk to Nathan Nathan you're on the end of the show what can we do for ya\nI I I got a two thousand five Subaru Legacy wagon and we've got problems with their rear suspension or the back of the car say almost looks like it's been lowered and we can't seem to figure it out on what needs to be replaced or what's going on I'm\nOn a whole batch shock springs all that had been replaced in a funny thing I think it's gotten a little worse some kind of look on friday of I mean I've even found on line where a couple of different places are shows actually selling thinking about strangers for sure we're so I don't know if this was a common problem if that's the solution or not\nWe're all those springs and strokes replaced with brand new parts and it\nWas I actually replace the old just order the whole um shock and spring altogether I didn't want to mess with a ... percent of the springs now\nAnd when you ... you know was it good as soon as you did that for a short period or is it still exactly the same\nI remember it being a little better but it never really fix the issue\nThat the same problem with Graham freeze in Ninety seven but we'll leave for a full ready throw it on there with everything on it correct yeah exactly yeah and it right on some of them were just lower like what the grand prix in that car they just they set\nA little lower when they were brand new they were good for ten thousand miles than they settled and that's the way they said they were lower and if you don't like the way they said they do have some time space available when you put those spaces in sometimes you do you why Mitt sometimes you don't depending on\nWhat is it modified in that suspension on a car but they they do right off the wall ones I can picture in my head right now that our customers have most of them right pretty low\nI pulled it up on Google Images all the images looked like the back in ... like they all look like they're saying look at a little bit\nI guess I'm trying to understand if he's described as something where he is or if he had some of those ah you know those things people hang on the Republican they'd be dragging on the ground or if you know how low it is in your nicknamed the cars for a while there but the\nJohn ... there's a hitch on there and it drags out it drags you know\nEasy and that's it that's not all the all the way many yes [laughter]\nYeah there isn't a bunch of weight and back or anything but it just looks like it's lower than it should like something's wrong with that were suspension\nWell just trying to think of the way the cars you know the ballast in the car if there's anything that could be on the front they become just trying to think through the geometry of the car if there's anything we're missing here\nOr anti sway bars are are going to stop typically left and right when you're keeping the car flat when you're going to a corner that really shouldn't have anything to do with it um you know as far as the suspension at the back\nThough some of the cars not this one day and have it like a true a transfer Springer cross with sometimes crack it when people would like in the grand prix the earlier ones that was a common problem but\nNot in this kind of a car it's it's kind of an independent suspension with that strike\nThere's only so many single that there is there's only so many things back there I Would say that if you're any\nIs there any downside to putting those Pacers enemies or anything that's going to\nKnow as long as the other it could harm something you want to give you the line you know you want a good qualities but he says it's not okay for ink on you and then you want to do the line 'cause when you changed the height of a car the\nRight you're going to change the alignment not so it's gotta be gotta be aligned after that's by the justice than even the ... like Chevy Truck so a lot of people with the least cricket so then the dodge do they want to have leveling kits available for them to bring you end up you want to make sure those things wind good\nYeah we did that on my sons pick up we put the level or get on the front spring blocks to the back just to bring the right how are you up a little bit and we brought it down and the rangers had it still wind after that just to get back into true and that was recommended operating procedure\nNathan thanks very much for the call good luck that'll do it for another hour and the under the who'd show until

off gassing there was one of the\nUh problem some would flooring hit a number of years ago that made the news but usually formaldehyde in wood or furniture or anything along those lines\nBreaks down over the years in other words it eventually dissipates um I the interesting part you said is there was kind of a build up on that surface which is\nKind of challenging what that could be um in in that ... on that surface Andrew you feel that\nOr whatever that is is where the smells coming from\n... to ... which are not true I mean it's\nYou ... have you done anything at all with it at this point I mean having\nTried by a ... foot and a quarter inch long down over new carpet and it's still there yeah a lot better off the chair that are looking at online research a little bit of this scale and uh\nWell I think a few in an odor a eliminating product um for sure uh but um I Am a little little concern to what that would be\nUm you know we're trying to solve something we don't know what it is but there's there's um I don't know if you've ever heard me talk about a product line called odor exit\nOdor exit makes a variety of products um from sprays into actual chlorine dioxide which actually eliminates\nThe the odor in the air so\nThat may be a product you want to take a look at or you may want to give this company called to see which one they would present you didn't have any pets it's nothing along those lines correct\nNo place for that aspect I you know they they didn't really hang out in that room ... with a closed off\nAll right All right ... you know the one interesting thing though is when you put that Lou won over we really can't get to the particle board now I'm\n... I'm On a campaign room I owe it kept pulling back well\nHere's the website you can also get their phone number there maybe talk to them and I'll talk about the two products I think that it worked for you it's odor exit oh deal are X. I. T. dot com\nThey make a A R G\nRight there and you can read and they also have a little short to figure out which one is this doesn't match the odor this kills the odor okay they have one called ... concentrate\nWhich is I think more for natural\nSmells you know animal issues and things like that I'm In that's why I asked that question is really going to be on\nThe area that is kind of infected with his older so we got carpet and then we got Lou on and then we got the problem areas so this probably would not be the product\nThen they also have one called odor exit magic which is just an air\nA it's a spray it doesn't have to be on the problem area just in for the uh the environment in that room to eliminate that order 'em then there's one which is I really think the product you want [noise] called a cue em\nAnd its air quality manager and this is an excellent product for eliminating [noise]\nEven mold spores in the ... and I know you don't have mould but mold spores in the air a in a in an enclosed area car where there's a strong nicotine smell it all lemonade that I'm viruses so it it actually kills\nThe older I'm I guess spores that are in the air it's called a cue whim um so\nWhat I Would do is I Would tell you to go to that website read about those products if you want to call them you know Monday morning and give them a call ... dumped coaches through the whole thing um compare the cost and then decide whether that's what you want to do or do you just want to ... be bored out and be done with it\nWell I'm just I'm trying to way mobsters you have to cover their return in that room ... gets you there and there's also the outside all\nDay in their ... and you know I've I've read you know or you might have molded it might be in that but if the rest of the house doesn't smell right\nAnd you can get a I'm a very accurate mold test\nUm and even that eight cue him that I just talked about that oh actually kill the mold spores that are airborne\nBut if you there's there's a a product called a five minute mold test kid it's a swab so you could swab the dust on top of the door frame everybody is dust on top of the door frame and you put us in this little boxes about the size of a pack of cigarettes and it'll tell you if it's dangerous motorists mold because we all have mould in our home\nThis just tell you if you get something that's dangerous than a home or not dangerous in the home\nSo that might be another option but I I'm really lean into the a cue whim a at the odor exit read a little bit about that maybe even talk to them and then make the decision whether that's something you want to try or you just want to get that bored out of there\nOkay All right All right we're going to show\nThanks standard take care Bye bye alright

D. P. rubber a which is much more durable which is a stick on also and then there's some with frames that are more substantial with all vinyl bowl but in the moment I'm frame that's the direction I Would go also the joint between the frame and the exterior and the interior walls might take a look it\nMay be putting some uh ... and they're the one thing I don't want you to do is don't concentrate on ... the bottom of that frame\nAnd a lot of cases if the openings or at the top or the sides and you know wind driven rain and water gets in being kind that frame if you see your clock the bottom that water cannons scape\nAnd then we hold that water in and that's why you see so many door frames that first a bottom twelve inches of the wood frame is just totally rotted\nBecause we trap that water in there so you know the ... can be done on the sides you could be done on the top but not at the bottom also take a look at the bottom of the door at the threshold there's a couple of things there that are creating a seal there's the threshold which is wood or aluminum\nOn or with a silicone and you can clean them very easily I always clean him with middle spirits\nCaught and cloth mineral spirit's just wipe down the tracks you'll be amazed at how much turkey get wiped down the glides and then just spray the tough on her silicon move the window up and down and you're in business\nAnd all that cases you're in business there's\nThere's um obviously if you have an issue with it and the parts broke and uh you got to get the part and there's a lot of window parts companies out there and you can also look on line I mean they'll have six and seven million ... million with an M but um at least you can still find parts\nFor a lot of the western window up in the northern Ohio areas one and uh there's many throughout the country really but a meat that fell to show all the dime tells me his infant Tori is in the seven million range so uh\nTake pictures trade pictures order them online\nUm any gaps or flaws in the construction around the frame um can be cocked again always be careful of clocking any piece of wood down at the base a lot of time you got to let that water Cape and talking at the bottom really can cause bigger problems\nUm weather stripping on some of the a\nVentilator double hung windows can be replaced\nAgain knowing the type that knowing the configuration of the channel a will be key but those\nWeather stripping parts can be replaced\nAnd it is just like weather stripping a door in a lot of cases just sliding it in to the channels so those are a couple of things you really want to take a look at it before it gets too uh too cold out cleaning windows and I know they just lost a lot of people they don't do windows but really cleaning windows\nOr extend the life of a window remember window glass is a liquid\nYes it's a liquid you look at\nReally really old glass eighty Ninety a hundred years old you ever knows how it's wavy\nAnd it's a liquid but a glass um needs to be clean it can get a little pits in it I'm\nIn one of the best products to for cleaning glass that I've come across is the jaws glass cleaner or J. ws I Know kroger's carries it and a lot of parts of the country now you can also get it in on line at the jaws cleans dot com\nBut I Would highly recommend that in fact it's a ph neutral there's no silver spoons or alcohol in that\nAnd what that means is you can use it on a glass like um high def TV screens computer screens getting and use it on your eyeglasses I'm the one of the things that what about yourself on screen cell phone screens another one that a lot of sensitive you got to\nUse a P. H. neutral or civil no alcohol ... glass mayor I had a friend of mine asked me the other day said actually my TV screen but now I can see kinda ... streets in it and I said\nWould you use\nThat issues in say common brand of a window cleaner and I said it's got ammonia and it got alcohol in it it'll streak that finds screen and they go well how do I get rid of it you don't\nYou don't\nUh so ph neutral or products like the jaws cleaners um\nI Would highly recommend that glass cleaner and you can also get it on Amazon meeting about that prior to it because of the spray bottle and um it's got cartridges so once you spray that onto\nThe glass and you do all these windows in your bottles half empty you don't have to go out and buy another ball you when it solve away empty can fill that up with water\nTake that cartridge and just put it in the neck of the bottle and run the spray or through it and it just versus um the concentrate in with water and you've got another bottle you're you're ready to go so um you don't have to keep buying the bottle and all that saves on storage and everything else but\nJaws cleaners a check that out another tip on clean the windows and we're talking about the weather is ... and just kind of getting things all straightened up um is some paper towels not all some paper towels have a little bit of wax and them\nSo if you're using\nA good product like a jaws where it's gonna be streak free always use a micro fiber cloth I'd stay away from the paper towel some are great I'm not trying to just knocked\nPaper towels newspaper that works good to know no ... newspapers but a micro fiber cloth ph neutral\nProduct like Charles you're not going to have any streak in a glass so then you've lubricate decide you replace the weather stripping and you clean the glass so he did a really good job of uh\nUh getting those windows are ready for winter and again just make sure they're locked when the weather gets cold another the ghetto would windows you may not realize this you can actually clock a window close\nSo you know the old double hung wood windows when the wind blows you can actually hear rattle\nAnd um I think we've all lived in a house where that was the problem and if you still have those in your house or you can tighten those up there is a product called draft stop\nAnd what you it's a clear talking that you can literally clock that ventilator closed\nCan't open in the middle of winter though a bus clock closed income march that little clear ... will simply a peel away but if new windows aren't a budget or maybe you're just you know bought an older home you're refurbishing it you cough those ventilators close take some clear plastic\nThose when the kids in put those on the front I'm telling you can take a really old\nDraftee inefficient window and you get yourself another year or two worth the life out of there and really minimize the draft are coming into your home so that's a couple of things if\nYou know I'm not really encouraging you do that right now but come January that might be something you want to take a look at if we ever really really cold winters just ... closed plastic over it [noise] you know we'll worry about replacement windows on another day [noise]\nAll right uh our phone number you can join this eight hundred\nEighty two three eight to five five happened to take your phone calls

able to now is a good time\nLines are open again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five we've been going through our weather ... that we have on our website it scary Sullivan online dot com we've kinda taken a look around the windows and around the doors\nAnd a kind of address those issues but there's other openings or in your house that you may not be aware of\nAnd uh one of 'em is there's a lot going on on the foundation of your own um and really\nTake a look at a you know on the outside above grade can always do the inside later but above grade and take a look for any types\nOf cracks in the wall themselves they always say there's more cracks on the outside then there is on the inside and if they're on the above grade there's probably some below grade too but let's address the one's above grade\nWhen you're examining the foundation and you see cracks in the foundation those can be patched up with either a zip it mortar which is a neat little package a murder that can be applied to a vertical surfaces I'm you could also use a hydraulic\nA concrete patch little darker and color in most cases and I'm also dries really fast but if it's above grade I don't think you really need the hydraulic patch you just need some zip it motor to cover it up also look at that ledge if you've got a brick house\nOr encountered this not long ago when I said really taken that walk around the house examining needs things keeps not only ... keeps insects out and\nI have a an invasion of aunts and I'm sure we can always talk about using products are getting exterminator and take care of the answer but really why not take care of their entry point into your home and when you're looking\nFor a a problems when you're doing your weather ... it and we just talked about cracks in the foundation take a look at the brick\nOr sometimes right on that foundation sometimes getting the binoculars out and just kind of looking at the whole field or bricks which you're looking for is cracked the brick\nA crack mortar missing mortar and that's exactly what I found which was right on the a ledger the foundation and that's where I was having the invasion of the ants come in and they're marching right through the mulch\nAnd up into the crack can you know we go we solved that problem by getting in\nA some patching materials ... than solving that problem but that's the type of things you're looking for a crack brick\nA missing mortar a cracks in foundations and get those things sealed up also you get utility pipe she got ... phone lines electrical lines cable lines males slots all those items that I just mentioned\nAre penetration into the envelope of your home and addressing those issues\nWith a ... keep the moisture out some parents have to do that and again whenever you're doing a like a gap between uh say gasoline is run through the foundation or phone lines or whatever\nA low expansion phone to get back into that grows and seal it up is ideal yeah you can use cooking if you want in fact if you want to finish it off with talking that's fine too but I get that low expansion phone\nThere's different types of home ... expansion low expansion if it doesn't talk about the degree of expansion of the ... expansion forms usually used for doors and windows\nSo you'd just sleep for phone for doors and windows and\nAnd that's what you'd want to use around the even the hose bibs that are going through\nThe um through the foundation also take a look at the clothes dryer vent boy I'll tell you what their big gaps around those things are great entry point for mice and a lot of places not far off the ground if you take that ... and you can just take your\nPick your hand and just see if you can shake it wobbling around I think you'll find that a lot of cases\nA ears does wobble around you\nCan connect that to the brick or the woods citing caulk around that or again getting some low expansion foam in there and then securing that good will seal that up and keep critters and called us from going in\nWas it to my son says in the laundry room was always freezing cold and sure enough\nUm that the driver vent hose ... my goodness there was an inch around that entire hose that entire vent pipe and once that was sealed up and connected certainly took care of that problem\nHer and her phone number is eight hundred eight two three eight to

week Israel fix some things up you have a house or probably a few things that are broken have an older house\nYou've probably got issues with plaster you probably got issues with wood that has rounded so river friend Richard in from amateur on which you know we're talking about all the time but ah Richard\nGot some good news Richard welcome that home of Gary\nSylvan hey Gary how you doing guys been busy haven't you it it has\nBeen busy as do all of our ... so a a ... a must be getting still rotting in\nAnd out and just keep getting older you know what it will never stop it'll never to Zachary let's talk\nA little bit about would we had a call yesterday in fact in I recommended your product it was a I think one you and I talked about many times and that was they would call them and I can't remember how old the house was whether there was a new one or old one but\nShe had some of the wood that was rotted and there were suddenly clogged underneath it so it was hold water knew it was a disaster\nAnd said you know what do I do can I mean just cannot patch it and then went yeah yeah you can yeah yeah it can you take us through that project I mean is that something a lot of us can tackle\nYeah yeah that's something we hear about all the time is a good rotting basis of columns and whether there's solid columns or whether they're how columns\nUh there's there's a there's definitely a way to fix yourself um and remain factor two different a pox the products that are ideal for making those repairs\nUm whether what starts to bed with what starts to rot\nI'm rather than having to replace entire column which you do is you use are toxic products called liquid would and where he talks and talks to patch up those bases and it's a real simple process or any of your home or can can use these products\nI'm there to talk to them and our liquid would product\nIs a penetrating pox he would heart or so\nWhere the would start school go bad and it gets a rod and hockey and saw right um what'd you do is you brush away to lose crumbling materials that that that would rock creates and then you want to saturate all that or anything with black or using that liquid with product\nAnd go liquid would will penetrate in a deep into those fibers and ultimately it solidifies and heart and all that soft material hides it all back together um and make some monolithic repair heartening all that would\nSo I'm so structurally it's throngs\nYeah absolutely absolutely the the liquid will it has a press the strength training over five thousand PSI so there's a load bearing type ... repair product chair this isn't just a just a a band date it's gonna sail last until you sell the house this is something that's going to last\nFor generations to come and uh you know just a quick quick cover up a product\nAnd then you'll take your ... moved out of the debt point\nYeah exactly so you want to saturate those routed areas with that liquid water and then uh you actually apply what a pox while that liquid would still wet\nTacky and sticky and the ... is another part of proxy but rather than be liquid this is more like a party or filler mhm and you use that to patch and replace the missing sections of all it\nSo you can fill in and rebuild or anything that's missing and you can do barrel checks and cracks and splits in the wood or you can rebuild entire\nChunks of of missing material that you need to so there's really no limitation to the to the scope or repair that you can make up something like that so\nYeah that was actually one of her concerns and I'm sure you hear this all the time and you know with a column she was getting ready to just dig all this out and she was in me whether that would be a good idea or with her column fall down basically\nAnd I'm going well you know ... you don't want to go all out right away I mean we\nYou know and then I went in explained kind of how the liquid would works and boy that is that's the tickets for the for the call because you just can't do that with any product\nBall right right yeah there's a lot of a component products on the market that uh like I said there are there ... there are there are a quick cover up type product or they're or they're meant for interior used or something like that so\nYou know when you're when you're making that type or repair you definitely want to make sure that you're using something structural unstable or something like a two part solid a proxy liquid ... types or\nNo you folks at every turn him good news about these products and no because for years or for a few years that I've been talking about that I became aware of and I know you're really involved in the restoration industry\nAnd and now reaching out to you know the white guy and it can really take care of some of these issues around their home\nAnd we were sending them ... or send the Amazon but now they can do to your local ... right\nExactly yeah we're we're pretty excited I'm Greta ... products or have just been added to the age distribution network and uh\nUh so we're we're just trying to get the word out because a lot of the white customers um they don't necessarily understand that a lot of the a stores uh and they apparently are hardware stores in stores um you know the the owners of those places are looking to those customers to find out what type of products they need\nRight now and now our liquor who would have ... products are available through that age distribution channel and so if you can't hide it at your local a store already\nA ... or ask your you know the the order the paint the paint manager that local a store and they can they can order those products right and they can they can get them on the shelf for yeah\nSure sure hum rape products and certainly make those projects that look a kind of overwhelming a obtainable and um you know as you just kind of walk through this is a project most people can tackle it to her home\nAll exactly yeah exactly are we simplified the products they're they're ... years are easy to mix there say to your ... your seas or are you asking are nasty chemicals involved with these products\nUm and you don't you don't have to be a pro you just have to be able to follow through simple instructions and uh\nAnd anybody can can use an and create a successful repair\nYou can also share than half a block on line [noise] teach

he's eighty six years old\nAnd I live with him and he asked trouble\n[laughter] because I can clean up after yourself right in any way to lean real far over\nOn he's calling me right now but I have a Lincoln toilet when he landed over\nTakes ... around the bottom on the base so so I'm On the\nOn the floor yeah so um what's going on there is a that toilet is not stabilized\nOn the floor or is it is a little bit um war and so in that toilet that sits\nAnd just to kind of give you a one on one on how that world is you've got a four inch pipe the sewer line that's coming up\nAnd you got a ... and you have a wax ring the wax ring then ... at the bottom of the toilet and two bowls anchor the ... toilet down to the floor\nOr which goes through the uh little plans and secured what's happened is all the way it's been shifted under the front either those boats have become loose they've broken probably just became loose and that seal is become compromised\nSo when we're flushing that that flush of the water in the toilet bowl is since the toilet is not sealed to lose the a pipe properly you're getting a little spill out on the sides so what\nYou need to do is you need to shut off the water you need to take that floor off the land ... I'm In that ... again you can't get a puppy nice scrape off that wax ring and then I Want you to get what they call a perfect seal it's a little bit easier to make disrepair with this Mike\nIn a perfect sealed again mounts on the ... much more durable than the wax ring even though there is a wax ring butts in case and rubber I'm In you'll tightened that up real good your ... to for a the toilet to the floor and I think you're going to eliminate your problem\nAll right my friend thank you much for the call I appreciate good luck with that in Charles welcome\nGarry Yes sir I got an interesting problem alright I had\nSome holes in my garage walls and I got those patch just fine the problem is there's a ... on the war that looks like it's them with a like a quote unquote a plaster tight finish that's kinda runny and rock\nOkay I'm Wondering how could I replicated back [laughter]\nMillion dollar question Charles I'm so there's all different kinds of techniques for that all different people have different techniques and even if you try to duplicate the same technique it's difficult\nBecause we all have our own kind of artistic touched do it so some people do um ah do use brush around brushed they'll the opposite for texture others will have a half moon or half around type trial remotest\nRick [laughter]\nUh no no no I didn't know what do you mean by gripped\nA ... it it it kind of done like in a vertical fashion and it looks like it was just going to be when they put it on the walls\nOkay well that's probably your tip 'em that's probably what they've done they probably took topping compound I Can't really visualize what the design would look like ... and I mean I'm so um my guess is they would take topping compound and a drill was the big mix or on the end of it\nAnd they would\n... the un out the ... of that topping compound and then probably take a like a wallpaper and brush uh I'm In literally do what you just said kind of drifted or whatever\nThinking yeah yeah I think in there's real low answer to it Charles I tell people try to imagine how that person put that on get a big piece of cardboard\nAnd try to replicate it you come close you probably won't be perfect but you come close but it sounds like if you're talking about but you know a dripping\nOr a a rain type a finished on there I Would use you know the topping compound diluted a in just maybe just a little bit sicker than paint in just kinda I'll use the word slap it on with a wide uh wallpaper and brush uh-huh\nThat what you're saying chopping compound would that be like using a ... a pre mixing your yup\nYup yup just use a regular um yeah pre mixed a I call ... ... and just mix more water and to get more Ramy\n... show hey that sounds like the solution\nAll right good luck tonight thank you take care of all\nWell we're fixing up all kinds of things if you'd like to join us loved the heavy it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five earlier in the show today somebody called and said men I loved that middle seat furniture polish one of my favorite products to it cleans and restores\nWoodward wood furniture in perfect for kitchen cabinets it removes the grime the dirt scratches the old wax from the wood and then restore says by the way it's also great for removing\nThe heat rings and water rings that we get on the kitchen table it's middle sick and it's ... am I.

day of Pittsburgh history I'm Pam who sales Fox News that's how the city's mayor describes the massacre that took place yesterday inside a synagogue\nIf you already know this blindness too fat\nAnd and I know exactly what you mean is just to smack of fat to get that role or to push jets flying in take a snippet of that's flying in and get the next size down there's there's only probably six different sizes\nOf blind if it's snow again you just can't quite get it down and you only got to go down to the next\nYou know the next size will will get the job done for you\nOne more I've had the most trouble with is a screening closure and it's a it's a flat and it has reached someone once you go into the group\nMhm there's a slight recession to the to the left side mhm was sacrifice fires not\nYeah I'm familiar with the flats blind to and in fact I just got done some uh this summer I have a big screened in porch in those panels all have the flats blind\nAnd I'm I'm trying to think how I chose this point I think I had some at the house\nI'm In the one I had a the first one was too big the other side's fit in just fine I put it in with the roller and I don't know if if if I if I didn't measure so I don't know\nI had one at home that was too big and I use the next I downloaded it worked fine but I I get the challenge\nUh but I think if you can measure that actual opening\nA you address the the issue but I I get it on that flight buying that can be a challenge [laughter]\nAll right thanks much down a couple of tips too if you're going to work on that um you know doing the show for thirty one years you kinda forget some of the tips you've passed along in a screening tip this time of year is a great screening tip here's the deal I'm you know the time changes next week right and so it's going to be\nDarker in the evening and we're going to get in a lot of parts of the country more the dreary time of year\nYou would be amazed at how much light is blocked by screens in your windows we got fools screens in your windows I'll bet you it's going to block a third of the light that's coming in your house may be more\nAnd if you get a good fall day papa new screens out you know if you think we're pretty much finished with opening up the windows pop that screen now take a look at the screen screen that the fiberglass screen it lifespan of that's ten to twelve years and they kind of gets thread bear\nAnd now the fall is a great time to go ahead and do your ... screening get it done on the big flat surface ... screen the screens allow more light in the wintertime\nAnd then you'll be ready to go in the springtime when they go back in ... and didn't know which one goes into\nA witch a window\nStart with the one the window closest to the kitchen sink and that's number one you just take a little sharply put number one\nRight at the top of the frame and then go clockwise around your house number\nBut replacing that a a screen now is a great time of year to do just that and the ... line that you're pushing that rubber arise a membrane into the ... the whole screen intact\nThere's ... tools looks like a big pizza cutter but then there's this line get this ... mind mice no we've got that wrong ... line mouse and it I'm\nJust check it out the hardware store as from what they look at you like you're crazy doesn't look like a pizza cutter ads of about a half circle flat in this blind rolls over to rollers and it's much easier process of pushing that's line into the groove\nSo good time of year to tackle that particular project eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five Marilyn welcome\nCarrie yeah um I\nNever I haven't heard five uh-huh [noise] I had an ear ago and I went after the latter half how I'm back here and I read the

they'll meet their demise and that'll help but they like everything else are looking for food\nAnd that's where they're going to get trapped in your little trap that you're creating but what they're living on this sounds a little gross or they're living on the bacteria in the scum that in the drains\nAll right so I I say often everything we use anymore as Jill we got Joe ... Joe ... everything's jailed and that sticky\nSo like me I use a gel a shaving cream I'm shaving in Washington dumped going down the drain but that gel even though it goes down the drain it starts slowly a coating the top of that trap or the top of the pipe inside portion of the pipe\nAnd that a gel combined with\nFlaky skin some risk yours is the bacteria in these little guys start finding it and they started feeding on that and so there is a a product\nUm that is the silliest it's actually a like a culture bacteria that creates enzymes that eats that bacteria\nOkay so we're live lead to a point were cleaning the inside of our pipes\nOkayed that particular product it's also used to a ... claw blockages and things like the current piping you he uses a maintenance product gets called drain right at her four ounces of water I think is a forget whether it's a court of water but\nWhat I'll do is like in the bathroom vanity\nOr you pull up the plug the the stopper or you put four ounces of dream but when you're a little warm water and there are ... I think it's ten minutes\nAnd you release the water it flushes down coats the inside of those pipes if there's any minor blockages it eliminates that too but that starts eating all that bad bacteria and so you've taken their food source away\nOkay can I get that at the box or am I\nAm I I picked up at eight so I think\nDo at best carries it also uh I don't know if it's in the big box stores or not\nI did take the garbage Clapper ... really\nGood I forgot to tell you about and so other people listening let's repeat that that little splash guard that rubber ice bladder we put in food it grinds and up it spits it all over the back side of that\nAnd that and it has to us right now and\nOne other question around radical I Know how how do you ever heard of that ... ... ...\nOh yeah yeah ... yeah\nWell the the ceiling probably less than the others\nBut um I'd say a polish every two weeks ... if you want it just makes that granted scream I'm so cleaning it you know whenever it gets more when I go granted does\nWe clean it with the the wipes all the time and then polish I'd say maybe once every couple of weeks or so and it makes that granite really pop usually around the holidays coming up I'll take a little spirits are water spirits the granite and if it just you know doesn't appear to be soaking in\nI let it go or if you can't over seal it so no I just got a protected\nOK

issue or a week or two ago and er during dinner I had an open bottle of beer on the table and I was just observing the fruit fly through the handful of them flying around the earth there were all landing on top of the bottle of beer\nThey like beer to do\nWhat I did I took a small park the car and put about a quarter are happening here in the bottom of it covered the top of the pizza or Saran Wrap her quiet rap or one of those classic could wrap okay security with a rubber band around the top\nAnd put a hole in the middle or I left it on the table overnight in the morning there was probably a hundred two\nHundred thousand right candidate I I like yours a it's a terrible waste of beer though don't you think now [laughter] yeah and again ... ... I had a handful there had to be a couple of is that right\nYeah the the the cider vinegar kind of the same way but I liked the idea of uh uh the cup in the Saran Wrap on top of\nThe they crawl cruelly just put a little kind of home with the tip of shrimp I sure they crawl in there they wire round but they couldn't get back out\nExcellent excellent very good Hoosier drawl problem\nThere is there certainly thank you much Martin appreciate it All right\nAll right take your really good alright used cheap beer [laughter] just just saying\nAll right let's get to a Larry here Larry\nWelcome [noise] Oh yes sir um I got a\nYear my toilet ... septic tank to my house or for toilets about a year and a half ago I started noticing that when you flush them sometimes they're flush sometimes they slowly starting to get worse [noise]\nI had to septic tank and that can fix the problem I started adding more water to bowl certainly more water when it flushed and that didn't seem to fix the problem [noise]\n[noise]\nUm it has a may checked even the vents to make sure those aren't impeded with anything\nI had went up on the road in the air Matt Bai and I didn't see anything with a flashlight but no I've not had anybody actually try to go down through them and I haven't tried to go down\nTo I mean how long ago did you have the septic pumped\n[noise] um it was about eight months ago now [laughter]\nYeah so it shouldn't be plugged up that fast I I'd kind of lean still to the house the rest of their dreams work\nThe rest of the drains were fairly well I have noticed like I said I have three toilets it started with the caller was closest to drain when Fisher Bank\n... moved to the toilet is just a little bit farther away now the toilet the harvest away from the main drank mhm still seem any flushing fine but I have noticed just a couple of weeks ago that they seem to get a little bit slower as it's going\nOkay if you put anything in there possibly to you know like a septic tank additives and we can't flush the toilet at all\nNo flush yeah you got a little ... and sometimes they'll sometimes don't just water the water drained spiral there's no actual blood [noise] um\n[noise] can you can hire any other noise ... like I'm I'm I'm back to the air vents so can you hearing gurgling in like the top or the vanity or anything along those lines\nNo I have put my ear against the main drain and it seems to be going fine\nWhen ... ... are we getting enough water transfer from the uh uh from the closet into the bowl\nAnd I added more I don't know if it's not coming down quick enough [noise]\nWell that's a common were flush or more yeah that's a common problem not so much related\nWith a septic tank but if we don't get enough philosophy of water coming from the a tank into the bowl it'll just kind of will you know sit there in a small it is a bit so that we ever to\nBoil water and ...\nYeah you might try that okay let's just try that and I was there anything\nThat I can use the kind that wouldn't be harmful to attack\nYeah the drain boat that I was talking about that would be one also um there is a a\nUm there is a septic a but if you just have a clean I'm not really sure you're going to need that I'm Still kinda concentrating quite honestly on the toilet itself\nLook at but I think with the toilet or can vent that leads and I think that I didn't try to ... stick anything down\nThat's kind of the two things are focusing on you can listen to other people calling him their ideas usually when it's a venue here some uh gurgling Larry where it's kind of like grabbing for air maybe through a drain\nAnd I work I Would think that the other drained her brain slower to Beijing dangerous\nYeah yeah so I'm kind of back to the whole velocity the flush um sometimes is poor holes just over time just get clogged in diminishes the force of the flush also\nTried adding vinegar to the back of the bowl over like a couple of weeks period time just to add more and more to it as I go and hopes to clean that out I don't know if I got clean\nAnd here's another thing you might try if you're familiar with the\nProphet called seal are taking a quart of steel aren't just pour it in the bowl of\nThe toilet let it sit overnight in case or you know that's again to see a large calcium Lyman rushed to just kind of cleans that uh we're the air Vin is and different things inside the toilet\nOr sometimes that'll solve some issues\nThere so there was a total sales in flushing yeah there's a couple of things to try and maybe the ... hours are harmful to accept the anchor it's a it's a mild acid okay sort of like the vinegar just write little stronger right\nOkay All right I'll Try that\nHope it works for you thank you much richer but by right or just

you ah were a police officer and you came upon a car that was wrapped around a tree you'd be very nervous yes this story does have a good ending okay but uh in may recently\nThe police in Nevada phone a total doubt McLaren seven twenty s near lake meat and that would make me nervous that I Would a room it was going to a hundred miles is the seven hundred and ten horse power\nTwin turbo charged V. eight car that weighs less than thirty two hundred pounds so we're talking about a a car they can get some sort of sixty in less than three something quick very quick\nWell they ran across this car and they looked up the car and they say the car was purchased just before the friday before it's a a dealership in washing your were Washington DC\nOh and they found it the next day and the great falls area\nSo there are kind of concerned\nAnd so the police department they go out and they put out a message on Twitter saying buying a high performance car which costs about three hundred thousand dollars was total and winding road by on friday total on Saturday the moral of the story that was was printed here or in the final assembly and a lot of automotive news was that\nEven a a hyper super

that picture out ... you would you would expect to come upon that vehicle and find\nRight someone not with us any All right and I know from experience that if you get a car that you think you'd understand and do something you aren't trained to do it can go bad in a hurry I've had that happen in my life for a couple of different times usually cars\nThat stick really hard and performed really well around those corner when they break\nLoose when they break loose hang on much worse than regular cars sold on this is just a good reminder\nSlowdown\nIt could cost the especially if you're driving your new McLaren as seven twenty s not a good not a good thing not a good thing at all\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's the call came in after hours\nGuys out here in the back door of two thousand viewing this heat or does or\nDoes warm air into the ... look at the crossroads warm there\nOnce the engine gets up to operating conditioned about a hundred and eighty three hundred and eighty five degrees no matter where the heat is that it starts cooling any ideas on that guy is\nSo it's fine warming up so it has heat\nWhen it's still warms up yeah the bad thing about that is a lot of cars that have head gasket issues that start blowing exhaust gases into the cooling system when it's fully warmed up\nAnd interrupting the cooler full they act like that as they start up and they're starting to warm up oh great cooler warm air warm or hot air now the temp uses up that way of colder and it'll switch back and forth as you drive down the road and accelerate the celery\nThat's one of the that's a possibility\nYou could be is the complete failure of one of the fresh air vents are where it would be ducking right past year corps fresh outside here right or\nElectronic temp sensor in the car that once it warms up as it is it changes I mean those are a couple of things we would be leaning towards doing a head gasket check on a vehicle like that is the ... with the with the gas tests or\nHow do you do that but yeah it's a pretty simple primary under\nKept comes off when you make sure there's no pressure do don't blow it off this is somewhat shop needs to do what they were to remove the cap they would use this for the or a full bottle whenever you apply laws draws gases from the radiator just there are no coup through this two filled with liquid a couple of separate compartments and as it goes through\nIf there's hydrocarbons which is anything that's in your\nTailpipe coming out in that cool which there should be none of it indicates there's they crack a block or a or a gas leak immediately turns colors from usually from blue to yellow when you you\nGot a problem was that doesn't occur there's a good indication that it's something else but that's a quick cheap test to find out what's going on\nOur heads gas gets better these days or has my life changed as I've become an adult\nYeah and well here's part of it though they've started going to similar mated metals between the head the block okay a lot of our head gasket problem scheme in when we had aluminum cylinder it's sitting on top of a cast\nIron blocks and so you had different properties of cheating different properties of the of the ability to to flex under heat\nAnd marrying the too doesn't always work great but when I was in high school a ten year old car was a Nineteen eighty car so they were more likely to be well and and even before that you had cast iron on top of caster ... which wasn't as much of a problem\nBut when they started getting in the middle ground where they had a looming them on top of Kashmir and that's when we started seeing more ... more ... more problems with head gasket in in in the gas gets now as we've advanced\nWe have got aluminum blocks aluminum heads and also you are in some situations not pushing 'em the pressure or through the system that you were on the other ones but I think the bigger issue would probably be the fact that the coolant properties have gotten better\nUh I think people are more\nIn tune with coolant maintenance than they probably were ten years ago\nI think that ... maintenance used to be looked upon in a similar fashion as break fluids maintenance maintenance is today replace it when there's a week exactly yeah and they didn't realize the ability for that coolant to build up\nAlkaline properties and metallic properties just based on its use through the vehicle and and those are the things over time if it's not replaced and that that cool and gets whether it be too acidic or to have you in one property other it'll start\nShe's going away at the gas gets and eventually cause the cause of leak and so I think that the combination of some of those things have changed so we don't see those those normal offenders like we usually would still seeing a lot of it out there\nThanks for joining us on the under the hood show until next time you can find us on line you can find is under

lights with the cameras to play back mark when we went to a break you said something about adding ten seconds\nBefore before what before you see right so what happens is the the cameras are always recording in memory or in buffer so when we're when we do have ... in a sense and weak in the video clip up to the cloud we put that ten seconds onto the front of the video so nothing's missed\nSo if a if a driver or a FedEx or UPS drivers dropping off a package you actually when you watch the video you actually watch the driver walk up to your house and put the box on your porch ring the doorbell

two three eight to five five and Diane welcome\nMhm how can we help me yes\nWell I heard a click the cattle and ... with a camera now what happens is that many perfect like ... or ... is that possible and cover it so they can't do nothing\nOr sure I mean if they if they cover the camera that I mean obviously it's going to block the share of the um the viewing of the camera the you know the good news about the cameras are very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there was a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten seconds buffer though right yeah you because you've got to walk up you got to get to the camera they've already got John camera and on video so\nYeah there's also when other small feature we actually have a status light it's a little um indicator light\nThat used to tell you you know different colors blue it means it's on line but if you really want to be you know income need or you can actually turn that light off in the app so that little blue light is not on the person does not see that when they woke up to your door so but\nVery good question oh Diane you're thinking\nThere's not a lot that goes off on your phone at how many were actually not a light off the face so to speak\nNo you would just get your normal notification greeting someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app that does sound an alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button the light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\nI think you're right not All right Diane thank you to care so it is smart importer than we already said how their day to three\nTo five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome\nI ah I have a question we shoot the runaround what trick or treaters\n... yes I mean the um you know if you have the porch lights on your front door um I mean it's designed to pick a motion within say ten Fifteen feet your porch area\nBut you can set in the Arab you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nI'm so yes it will pick it up the other hand you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier I mentioned it now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard you know you look out your window you can see them um\nYou can go into the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button live she can do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard is in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um if you want to start recording you just hit the record button and historic recording that activity\nOr any kind\nOf curious 'cause we are very true life you know our law turned off\nEvery ten minutes without turning around the house\nAnd go running if there's a way to get the sense that\nThey're absolutely there's two things one is you can you can control ... literally would just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera\nAnd you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to the actual activate the motion and the camera and beyond that you can actually turned into a bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down so you I call it tuning so when she saw the product you can kinda tune\nYou know which alert you want to get the ones that matter and that again we've built on that features into the product in the app very cool and\nThen see that's man you gotta think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by\nThe questions again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five she'll a welcome\nHello yes\nI was wondering like how do you have any generators that are run by ... or any solar panels or how Kyle or anything like that\nWell they're selling the security lighting but that's something you could add to your home but these things are are they go ahead I'll be quiet [laughter] okay so let me well I don't\nI mean I don't know how to share okay well ... actually today\nMarks ready to go with your ... question he he may I think he's got an answer\nYes so one one feature we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line so if the power goes out on your home\nNo matter where you are there'll be a mess he gets into your phone and it says that the the cameras off line so at least you know that is off line for some reason which is usually it's a user either the wife dies out okay or the power's out we don't offer um any type of supplemental power this time we get that question it's something that we're learning that\nThink it's crazy but really crazy at my now literally her\nTo catch I and I kept hearing that that might well yeah I\nYou can pick up the podcast angel again we we got that on our website scary solving online dot com but one of the questions I have for you as we we hit somebody actually concerned about that also\nIs and again did they have any video of this happening at all now yeah but I'm the ... and on this particular product is ... ... this maximus lighting that wouldn't be a problem though\nRight we're gonna we're gonna one of the videos is to send him to the cloud we actually I'm at ten seconds before the motion sensor goes off we we bolted onto the front of the video so you would get the person coming up to the door\nAnd see them in the video before the damage whites keep in mind though are cameras integrated into the light fixture is not a like a lot of other products are separate cameras you can easily spot right this is actually it is to a ball that's on the bottom of the light fixture that\nMost of the time you don't even know what's there yeah it looks like a ... coach would know that the camera's there unless you're really looking forward\nTo but if you did you have that extra ten seconds which is awesome unavoidable\nWere catch him don't worry we're going to catch him yeah\nSecond on that answer possibility that the only way we do I mean sure possibly a building that\nOkay we watched the first stole a car and insurance to keep them tying having sort of\nOur vehicles to electric\nWell I mean we can we are re integrated though with a with Google Home an election which is now in your vehicle so I suppose that bridge could could be done yeah I had at the first time I've heard that question it's a good\nOne that's a great college that one day yeah sure yeah but in the Google it certainly could be up there are sure\nI'm In love at\nGreat thank you very good thanks angel\nAppreciated and again these are available at Costco it's available at home depot got smart listeners I'm telling you what right there and there were actually\nThe promises and other stores to I Know there's not not every storm blows

I have a radio ad high check out our talk radio studio during a brand new episode with the legendary sir Paul McCartney\nNo I'm In treat them with Joe leading to talk about his new album Egypt vision and of course some discussion about it a little band called the lead off we were when we were playing music or radio present in the city yeah check it out now\nAbout Saudi Arabia I'm Pam who sounds Fox News\nIf if you please but my real question is simple and easy is do you have to run the suckers twenty four seven because I'm a if you don't you know I can cut a fifty to a hundred dollars probably right there and then on my ...\nYou're right right well that's a great question a demon of fires are very expensive to operate a lot of people don't realize that even a little tiny portable ones yeah\nWas misled I was told when about pest control company when it was done that it would have your house so playing on an eighth and it is\nYou know it died in Ninety five degrees outside you can set up I don't eat there and enjoy yourself\nYou know but um I was\nTold that that money saved from that and sledding factor would be more than it would cost to run the date humidifiers and it's actually had virtually no effect that I can notice on any of the heating or cooling\nYeah I'm so when it's running twenty four hours a day what is the humidity level inside your home\nThe humidity level and shot at my home ah has traditionally and continued to be a little high ...\nOr ... even in areas like from one side to the other you know how they said today humidifiers\nA ... is the extremity on the kitchen side I'm a little higher and extra extremity on the master bedroom sat on the opposite as a little higher\nDo you have any idea what the percentage is the the percentages I mean is it below fifty as it above fifty or\nIt's below fifty but I'm a I've had some pushing and went to this because uh even though I'm a figure as guy the humidity humidity is not what am I right things but uh I think I've heard figures and a half thirties or around forty you know\nWell in all honesty were really where you want to be as in the winter time if you can kick it around thirty five forty that's fine but I think it's a stretch if you can keep it below fifty in the summer I think you're doing great\nOkay well my concern though is underneath the house and that was mode and every time we had the rabbit treat it\nRang wheel and it was probably run in Seventy percent then\nAnd and so once it was traded the um\nThe humidity has been unbelievably low underneath a house\nOr what they do they put the plastic on the ground and help yeah yeah they totally encapsulate so you have lemonade and all that water vapor\nWhile you're talking like a Fifteen thousand dollar deal\nRight right and I know exactly how much ...\nJoined I really Eighteen negotiate if you work on it\nRight but your question is do I need to use those humid fires all the time basically how\nCould I possibly maybe once a month a run 'em for about three days\n[noise] uh I Can't answer that because I don't know how much in flux of humidity is you've changed the environment by using vapor barriers and different things like this I tell you what I Would do\nJust totally locked and you know yeah I mean his hair free all your van ship and closed off and everything right\nSo what I Would do is I Would go in I Would buy a little like weather station that's about the size of a book you can put that up in your bedroom or your hallway or wherever you want\nAnd then the sensor you just place that down into the crawl space area it's going to give you the temperature and it's going to give you the humidity and you're gonna watch it\nAnd you know maybe there is times you can turn that off if it's really really hot really humid I'd just be real curious to know and I don't think you have to answer yet what that humidity level is busier you miss that on the humidifier\nI think underneath a house home to this but I think I heard figures like Eighteen or something like that you know Eighteen what on the humidity or reading or whatever\nOh it's way too low yeah you'll never needed that low\nYeah well I was told by another past guy that it might or pure hardwood floors you know if if you if it's too much\nAgain I think you wanted at fifty percent okay in the summertime below forty percent in the wintertime I Will get a sense are down there and the weather station so I could just manually monitor monitor it\nBy one of those from lows sure sure\nAnd then you can see what's going on and if you got it off for three days and all of a sudden that humidity level starts creeping up to fifty five sixty percent you turn it on you drive it down to maybe I don't know forty five percent\nQuestionnaire unless I'm abusing your time or the pope puppets of a it's a um one and a half horse and that's eight and me and about a hundred and thirty dollars a month right\nI was told by ... guy off or ... that once the temperature of the water hit sixty five and below chemicals added or a moot point because it doesn't react to the\nThat may be I I don't know that okay like that that that makes sense since it's logical for me that that that does make sense so at that point why have the filter or why of the bumped going Jim we got to\nGo but monitor that humidity no there's no sense in running the humidifier if you don't need it now however you gotta remember when you got 'em going full blast where are you right around fifty percent so you turn them off I\nGot to think it's probably going to go up a little bit but the cooler it is outside and you got a big cold front come through Florence\nWhen it gets cooler it's usually less humid and maybe it's something that you can deactivate him at that point ... monitor where your humanity level is\nAll right thanks so much for the call I appreciate your welcome to join us our phone number's eight hundred eighty two three

you\nHear me talk about a political mill see can we have Chris with us from mill think Chris welcome that almost Gary Sullivan\nWarning Gary how you doing I'm doing great how about you not too bad\nThere you go so you heard the stage kitchen cabinets I don't know around the handles probably most people's ah unless they're always using ... you're probably gonna find that a black grimy oily substance around the handles of cabinets or even on the doors of kid myths and tell us a little bit about ... it's got a long history\nYeah scary most likely to develop back in Nineteen fourteen by Hungarian immigrant mhm resulting second he was a master cabinet maker and you know products of is fun creations and that's when most like furniture polish and cleaner was developed and really that's what makes you know sex so unique is that it's a cleaner and polish\nIt'll take that Greece and grime off those kitchen cabinets and restore the would do its natural lost her like you said especially when they're on the handle your gang you get the grease on your hand you're opening cabinet doors we get that build up and no Sacco clean right down to the finish\nSo that grime we have is that cooking oil or what is that grime recombination ... several things I guess huh\nExactly it's a combination it's from ... from the oils in your hand on the Greece's you're cooking on and not all gets on to the cabinet and you don't have to use another uh you know use it ... other products you have to clean 'em and then go back and Paul ... or ... clean and polish almost up now\nWhen you use the word polish I I Know people use different spray cleaners different spray wax is to give them a little luster but even that wax over time get soft and grimy correct\nRight you if you use products ... over the years you get that build up where you can almost greater where you're\nFrom there yeah yeah no sec doesn't have any ... in fact no sick remove all that ... up and clean right down to the finish show on your dining room table you get a heat ring\nThat white ... networks built up someone such hot cat on there and it kind of ... so since no sec removed wax built up it'll take that heat ring right off the dining room table a watering off the coffee table\nAnd it will certainly have a lot of those calls in the next two months I guarantee you so ah so the ... there's no whack sitting there in yet it cleans what what's the secret sauce and you can't tell me the secret but uh I mean\nIt it's gotta be something special is silicone or no silk ...\nBuilt up as well right on your furniture and our our our furniture polish doesn't have any water and it it's pure cleaning and polishing ingredients in their trade secret ingredients and house formulated and allows or product to do what it does\nSeem so anything that would have bought laminate because limit cabinets and stuff like that they get grimy to working on it\nRight laminate painted cabinets um it's even get on your hardwood floors and lemon at floors\nYou got to lose their directions on the bottle you I don't think they looted quarter cup a gallon of warm water and you'd be amazed by the dark that listen to shine it leaves behind\nNow does it have to be diluted for the cabinets are just like the floors just for for\nJust for the floors otherwise use it straight and I guess you just put a little bit on it or on a rag is\nYeah you're just actually if you slightly dampen your towel and then at the mill sector the towel that activates the [noise] the cleaning agent in our products soda and clean and polish at the same time you're even candle watch you know we had to hurricanes down south and\nOr using candles that candle wax gets on the dining room table Romney what surface Nosek room that came to wash right off the\nTape very cool because it's removing wax never thought I had excellent excellent now you've got a number of products the ones we're talking about is the wood cleaners and rejuvenating years do those have sense\nTo it I'm Sorry do they have\nSmells to it I mean I Know you've got the lemon\nRight our furniture polish comes in a in three varieties our original lemon oral since Nineteen fourteen okay we have an orange\nOil and this far holiday oil is out it's a sentiment raspberry Christmas that we produce in the fall and mix of house no real Christmas yeah and they all clean and polish shame she get the same performance as the original I'm an oil except for you have a nice Christmas ...\nWhere are you also ... also has a I think the greatest stainless\nSteel a cleaner and I don't know whether it just leaves just a little film on it but when I use it on my stainless steel refrigerator and I don't get the hand prints like I Do with regular cleaners it it almost protects it to a degree\nYes our stainless steel cleaner is so easy to use it to a portable liquid it's not a ... you don't have to wait before from the ever spray port on a cloth wipe the with a grain of the stainless turn your tower run a dry hot and dry and when that comes becomes completely dry it'll even be become more fingerprint resistant\nYeah man forget like kids in your house to the don't need those hand prints all over it it it really does protect at stainless steel and make a different a difference also your leather a product of leather couches but that leather product is

uh\nYou know yes yes nothing ... nothing they can say about that [noise] All right against eight hundred eight two three eight to five five a Janelle also posted the question on her Facebook page and it says hey Gary heard you talk about this someone about give its are holes\nIn a driveway from ... is the word it's when the surface of the concrete just pops up holes are about a quarter inch deep\nAnywhere from two inches to four inches in diameter and um the product you used for that she wants to know what to use for that what you do is you will remove any of the residue from the spoiled area you would remove any dust\nFrom the spoiled area then when then you would come back and you would wet that area down you use the hose you need to use the pressure washer you just want that hydrated\nAnd you wanted as clean as you can get it then the patching material is a quick creep ... product is called vinyl\nConcrete catcher in Daniel I um I don't know if you're writing it back to him but we might want to do that to a violent is vital concrete patch or and that can be applied up to a half inch in thickness it's a powder you mix it with water\nAnd you let sit for about five minutes and it's a it's not a slurry it's a patch it's almost like butter in a tub at that point and you can use a trial you could use a white taping knife and literally just go around and just move\nOver those bald marks on the driveway or the negative of that of course is no concrete matches\nOne concrete from the neck so if you have a very gray concrete or this might be a little lighter than that if you have your from the south and you've got a little reddish concrete this is a little more than a great side than they do so tense if you've got a lot of it\nAnd of course there's also products that re surface the entire surface of the concrete\nSo that might be something to but the name of the product is modern concrete Thatcher\nYou can find it and most any hardware store or big box store or a dig in to get a question on board simply Dallas up at eight hundred eight two three eight to five five with Facebook pages Gary Sylvan public on way for the day and we've got all kinds of things\nTo do now [laughter] you liking your job today [laughter] so um yeah [laughter] well you can't say because it gets taken off the air [laughter] so a year\nSo you could also go like it's that or our Facebook page Gary some public figure and a poster questionnaire and we can get that answered also in the number is eight hundred eight two three eight to five five it sounds a little bumpy it's the first time we've tried it and\nSo I wanted to give it a whirl and see if that's something to make our show a little bit easier\nTo handle for you as you a\nTravel around on the on the weekends I wanted to pass that along a again that ... sale is going on that goes through Monday\nAnd uh we do have podcast on our website scary Sullivan online dot com or we're talking about the chimney and I hit a chimney sweep on a yesterday and I asked him if he has backed up all the way to Thanksgiving I think he kind of said close [laughter]\nSo when I can kind of start warn you in August ... encourage you may be to do something in terms of getting the chimney inspected um that's really the best time to do it right now every chimneys sweep a that is worth his salt is busy\nAnd there's an association if you're going to call someone to inspect your Jimmy it's a C. S. I. a certified chimneys sweep and a lot of cases are almost all those guys have cameras where they can literally inspect the inside part of your chimney if there's a problem they can show it to you\nAnd I think that's really important\nThat they can actually show it to you\nSo ah anyway\nThat something if if you didn't get your Jimmy inspected and I know you may have to wait a little bit but I Would definitely get on their list\nRight again ah well Mark's got a question mark welcome or a comment hello hey Gary how you doing today and good sir\nI just want to let you know I order that ...

I'm calling from Connecticut a bike sister was remodeling her house and they were carrying out the shelling and on the whole big huge beer part of the feeling\n[laughter] and it was just stuffed in there\nThey were always sitting up there and they happen in a a ... in the feeling\nYeah scared the heck out of them my bed huh\nI sure did I thought I'd tell you that [laughter]\nYeah you did some you're not really expecting probably insulation though huh I don't know why is there but she had told me that there you go I thought it was interesting story to tell you very good thank you much\nOkay by by ... by by you know there's a lot of stories and then we'll get back to some insulation questions again eight hundred eight two three and a question\nOf Facebook for you you got a question of Facebook Daniels has a question on Facebook not me but uh the listener Louis there was the question excuse me I had to take a drink of water there well you know stage Fred will get you every time\nA yeah says my garage has to drains one on each side in both cases the water drains off the cars in every direction but to the drains and he can do\nSo the floor is nuts slopes properly that's interesting\nIs there anything else you can do now I don't know you got to get the slope the water's got to get to the dream\nSo I guess one of the things you could do is you could put a thin layer of concrete or a concrete re servicing product around the rest of the garage floor to elevated so that in fact it does slope towards the green but that'd be a challenge\nEither going to add or you're going to remove also grinding some of the floor could create some slope and get the water to the drain it also might be better Daniel really just to put a curtain brain around\nThat area and you use that during\nWell that's interesting I used to you know ... they're not always trout properly I had before I'd put nature stone on my garage floor I always had this giant puddle\nAnd it was just you know it's been very much for drain in fact at one time I was going to install drain there and just move the water out but my wife is right next to her car\nAnd I'm so or temp she a car\nWas wintertime and she had drug some snow into their garage this tunnel formed she's stepping in it but when we had the nature stone installed we actually leveled out that floor\nAnd then put the nature stood on top of that was from Robert fissure by the way very good thank you Robert All right let's get Peter on in the Peter welcome\nWell thank you very much for taking my call you up here in Massachusetts where when\nClosed enclosed porch was slap a and we decided the calls and created an office\nOr and will be in ... to get right now just all framed in seal but it's a concrete or should we put panning on topic right on the concrete or should we at a sub or for a little bit of insulation or and make more warmer\nWell you you could do that that would be probably um your best bet to get it off that concrete of there's a product called dry core and a dry core\nPeter is um maybe sixteen inch squares of wood that hip polypropylene feet that may be extended up three eighths of an inch\nAnd their tongues in groups so you can literally set this whole floor together and it's elevated\nRight and that's good too because um that concrete\nCould get cold and then if it's heated you could get sweating\nSo given that whole thing off the floor is a real good idea\nThat's what we're thinking of the ... the concrete slab is likely and gold obviously to bring the water away from the house correct so so a contract that was going to sort of a cut out to buy or whatever is working so it kinda evens\nOut a little bit so okay that quite a coast guard somewhere other than the right to wreck\nYour head or right direction there's also a product so that was called dry core there's also a a ... for carpet um in fact they've got a four limits and they got it for carpet to different products it's called DNA mix\nAnd even though he mixes a insulating had that him as a like ... on it or a little feed on it and so again\nIt's elevated so if there's any moisture sweating you know it it can evaporate out the sides\nOkay ... so that it might be that or during this up for re should All right\nGood thank you my friend among Bye bye yeah those are two good products threat situation no question about it All right judge Judy welcome you're at home with Gary Sullivan\nHi Gary hello you were talking about the escalating the column face and I've got a different kind of question for you [laughter]\nI had a couple of guys and it might have to have two years ago and ... replacing outside profit from it that way [laughter] and the one guy he said he was really impressed with with the space\nThat I didn't go under I could see everything on end of the house 'cause there's like Bob down there and it it it insulated I could see an area where I'm Talking about underneath the you know actually the floor and paper facing is on the outside but\nIt's all covered over with tar paper ... mhm so is that three up all\nWell no I don't think it would be um how sick is that insulation ... it's not over three inches thick isn't\n[laughter] I couldn't tell I live now without training they sitar paper that cross faced guy it can be okay there\nIs no more than a ... they were putting a

work\nFor those warm air into the ... part not the cross propose warm there\nOnce the engine gets up to operating conditioned about a hundred and eighty three hundred and eighty five degrees no matter where he just said it starts flowing cold here and the idea is that is\nSo it's fine warming up so it has heat when it until warms up yeah the bad thing about that is a lot of cars that have had gas\nTheir shoes that start blowing exhaust gases into the cooling system when it's fully warmed up interrupting the cooler full they\nAct like that as they start up and they're starting to warm up oh great cooler warm air warm or hotter now the temp you know when it's colder and it'll switch back and forth as you drive down the road and accelerate the celery that's one of the that's a possibility\nThe only other thing you could be is the complete failure of one of the fresh air vents are where it would be ducking right past year corps fresh outside here right or\nElectronic temp sensor in the car that once it warms up since ... and it changes I mean those are a couple of things we would be leaning towards doing a head\nGasket check on a vehicle like that it's the ... with a with a gas tests or how do you do that whether it's a pretty simple primary under kept comes off when you're mature there's no pressure do don't blow it off this is somewhat shop needs to do what they were to remove the cap they would use is or the or a full bottle whatever your applause\nDraws gases from the radiator just there are no who went through this two filled with liquid a couple of separate compartments and as it goes through if there's hydrocarbons which has anything that's in your\nTailpipe coming out in that cool which there should be none of it indicates there's the crack a block or a or a gas leak immediately turns callers from usually from blue to yellow when you\nGot a problem was that doesn't occur there is a good indication that it's something else but that's a quick cheap test to find out what's going on\nOur head gas gets better these days or has my life changed as I've become an adult\nYeah and well you here's part of it though they've started going to similar mated metals between the head the block okay a lot of her head gasket problems came in when we had aluminum cylinder it's sitting on top of a cast iron blocks\nAnd so you had different properties of heating different properties of the of the ability to to flex under heat\nAnd marrying the too doesn't always work great but when I was in high school a ten year old car was a Nineteen eighty car so they were more likely to be well and and even before that you had cast iron on top of caster ... which wasn't as much of a problem\nBut when they started getting in the middle ground or they had a looming them on top of castor that's when we started seeing more oh yeah more more problems with that gas gets in an intake gas gets now as we've advanced\nWe ever got aluminum blocks aluminum heads and also you are in some situations not pushing 'em the pressure or through the system that you were on the other ones but I think the bigger issue would probably be the fact that the cool with properties have gotten better\nUh I think people are more\nIn tune with coolant maintenance than they probably were ten years ago\nI think the court maintenance used to be looked upon in a similar fashion as Greek fluids maintenance maintenance is today replace it when there's a lead exactly yeah and they didn't realize the ability for that coolant\nTo build up alkaline properties and metallic properties just based on its use through the vehicle\nAnd and those are the things over time if it's not replaced in that\nThat cool and gets whether it be too acidic or to have you in one property other it'll start\nShe ... away at the gas gets and eventually causes the cause of the week and so I think that the combination of some of those things have changed so we don't see those

you know you got your work cut out for\nYou so can you put insulation on top of insulation for the most part yes the only way you wouldn't want to do is if you had a vapor barrier that was a on top of the insulation which I Hope you don't have\nUsually a vapor barriers facing down towards the living area of the house and let's say five six inches you know you got to add another ten twelve inches on top of that and you can put batting down on your face batting\nOr you get below insulation in and you could blow a cellulose insulation and you could blow fiberglass insulation you don't want to cover up to solve advance if he had old wiring up there you don't want to cover that up in fact you shouldn't insulate over at all ever never\nYou have over a candlelight you want to make sure that they're protected you don't want to do this\nIt over them but for the most part not a difficult job\nIf you want to lay bats over that's fine bats are not quite know the you know they're still gonna be a gap between the would up in the addict that the ... the presses there's going to be a little scene there where's your blowing it and it's kind of film and all that area\nBut just adding insulation real good idea and get it up to speed the LA Times your department of energy will tell you okay for new constructions are this is remodeled should be our this but you know somewhere in between if you're just sitting up there for five inches of insulation you you got some work to do\nAnd also when you get up there just kind of take a look it's crazy what you're finding your attic fine mold on the underside of the roof maybe some rotted would maybe you've gotta moisture issue\nMaybe there's dead birds in there maybe there was some critters that we're living in there and the nest was made in the insulation\nSo that's telling you you got a problem you've got to breach somewhere in the middle of that house it needs to be repaired\nAnd maybe that old insulation needs to be removed at that point\nBut a lot of times it's outside it's Adam mind\nAnd that's not always a good option so when it comes as we said just start keeping the cold air out that's a real good place to start is the ad against elation and just get up there and take a look and see what's going if you're not capable of getting up to get somebody to get up there and take a look at it or do an energy audit\nAnd address those issues eight hundred ... two three eight to five five that's our number Mike welcome\nSir how you doing doing great\nRight now I'm a ... a cabin down in Santa Fe on the Tennessee River uh-huh I've got a guy will too\nBut I kinda like at that rate foam inflation uh-huh have you or your money going to do is to lie for you right while\nAnd the crowd things underneath it it got on the side of

raptor but then they rolled out some kind of in the late ... now certainly inflation unit hung in group filling in it mhm but I have no way to get that phone stay up and then do the\nDominant very we should just spray the top of the roof okay ... prior to the root\nMhm mhm so there's not going to be any venting in that in that room correcting we're just going to encapsulate that whole ... area correct\nThat lady okay you know and I don't need to do any um property Sony if he does it that way\nThat is correct so what you're talking about is actually pretty trendy my kids started probably Fifteen Years ago yeah you're a trendy guy can tell\n[laughter] older guy\nI'm not going there I'm not going there so uh [laughter] to answer your question yeah about Fifteen\nYears ago a company called ice ... started this process of whole house in ... and ... and it really is it makes an entire insulated Ava low to the house\nFrom the roof all the way down to the side walls it doesn't require softened venting it doesn't require a roofing a roof venting because basically that attic area becomes a conditioned area now so if you had air conditioning or heating that becomes a conditioned area so it's\nKind of all in one in terms of the house very very cost effective very very energy efficient\nVery quiet in that house now the challenge because there's nothing that's ever

B. C. company if you're dealing from a company has been around a while has a great reputation they're not going to carry junk because they're going to warrant that for a long time\nAnd they're going to be there for you so finding that good technician that's what you want to do\nSo anyway just getting nothing inspecting\nGetting it done or the key and please if you get a carbon monoxide detector in that house\nSmoke alarm in the house you could\nSay that about year round but it's really important in the wintertime if you're not having that furnish checked in the chimney inspected potentially there's things that can go wrong and we'll hear about the news\nHouses get closed up and then this family hadn't a carbon monoxide problem and\nYou know somebody passes away somebody's ... the whole family is very sick you you want to get that taken care of it in one of the things that is interesting over the years I've done different stories and carbon monoxide if you feel like the whole family's got the flu but when the kids go to school they feel fine\nAnd you don't have a carbon monoxide detector they may not have the flu they may have mild carbon monoxide poisoning 'cause that's\nWhat it's like you can smell it you can't see it but the effects of the human body is flu like symptoms interesting yeah\nSo uh I you know this one lady I talked to their family had a criminal oxide problem when the kids went to school and went to an overnight and one of their friends' house\nKids weren't sick lady when she went to work she was sick\nShe got home she'd be watching TV should have a headache just feel lousy wake up the horrible good work feel good\nHuh and what it was the the the pipe that go into the chimney was cloth\nAnd didn't have an inspection and as soon as we're going right into the um so make sure you get a carbon monoxide detector that's very very important\nAh John welcome morning how are you doing good right thing for show you\nA couple of questions here a one a\nRoute a tile floor or the or the town for the ground in the middle or what is the best way to\nIt's it's almost like a [noise] a why is what it used to be I'd like to bring it back to why what is the best way to do that and it's at at the ... oh yeah yeah I mean\nThere's people that do it they'll steam cleaned drought and stuff like that but uh you can use different um like a grand a gold they make a ground stone cleaner it's going to take some scrub and\nCan use a Mr cleans scouring the sponge or that a plane and then the secret is to get that um get that sealed and that's the key getting killed so\nI mean in the path to clean it but it just seemed like the material that I purchased a you know didn't clean it like a [noise]\nMore than you there yes you could always tell that it was wider over there\nWell I'll tell you what I just clean some grout um with some um granted go route cleaner and then I see that with the sealer and we're just talking to my wife and I are just talking about this this morning and it's amazing how it has not come back\nBecause the water ruse cells moisture penetration into that ground so it does that mold John I'll get to the rest of the question off the air we're up against the are up against the clock don't forget\nUh my favorite product got her brushed\nBut tell you what if the leaves have fallen in your house to get the leaves out of the gutter get them cleaned if they haven't politically ball and\nAt this point just wait till they completely fallen clean the gutters and get some gunner brush slide it in cheaply leaves from

that's a pretty much regional issue\nBut again just being aware of things that can happen is again reason to make sure that had a furnace or air handler is\nUm inspected and maintained I said that's an interesting issue though isn't it isn't that amazing alright eight hundred eight two three eight to five five Marilyn welcome\nGarry low you for taking my call you bet\nWe have a quick patio annoy side of our house and about two months ago we prayed when I get on that\nBecause we had to do that to the algae uh-huh well in fact now but I I prick for like a skating rink and we we Pakistan yesterday and we were going to do it again of course ... training that we wanted to know their wedding forget what the hell I'm On ... [noise]\n... well well hold on you use the wet and forget correct\nYou go to your mind again okay did to get rid of it are no\nGood okay we got a lot of tree okay and in fact the attack\nAnd is it back in the exact same place where it was yeah\nWell that that surprises me a little bit in Maryland because the wedding forget it does do a complete kill and the complete kill should I'm not going to say prevent because that's too big of a word let's say slow down the progression of re growth\nUh so it does leave they I I guess it would leave a little bit of a film nothing that you should be able to see nothing that should be slippery but um since it is a complete kill it should take longer\nFor the ... growth to take place now you say there's a lot of woods and a lot of shade so ... so yeah so let's do this um I think that whole problem is telling us something\nWe can certainly use the wet and forget again and the ... you know it works um in it'll kill it\nBut I think we need to get that brick sealed\nOh I don't think what's going on remember the mold the middle do the algae to fungus the like and all that keen grow unless there's moisture\nSo we've got a shaded area we got a lot of ah um dust that's on that broke we got a lot of a morning dues in ... and he keeps that brick wet\nAnd if that brick isn't waterproof per se it wicks that moisture in in its um it holds that brick or holds that water net brick\nFor a longer period of time so if we get to a mold the bill doing everything off and then we use a brick ceiling\nOr brick waterproof and 'cause you don't really want to seal it you want to allow water from the backside to transfer through it but the rain water you want to keep it from absorbing into the brick and then I think what will have is we'll have that problem pretty much fixed up\nNorth side of the house and it kind of year we ... we hardly ever get any\nSense right right right right and how old is the house\nOr the house forty eight years old okay but get now patio with cutting last fall okay but we did not feel it\nOkay so this is on the patio this was on the floor so that kind of a verbs right\nYeah we had company can now they got it yeah it was a name and what is\nIt yeah you need to get that sealed there's no question about it so you can get out as so we can spray the wedding forget on their if you'd like or if you want something\nUm that's immediate so you can do it you know in a day or two um we could use like a high grade a a missionary cleaner\nIn fact there's a website let me just give you that Marilyn and you can decide which way you want to go okay we know the wedding forget work so but we also know it's going to take four weeks to get it to clean and the time of year we might want to move a little bit faster\nSo it had to do that when I get\n... probably I I don't have the label in front of me\nI had on the label 'cause we read that\nOkay well if it doesn't ever precaution know it can be spread anytime then okay okay but um the the website I Want\nYou to look at is called masonry defender\nNathan Mary defender ray\nAnd what they've got his they've got a main street cleaner\nIt's a high grade oxygen they bleach which I recommend it for years it's you mix it with water you spray it on your weight about ten minutes then you take like a big street broom in your scrub scrub scrub pick your hose rinse it off\nAllow that brick to drive for a day or two and then apply their paver sealer all that there's there there's websites got six products on it [laughter] okay so it was real easy to find an order right on line and are you what the ... cleaner and then the brick paver sealer\nAll right well that's you\nKnow there you're probably make a big difference getting that sealed really will keep that a brick from observing that water it'll make a big difference\nWhere I'm going into winter we got to be cautious everybody comes in the back\nDoor yeah yeah All right thank you so much for your help alright

Ninety five percent of home leaky duct work and another misconception that's out there and then you know you might hear someone say well I have a new ...\nMinute effort can delete well it's just because you put two pieces of anything together and it's prone to having you know points have leakage\nNow you may not know this in fact I Know you don't know this but was Seventeen years old my job was to run Duckworth uh-huh [laughter] and I don't think duck works installed like this anymore because what I used to have to do and I had to do it right that when we put those two foot pieces together\nWe'd have to run little heck said screws\nAnd make sure those duck works were connected I'm not so sure that's done anywhere anymore\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean there's there are and different approaches to the installation of growers and that the setting of the the two PIN and certain states across the country have codes now that require that for me the old when it's installed\nThough when you were saying that Ninety five percent figure of duck works leaky in the United states first thought I had this sounds like we need new duck work at our home so we need newer technology duck works that probably help huh\nIt would then okay Harris he'll help\nYeah well it's going to go there too because well you know you're not going to run a business of Ninety five percent of the homes of leaky a duck work if we changed it you got you got fifty years to get your ghetto that is true All right so um so it's a good bet that every one that's listening\nThey're not getting the efficiency of that foreign as they're not getting that heated there to the places they want so what is zero seal\nThe deal is a technology that's been developed about Twenty years ago and by the department of energy acts really uh-huh yup down at uh UC Berkeley lab mhm\nUm and it when it was developed to help make the duck system more efficient at the best way to put it at the tiny hole and crack and that our our typical into an adopted them mhm and it also at the at the long term\nAnd you know almost permanent type solutions and once you do that technology\nAnd it feels that the network and guaranteed for ten years but it's been a stress test it to last up to forty years filling those cases are as long as you're going to be in your home\nRight right so it's kind of a line or\nWell kind of I I some people\nTo simplify it look at it like kind of like six a flat in a way okay bye\nAnd to be real precise about it it doesn't actually ... the ... when it does is it find the whole okay like you have a balloon pop a hole in it mhm you're gonna have air escaping out of that whole right kind of pressure right right right\nAh our technology is able to find those holes and then he'll I'm from the outside in a negative air pressure exactly that's exactly right but you know kind of stuck\nIn low on the ...\nFeels ... is that right now that okay All right so ah so I had this done to my home and I I don't know when it was but I'm going to say\nThirteen Years ago and and I notice the difference immediately so if a homeowner\nFirst of all you got to find a deal that's installing that I'm assuming that you've got air assault dot com\n... dot com and there is located are there\nAre okay so I called this company up and I say I want you to check my ...\n... and ... our system itself will check to see how leaky the doctor again than we do at before and after type comparison when they hook up the machine and they can run a test\nTo see what they charge you ... you know like a blower door test for a house\nIt's a it's kind of like what's called the duct blast protests and better than alerts OK I'm ... different dealers approach it differently and you know what they may or may not charge for that\nBut there's other ways Gary any you I can walk around my house you can walk around your house\nAnd just use your eyes to look for signs of duck linkage it's really it's really pretty easy to find right have you know I talked to my my mom and my sister about\nIt and that they were able to just walk around and find evidence that oh gosh I could have what kind of evidence they find well one of the easiest of course you mentioned that right when we began to the segment here in it and a lot of people think it's normal\nFor that that far room to be colder than the rest\nOf the how old is normal it's Ninety five percent of ... we keep [laughter] ... right\nTo make sure they have to say\nThe\nBanks of people's American\n\nAt springs so much joy into our lives they're loyal for protective and smart you are the smartest our pets might be they can't advocate for themselves especially in the event of a natural disaster Hi I'm Shaun low\nLast year during Hurricane Harvey I saw the impact of natural disaster first had many family suffered the added heartbreak being separated from the pet that's why it's important your pet is part of your family's disaster preparedness plan like storing pet food medical records and supplies waterproof containers\nAnd keep their favorite comfort toy handy this one or the\nProper identification microchip\nAt a photo of you with your pets can help in case you get separated I Can't imagine what we would do without you really\nIf you take steps now you'll encounter less stress during the chaos of an emergency\nTo learn how to prepare your pet for a natural disaster up your veterinarian and visit ban field foundation dot org slash disaster don't save it for a rainy day\nOf work are getting ... because like if I'm buying a high efficiency foreigners and I got crummy duck\nWork he he you know can he helped me at all\nHe sure can and there are still many different ways to check for evidence of how your ... you know performing how in hell healthier than the cranes ... there are simple tools and things that a lot of contractors Carrie it's called a smoke prefer okay\nYeah all it is it's exactly what it sounds like it's a little too but that will blow the smoke and find air currents\nTo for example if you put your hand up to ... you were talking about that exposed ... right right see smoke coming out on the air shouldn't be anything blowing right right you you turn on that smell pepper ... you see that it's blowing either sucking it in or pushing it out\nThat's not a good thing and that's one yeah I'm In for a red\nOr as I say that's why I asked this question so you don't have to have the big blow tests that I had no you deny you do not so they shoot an infrared camera on a wall mhm and also you got a big old red line going right through the middle you were like what's that all the\n... it's like Superman right behind the wall in the heat and cool and like you\nGot to register behind the wall and that's not helping anybody\nThat's right that's exactly right\nSo in all HVAC guys carry those for the most part\nYeah and more and more these days mhm but as a homeowner I Would ask and I would ask how are you going to help me make sure that the the ... to the Clinton and it's going to work in a way to tell you what are you doing to address my duct work because I Know how important it is a daddy Clinton it\nAnd we also know Ninety five percent of the people have leaky Duckworth that's right so so we already know you're not getting your value when you buy the new economical\nYeah what else carry the a lot of that\nA lot of the equipment manufacturers now in their consumer literature there now including warnings about the importance of it that brick right and they're saying there are things that can do if it or cause I'm Sorry cause the fish and the drain sure sure you ask about your duct work sure\nBecause they got phone calls and said hey this Ninety seven percent furnaces not lowered my eating bill one bit yet that the wire tapping yeah sure you're right\nAll right so if you are buying a furnace and it's getting installed talk about talk to you technician really about a thermal imaging some walls and make sure I don't have the leaky dj because otherwise you're not going to get the value of that I'm highly efficient furnace if you're living in an older home and you got a\nCoup spots throughout the again\nGet a hold of an H ... thermal imaging thing go to ... dot com in a you can find somebody that's a\nSkill to installing this particular thing and you say the ... around the three years yeah on average yeah that that's often so look wrap up give me some benefits of if you're perfect duck working in a nice\nNice uh efficient furnace and I have air sealing the duck\nWe're All right Gary I can do this one in my sleep you're good good I was thinking to myself that might be an unfair question right off the top down now right at kind of fun because there's really there's really no other product in our industry that can do\nAll of the things that that can do and plenty that can be one of our two of the things that when you break it down for every now\nAnd if you're a homeowner who has their own the all done on your duct work and the things are going to notice they're going to be more even temperatures throughout your house none of those hot and cold pot cool\nAnd you're also going to notice a difference and the humidity you're going to be able to better control the humidity in your home so\nYou have a dry home or a superhuman home that should be even doubt that should be a big benefit air quality now this one this is near and dear to my heart and you're going to be breathing the nasty contaminants from the ... faces in the attic or the ...\nIt's being sucked into the leaky Duckworth\nGotten right and then as the the lady of the house I might not have to die as much ... and that's that's a fun one my wife asked me to us by the way then I just want to go on record design of college I\nMean I duster well she doesn't go\nDo a lot less ... less allergens that energy saving he will not at that as well and then uh this one is also I think really important and that is it's going to ... tech and prolong the life of your ha the equipment\nAnd it's going to make sure you you get what you paid for nature

get to a rich welcome\nGarry love your show thank you\nWe have a a theater fence that we put up twelve years ago and when we put it up we stained it and now it's at the point where it needs to be a real pain ... my only question is does\nIt matter what kind of thing we originally put on a twelve years ago\nBoil versus warm now that I'm going to guess that's\nPretty [noise] pretty much a mute point at this point are probably the biggest thing you need to worry about is just ah making sure it's a really clean and that you get the pores of the would kind of opened up um that can be done fairly easily\nI'm using an oxygen native bleach and scrubbing that down rich and then use the wood bright near\nThat really opens up the wood fibers at that point no matter what you use for the use acrylic\nOr whether you use a oil base um it'll get it'll it'll penetrate the the wood deeper which means it's gonna last longer right but uh if you had an oil based on the only time you know there's always\nThere's always a disclaimer right and the only thing I could think of that would require you not to do that\nThere is some products out there in fact one time would is one of the brand names\nAs it is neither in oil base Nora water base it's actually a liquid solid in other words for it doesn't dry it cures by the UV rays of the sun\nUm in you know it's like Ninety dollars a gallon that lasts like seven years it's good stuff but if that was on that fence I Would tell you to stick with it\nUh but if it's just an oil in like a ton moral base or\nEven ... base or or water base at this point I think just getting a noxious ... would break ground there you'll be absolutely fine\nOkay great aunt one other question how do how do I convinced my grandchildren standing offenses fine\nWill that my friend is is I I don't know but I'm all about that first you gotta know how old are they\nAre they're eleven twelve in that area so they're all\nAnd K well maybe money [laughter] they ... they had to start operating like us at that point I didn't go and ... Thanksgiving you bet by by maybe a spray or\nMaybe it's a prayer would be cheaper than paying the grandkids it'd probably be a little bit better job just saying I don't know you don't know yeah you're hanging with the grandkids right yup All right good man good man All right it's aid\nA hundred and eighty two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can grab a line as we talk a little bit about home improvement remodeling repair again it's eight hundred and eighty two three eight to five five lines are open so have added Terry welcome\n[noise] hello yes\nMy ... now you talked about that one with the big hall at the bottom and then the one that didn't have the home of smaller ones some place [noise] what's your problem\nWhat's wrong with the mode\nWhere sometimes the way down and sometimes it does come K. and I checked out problem with the man asked all open and and replace at me wrong I Want to try what you had\nTo All right so um so the flush is not not working around it's not removing all the way so right usually when the waist does not thoroughly removed it's because the amount of water\nThat is coming from the closet to the bowl is not coming with enough of a a velocity there's not enough of it that's number one the other thing is\nThe the bent pipe set you check the top actually kind of come into a bowl of the toilet to takes water and air man and sometimes that little vent becomes\nUm calcified mhm and narrowed opening so you don't get an affair to make that happen so ah let's work on the vacuum first\n[noise] um and and you know so we got a fifty fifty shot hear Teri ... a bottle of C L are\nAnd that that get back here than the burden on the phone I have a bird thanks ... mix all kinds of\nNoise you hear the bird's name [laughter] hide Clyde ... played over five is Seventeen year old oh my gosh he's an old friend he's an old friend and I was like okay what are the product\nIs called C.

salesman cannot fattening and show me Iran salt water purification systems and I want to get your opinion on that system\nOkay well tell me a little bit about rain soft is that reduces hard water\nWater about his age and expect to be\nTop notch filtration I got to reverse osmosis filtration system\nThe holy trying to think OK al ultraviolet yeah wow wow I didn't know anything about it you know I'm\nVery familiar I'm very familiar with the collagen system hunter um so I have one of those in my home where it's a a you know it's a water softer and is um and then I also have a separate system which I Love by the way and that's the reverse us most is\nThe one really cool thing not that this is a necessity but I just putting granite countertops in Colombian hand in reverse us most is is rather than have to drill through the granite countertop\nOr they have a little thing it's like a hockey puck and its Bluetooth and I just touch that in my reverse us most is takes place in the water in the holding tank thing goes through the regular ...\nIs very cool but uh you know I mean you know ... I don't know how necessary that is unless you had a granite countertop and you're doing it as an after project but I'm\nI'm a carrot top and ... and they don't use ...\nFang okay that that that ... ... yeah\nSo we're supposed to ... lashes ultraviolet right um water saw or an age after ... touch it [noise] [noise]\nYeah um well well they they all for the most part the way they function at least for the water soften are part of it is a free standing tank right\nYeah and it would have to free standing tanks and it cleans itself on a timer where it comes back and flushes the residents so I guess you know I don't know with that brand well enough to offer an opinion\nBut some of the questions I Would ask is um you know how often does the resin ah or how long does the resident last\nBecause that's one of the things that has a lifespan too it um how much salt does it use and then they'll say well it depends how much water use well I got a family so I got family for\nUm they should be able to give you an estimate about how much water it uses I've had three water sophomores in my life I'm the last water softer I got was the collagen\nAnd you know I don't know how to tell you how this works but when I had to call again one installed\nIt work better than the other to the water was ... and that's how you can always tell if it's often for water feels slippery or a ... and ... is the warranty on their ... and I can't remember what it was I think it was ten years I could be wrong but\nIt was an outstanding in the\nCapital Abuja Bashir\nYeah it sounds like it's like ... it sounds like it's a great system I I don't know the system but what you're telling me it does sound like a great system so you know what the warranty is and that's awesome and they've been around in your\nCity for a while I guess you know that they've been you know been there and they have service to it and I\nNever heard of him before I got the brochure thank you for your life\nHow can I ask him about that resin and and see who the dealer is and how long they've been and all that good stuff right\nThat can have a great honor thank you Bye bye\nYeah and there are two separate systems a lot of people don't realize that there is the water softening system and then there's a reverse us most of the system so he's talking about big deal I mean that's a big deal to get both of them either water softer and then I think about four years later I put in reverse us most is\nAnd that takes out you know just about just about everything quite honestly it takes a lead in some cities you know they're they're ... water is is really good but\nYou know they they can still be bouncing around the Ninety two percent even the good ones um Ninety two percent free of lead and things like that but if you really want to really really minimizing cleaned it up that reverse us most is great kind of ... using a buying bottled water\nWhich is also a a a good idea All right uh well let's get back to another question here ... take to date might okay we'll take Mike Mike welcome\nTo good morning you're on the field doing good my\nI work down there and how long have you had to church and I'm actually a
