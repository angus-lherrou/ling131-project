Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happens with abortion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways it can be restrictions on the timing or the method or the funding that cetera\nAnd then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts um strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they um um allow them but in more cases than not they strike them down\nBased on what they understand to be\nSupreme Court precedent to those cases you know move along through the pipeline and they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do as much as they possibly can and these cases his spot them down and say we're not going to take them or whatever that lower court case decision was at the federal circuit court federal appeals court we're going to let that stand [noise]\nSo that's going to apply with one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nRight so the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but it points you can say now it seems like a good time\nAnd it's like well yeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about ...\nPercent of those and the cases it takes a rider important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where circuit courts those are the federal appeals court to the level right below the Supreme Court\nAnd they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit courts and those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue\nAnd one or two or three Supreme Court ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases coming to the court on abortion now not reflect those kinds of circuit split the court can actually say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now and these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they are directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court could simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled stands report\nJust wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court and might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year\nSimply doesn't want to do anything that might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can say we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well please\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another [laughter] let's say because it's often the case\nThat anti abortion plaintiffs uh those bringing the case I\nWant to go to the Supreme Court and say hey you know we want to ... a a twenty week limit on abortions or we want to outlaw certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw\nAbortions that are undertaken touch a particular reasons like sex or or or the disability if the fetus the court\nThe Supreme Court only gets involved and says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting because it basically has to because the lower courts are ... of course ledge because legislatures in court and don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts\nAnd that doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took a on the subject of the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know harassing\nPeople outside clinic or something like that was back in two thousand and chef and it had to do with partial birth

several major a major markets have noticed a flurry of reasons steps\nMore from USA Today business reporter Nathan booming who's been researching this make them what's going on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that Honda's our susceptible to everybody that this is a climate is\nExisted for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although some of their hunt as as well are being targeted by the two are\nRealizing that beat airbags can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases they break into the vehicle they they basically ... out of the steering wheel and then they sell it on the black market\nAnd in ... with what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blow the airbag or is this tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens is that when you need the gear bag replaced you have a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop get replaced their\nUm some people ever going to get\nA day on the side they're going to have a friend or they'll go to maybe more disreputable\nType of repair shop and that's where a lot of these types airbags ended up being sold if you actually go on E. bay for example in the search for this you will see their airbags means hold on line so it's it's definitely happening um and it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealerships something you're not going to end up accidently buying a\nUser airbag or something but there is a market for these things\nShe saw it and the reason that it's Honda's because they're popular vehicles and just happened to be more of them perhaps on in ...\nWell I definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda's of long way targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact they're popular but we don't make much sense to me is why only because in talking to the police and various markets um\nYou know almost every incentive looked at it was exclusively on this so what do you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with the actual specific Arabic conductors or something and exactly what it is\nProbably the thief themselves are the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nSo it is these are what uses a nice ... kinda strips away the covering of the center part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out I was at work\nThey somehow gain access to the vehicle and then they basically a use a knife and then they rip it out and it only takes a few minutes I to some incidents where\nYou know they hit a dozen vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night show you know it's it's definitely um\nThere's not a difficult thing to think about it this is like you know as a laptop out for the seat in the car I mean if the left towards a thousand dollars [laughter] that's about how much this\nIs worth so there's a big incentive for the season you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the Dakota one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so\nBut there's also no well we're seeing with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece in to the police the flurry of Honda airbags deaths as criminals aimed to resell on black market how do you protect yourself or is there is there a best practice here\nA few different to you you probably consider here number one is we see in a vehicle near St late or near a parking lot late that can help because these aren't going to choose a vehicle that's way under the late that could make them easy to spot\nSecondly I hadn't thought of this you can try not to park near a big vehicles that are maybe a structure\nOf the the view so when the the kind of hide behind the big SUV or big truck that's one thing to consider it unless they in some

its current political divides Wall Street journal executive\nWashington editor Jerry ... says it's a storyline that carries echoes of the twenty sixteen presidential election in one that could bring the same kind of bitter aftermath Jerry how do you see it\nWell I think we're going to end up with divisions again you know because the way to mid term is shaping up and and by the way you know they're still three weeks ago and that's an eternity in American politics today so [laughter]\nPredictions are very dangerous spot if you were to take a snapshot today you say it looks as if the picture's improving somewhat for Republicans\nBut Democrats probably still have the or in a good position to take back control of the house because a lot of those house races are playing out the swing races are playing out in suburban\nDistricts where they're Democrats are stronger and where's the college educated suburban women I become a very strong democratic constituency so they seem to be a good position to take back control of the house but at the same time\nRepublicans look as if they're in better shape to keep control the Senate\nOr in some measure because the Republican base was very unhappy with the way Brett Kavanaugh was treated as a Supreme Court nominee and that has kind of energized the Republican base and reminded them that they like having Republicans pick and confirmed judges and so\nAh the balance in the Senate will be determined in a bunch of red states where there's a lot of pro Trump support and so\nYou're going to have it you could very well end up with a picture of a divided Congress and Democrats thinking that they uh have won a a a national\nVote in an ass it's the same way they did when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote twenty sixteen but don't have a very big hold on political power if they simply have one half of Congress and so\nThat's a that's a recipe that is probably going to produce um obviously divided government has a hard time getting things done and it's a continuing democratic anger at their opposition within the political system\nStarts so there's no ... for example uh [noise] I'm no lessening of the divide because the Democrats let's say when the house and Republicans maintain control the Senate because there's more balance I mean\nWell ... you know that's possible and in order a couple of issues interestingly trade maybe one they're actually may be some common ground you know there are a lot of Democrats who are\nCloser to President Trump on trade and his use of tariffs and um basically challenging allies on trade issues there are some Republicans are Republicans have tended to be more free traders [laughter] so you may actually have a slightly bigger\nBalance of support for the president I'll trade in a divided Congress but on most issues and particularly on health care it's going to be very hard to get something done 'em and I think you're going to have\nA and if he if Democrats do in fact take back control of the house there's going to be inevitably pressure from the Democratic base to begin investigations of various um activities in Trump world including potentially\nA reef revisiting the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh but also having a look at some financial dealings with the president and the aftermath of a mall or in investigation and so you definitely going to have a more confrontational atmosphere in Congress or if there is democratic control of one house\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ...\nHe's written a piece about how the election is unlikely to end the political divide that we're seeing you're up to that a\n... and I want to ask the forty incumbent House Republicans who are vacating their seats with this feeling about a democratic wave be different if the ... the majority of those forty we're sticking around\nI think it would be I mean I think it's a big deal a you know some of it it's actually more than forty depending on how you count so it's a big number and you know some some of those are the Republican incumbents were going to be in trouble in this environment anyway so they you know got out while the getting was good\nSome of them probably could have better defended their seats than a newcomer can answer that opens the door all the wider for Democrats is actually I think one of the unappreciated factors in in this campaign is the amount of open space Republican\nRetirements left for Democrats to move in and one of the interesting things that's happened in one of the reasons Democrats feel good about house races is that these democratic challengers in swing districts where there's an open seat or Republican U.S left", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city":

worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people say that the reason they're holding back as soon as the you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nNow we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending about my generation what's that break down\nYeah you know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and the inclination to save more as the reason for rolling back\nSkew younger so millennials in particular lead the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend ... also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on my spending Gen x is not far behind um but it's so similar trend there\nMost inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to say more money\nBut that's changing ... baby boomers those are the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back\nOn their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter] but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth and the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers it better in the workforce\nStagnant income is still very much an issue\nThat much of this is a recession hang over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say\nOh what a generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking this up on their own\nSo certainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this in a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about in the past ... millennials have a greater inclination\nTowards saving a they have a little less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from preceding generations and I think a lot of it stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand in the case of older millennials or\nSeen the impact that it had on family members friends older siblings are just as you were sort of in those financially formative years has undoubtedly had in the fact that we see that manifesting itself in a number of different ways you know in this case it's that that focus on saving limiting the spending in order to save more money\nLike Greg Greg McBride chief financial analyst at ... dot com twenty minutes in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning

veterans running on the on the Democratic side\nOr the vets a seemingly willing to do this\nSo this has been a who's been sort of a two fold every one is um folks in the Democratic party of said that veterans have been a habit of coaching at parties say where we're interested in running a and the same time the Democratic party has a has a number of different things that it's putting into place\nTo to welcome back in the party so for instance there's a couple a couple of first term a first term Democrat in the house of representatives to put together fundraising apparatus take a leadership role in the party and uh have have really come out to support so veterans who are coming up behind them and the system\nIs that right is that number correct that there is a hundred and Ninety nine veterans

the the summer there are some of the parts and right now that's that's a strategy that that some folks are using if they're if they aren't veterans themselves and they're running against that turns to say hey look yeah well you know like\nWe we appreciate we appreciate the service but you know there's there's other occasion but there are more important\nAnd in this very partisan environment a rise
