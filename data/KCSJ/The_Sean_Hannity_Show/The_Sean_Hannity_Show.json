I Would I ran into um\nWhat's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Kavanaugh hearings said he was a total jackass during those hearings is coming out of where I was going in and I said center Sean Hannity how are you\nWe had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with um I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out of the ... ballot box\nI have I have a fear and when I say feel with um regarding myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself what I had always said you know it's just an old man of the ... that's why I say I have a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the old me will come out and they asked me if I'm with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response would go by what but I think they pick and choose their targets doesn't exactly\nWell maybe but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half\nMaybe they aren't the largest and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to top\nCrazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk away\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past just caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the last that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pastor what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of and Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor it in I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated you know some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am ... so do you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you\nSay that I have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama said we're never coming back\nWell the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say

has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come racing towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what you know you can have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us into were horrible people uh especially when the

Scott and that's for governor and Rhonda said this is a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle of people showing up in the panhandle you got a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back\nTowards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it's ... if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against the British and we have Britain's team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall hold but people have got to get out the vote 'em we see

Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly\nWe've got a hold the seat Heller seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada

president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide ear\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the

amazing the criticism that has been out there for what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walked right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security and made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's\nSpent a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any end it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nIn Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping a finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column ... my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question let on the mark I mean there's actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president's ... who basically tried to overthrow the constitution and making ... for life there and done with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos pictures from the more so again no great great mystery this is\nThe work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border\nWall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ... says mommy seem to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws come in according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered by the way those books that are actively don't want to control the border\nWhy is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get it just added stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm I'm married I was I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he says and people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here are coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number\nPeople rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\n... ugly or something we don't want to be hurt and also it was undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff on the probably been like you know I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to\nShow they are being put in the ... in the middle of this I'm simply we as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible raunchy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I taking the time I think more than any other person immediate in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence and\nOn the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding what looked like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is being looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nThere without question of what you just describe age most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the border\nDisney Trump so I think that just they just want to silence and they're going to just ...\nI I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats\nOh boy if the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada I think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana\nAnd we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nLarry Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirements\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBecause Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nMaxine Waters is a committee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a

case of Hitler and wanting the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that the two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand tend to mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nThe crumbs back increase to regulate watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a

S. dot com and\nI'm [noise]\n\nLooking back at it as a ... show so nice to have you with us this afternoon and are the saving depending on where you are around the country\n\nThe politics of the political caravan Democrats clearly want to use this caravan of illegal immigrants coming to the U.S now and almost ten thousand stronger\nGet here close as they possibly can to election day have America or have to stand up for itself and then they'll use it against the president saying this is the Republican Party this is how inhumane they are they're going to support the children they are going to support the mothers they're going to exploit anybody they possibly can export\nThey're going to do what ever they can to support them so they can use their hardships for their own political reasons\nLet's go to your phone calls on this see what you think about it one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to uh let me go to George thinks are wedding you're on the bench Ferguson show go ahead\n[noise] yes first thing I like to say is that President Trump is doing the right thing\nI Am the place and that came over in the Nineteen fifties from New York and they should stop all of this immigration nonsense and go back to the a plan they had in the fifties you had to have a sponsor first of all\nAnd that sponsor usually gave you a job for you to when they will be on your own in the country and get another job this thing is\nIf something when Wallace you sponsor responsible for you in other words that was no such thing is going on welfare and that's one of the big problems here\nAnd what happens is if the sponsor didn't want to do anything you went back to the ... you came from and that's the way it should be\nSee I I agree with you because it used to be accountability there now it's well I don't want to have to deal with any of the accountability the government or the the Democratic Party has in essence become the sponsor\nThat's correct and and and so they say there is no there is no one to show you the ropes there's no one to get you connect to the community there is no one there to hold you accountable to work to your tail off\nThere's no one there for any of that because now it's just getting this country will give you a free health care will give your kids free schooling we'll give you everything you want for free\nYeah it's all political and it just basically getting bogus could've done with that that's the only thing they have left everything else\nIs a failure you look at any city the Democrats have a tip your sticks to eat it and you can follow that city bankruptcy\nPeople are moving out of those places and into places that have a better tax rules I mean this is a big big problem and if you used to avoid any regime that is correct word to use here\nOkay because they were in the past ... you know this goes back to Alaska gene uh they were advertising\nFull page ads in Hong cities to South America and they make cities and basically telling all the ... things that the United states had cause them to get it in the\nShallow any taxpayer out that she is this what they do they get the whole thing should be on the tax payers broaden that had jobs here and the distribution ... distribution of Monday she'll be up to the governments\nWho was who was your sponsor when you when you came through I mean it was in a family friend out of that work\nThis was the Catholic Church\nAnd they ended they do more than just sponsored a mentor you did they get you connect in the community what all did they do\nYeah they uh they did that and they provided a depression job and you had to work there for about a year to two years and then if you had something better going ah you know job why are you going to get that job\nIt was it's a simple system but it's the you know it's up to you you don't want to crush peoples and ... and that's when they come here and the only ambition that most of those people have is to go on welfare that's the only Sumpter yeah at me as a human being\nAnd as you just put it don't go on welfare don't have a backup plan amen to that great point and I appreciate the phone call will continue this conversation right now on Facebook and on Twitter ... Ferguson show on Twitter you can follow me there and Twitter and hit\nLike button on Facebook will continue the conversation there right now in the meantime have a fabulous week\nTo make sure you can follow us on Twitter Ben Ferguson show altogether on Facebook as well\nBen Ferguson show hit the like button\nHave a fabulous week [noise]\nSo we're twenty first day on the breed or radioactive high check out our talk radio resist the Rio de brand new episode with the legendary Paul McCartney\nNo arming treat to molded film with Joel leaving to talking about his new album Egypt Station in of course some discussion about a little band called the Beatles we were ... when we were playing music or radio presented Rubio check it I'll know\nWhy Tracy Esther was low\nFive Ninety Jaycee a street are gone and on your own with our high orange radio I never sang\nHe's talked to scientists don't long so overwhelming I really hope she doesn't really know what I'm saying\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying that indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria a bird to Romo that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThere was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton the paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we are finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's is with us\nFormer congressman now on Fox News contributor author of the New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nThey seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or maybe I can issue a subpoena but the only way to force that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also militarized themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ...\nHe was canceled for the DNC he was counsel for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... a productive group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they could just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up\nAnd do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former friends and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress to take this it and I don't care if they're not going to\nUm ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it\nYou've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene in usa peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it there is that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the Pfizer warrants the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nAh Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael with us Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom\nBetween the Congress has an important issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a two to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information\nWas fat conversations George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and then the court intercepting those compensation they found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information to the by the court\nKnow it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said this\nSame thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump\nCollusion but they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relief of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath\nBut I still had to

Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are\nThe candidates said and then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those who are told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nSo I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia that's going to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp telling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia\nAnd said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in a gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Chris than a cinema now she's going up against Martha ... Sally one of the important races that were following\nAnd how she uh had referred to her own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy and the meth capital of the world and all the Washington Examiner apparently found emails that show cinema herself inviting a prominent group\nI'm not making this up of I'm reading from the Washington Examiner of feminist which is\nNow how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of the there's the side that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them were on a razors edge with the Iranians with their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I think Trump get one more thing I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly\nTried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were supposed to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah yeah that's the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just set it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they like the president on that you know the president came up to the king and ... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale\nAnd something that we don't know about it looks like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nAnd well okay you're going to happen I mean the the men and women I chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting in driving et cetera and being told how to dress or being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera I'm ...

I think you were sort of looks like a high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major us the central feeding people dress up differently but it's such a

not I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you the answer which is a when I was an organizer you know before you and I met I was a community organizer I used to organize protests like you know going to people's workplaces or you know not just the halls of Congress right because that's\nWhere the people's business is supposedly done what we're talking people's lawns cetera\nUm you know look I support in a free speech absolutist I support free speech on all sides so am I and the and then these protests those sorts of protests now make me uncomfortable and look I did speak out against\nA you know going up to you know and it's costing people in restaurants or you know what happened to Sarah Huckabee Sanders et cetera\nI Do think you are\nI I Love you say you're dancing 'cause you're kind of ignoring you know I I don't know what I'd like to punch I'd like to punch him in the face or not the crap out of them or you know maybe they should have been rough up or you know that that if we talk about\nViolent rhetoric and we're gonna look I think it's all bad but like ... rhetoric\nIs now the tactic I the the heart\nOf the hard left you know people don't like when when the president says you know fake news and they're not real news people and their phony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech and my hearing you write you used to organize protests in front of people's houses\nYou didn't hear me correct yes\nWhy would you do that knowing that there could be kids women and children in the house because I kind of a rule leave the women and children alone\nWell I I I haven't\nMet maybe maybe it'll today that I don't know maybe it'll be accused of being\nSome of those policymakers might be women so leave the husbands children alone to where the partners whatever again I'm not saying it a as a some kind of bragging rights I'm saying it because my position on that has changed\nBut we'll hire hearing now regularly issued these sound to me like marching orders creator crowd push back followed them into gas stations department stores restaurants you see a cabinet member you go at him getting their face\nI'm not hearing the Republican side and my point to you is this look I I think it's very hard to try I I ... I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line and um I got to be\nHonest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all but I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now ... get to walk the halls\nWithout what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations zone in that are\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and find a way all within the last ... to\nDo it but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is his rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled by play it for you right now\nI always said about Obama the number one leaves kids alone that both he and Michelle

about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren\nHas claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania all teach you got all the law school\nShe was described as quote the only in your minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her ...\nThey are and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against\nAs a result of all this then tries to prove to her detractors\nThat she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but\nYou know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld than Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nIn showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm and you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the un Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist friends at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House in ... when you're twenty\nI'm In no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever on\nIs a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nTake your kids to cover today\nGo to ensure kids now dot Gov or call one eight seven seven kids now [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nGo go\nReally shutting down a woman or online services something called ... plus [noise]\nAfter they found a software glitch that exposed private profile data of nearly half a million users to outside for developers this all happened last week Google\n\nThey ...

C. S. J. lo and I are radios\nAt ... dot com on your own with our high orange radio ads\nIn numbers how many ... that appears to be part of the strategy for a caravan of migrants that started in Central America now an estimated seven thousand heading for the U.S border where they're willing to take their chances spite us efforts to stem the flow\nAnd then you've got a case an allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements in his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nApparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I\nThey should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you that\nIf you want to predict and it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida he'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida as important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe it's not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with uh we've got infinite whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know run the center of the great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nGillum is we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBeing honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett us it and the project ... tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but you know for whatever reason bread I said is out there trying to convince the people tend to see that it's something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and\nSaying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill you know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets hoops to Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been\nCut the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the week in front of some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening LA Weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep you keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or hired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled\nAmericans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have ... I didn't get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber\nIt's a far cry from last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... alley is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations of new Fox\nA poll has come out of Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about the diction submitted fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom for as it was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nToday that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi\nWas her eyes on the speakers gap said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black um ... Marshall mixed Martha McSally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and a high camp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly a problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian race\nAnd that means that the libertarian is siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong\nWell Mike Braun is now claiming that\nYou know a Brett Kavanaugh served citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this was an opportunity one bit of anecdotal as we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats as at an all time high but you know I'm Crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on friday and an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people a hundred and thirty\nThe president of turkey says he's going into detail tomorrow in his speech before parliament about the details surrounding the death of Saudi journalist ...

footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know by a chain link fence said the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross into Mexico\nNow this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen and we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan ... make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally it is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty\nThey're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies that allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there well you know it just I mean it's basically a national emergency\nIf you look at it you have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks imbedded with the migrant

it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly\nUm so you've got the care of and continuing their march\nNow a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nHelicopter horseback boats all terrain vehicles you foot I've been out there I've seen even gang

National Guard in order to make sure\nThat we saw what happened last friday in Mexico but their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now a ... it's almost like we're headed towards a major\nHuman confrontation here people that don't affect our laws in sovereignty and the president saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty um no I I think Democrats are like ... in the back of their heads hoping this happens so oh maybe something bad will happen in Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you you never know I Hope I Hope not I pray not yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady comment is that a Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said I'm In I'm sick of this kind of stuff she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted a toy store her goals and dreams in this great nation\nThat's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happened and the and the possible political implications\nAnd motivations behind these things that's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come this to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming asylum aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to confront either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nOr we saw Mitch McConnell go through this at the airport and then this weekend and happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now hearing Kissinger was shouted down listen to some of this [laughter]\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nI got a Ninety two year old man who served as countries you know it's unbelievable you know what the ... you know ... or what's the name Maxine Waters you you create a crowd you confront them you do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell Leo country\nYou know then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is as wrong as it gets this is not how not on a decent people are supposed to behave and and it is you know with the part that bothers me the most Sean is did is to send it is a good friend of mine and he is as far left as I Am\nNow is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the ideas he'll show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he would never this is the new left\nThis isn't new to this is the way liberal and and and people who believe in their positions and their ideas and their their policy that's the way it's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and so so wrong and just\nNot going to let me ask you this and this great nation off or\nHow does the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is is going to pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing it has this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to anyone to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know we're getting we're we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that mixed in with the crowd to want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\n... if they're hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safest for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't want to see people the president does want to see that\nBut on the other hand I Can't you can't allow them to come in either\nI write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced the Democrats once a quarter because I think deep down they want the politics of this issue they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the border we need more ability to when people get there to hold them not this catch and release policy hold them\nHow they're have their case that due to cater to we can find out or they legitimate or they're really fleeing something or or are they coming here to do harm are they part of the same game what's their background each it takes some time to do that but and it takes resources it takes\nPresident Trump tweeted the Democrats are to blame for the care of and for the lax immigration laws he's vowed to stop them from entering the wives and a massive search is still underway for the Wisconsin missing teen who disappeared after her parents were found dead in their home there in

living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans that won the presidency you know those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ...\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so ... what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter insect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors Asian the caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that did very well credential judge\nOh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll tell you the CBs carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blamed the Democrats\nWere not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary built Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your border because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response so\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... what could the rancher possibly\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ... percent of the society shutting the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last ... Eighteen months that is a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons was either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get it and he called them the blue collar billionaire and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put it in President he was at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better when in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspirations\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is it you cannot just ties\nOr through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nKnow the real danger so I don't know how this was all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a ...\nBut figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives it's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is\nOr living

thought in the past to ask for these things and the fact that he not only does it then wins then the American workers all across the country doing better and that that's what brings us to this

was able to\nPressure on China from Europe he's affective Lee and people are really reporting is pretty joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues and these trade agreements with China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show hopefully owned by me back I think he gets a trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe ... let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took a thirty five percent dive\nSo that would tell me right now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're banging on his door begging that they can get those back\nOf course yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and uh we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs you're\nJust to break even shot and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled or it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it done shortly thereafter\nOr because we both know the president's personality he's hitting very very core of but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government are and what is best for the American working family so\nAh and that's why he's doing so well ... and by the way you know back its

senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri or their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like a Washington Post he's pleading at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about some of these position I said what about other things she came here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we Maxine Waters on\nTape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five then we see\nThe center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's eh thing beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appealed to moderate through the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri are kind of see you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when the Democratic party a band in\nAny sense of due process under the law equal application under our

most disgusting thing to me it's the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it isn't backfiring on her and I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to do is come out and apologized to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not proud of and I'm not going to run\n\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your

by the way twenty five now told the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren well she does have to get re elected a senator if she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is Native American\nWe can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage she was featured in a Native American cookbook that isn't titled\nHow wild chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American in a professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but\nYou know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nA show and great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm stuck around one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when it's not tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republicans for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist printed that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about the safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House",

you try heroin does much better high and the only ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually gonna be main lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the

and and and restaurants and you tell them we don't want to know where ... ... ... now where any point any time I mean is that the New America because I didn't I don't remember that um [noise]\nWell that's certainly the America will desperate left because they're losing or the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new lipstick violence a which in the end I think\nTurns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because this is Steve ... proved when he was shot um you know if you're conservative when you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watched the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes\nAbout running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of the conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it\nWasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract and I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I it everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not they're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is the fourth a cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing of America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and is often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments are and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater or fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and his ... and I think that just further isolate some\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna\nTeach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done um they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and it's partly because\nIf they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned this on your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind our cabin all and Carol van I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination the childish behavior by US Senators incentive meetings\nI think all that came together to really really galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan\nComing up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks because it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody\nWho can get finance and remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala actually four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just as it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams or who are clearly favors

left and they send cameras following him for ten minutes\nThough I ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then then you have to ruptured and said that was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name\nUm but then he got on and he went on this had been a tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the

only twelve days until the important mid term elections\nYou know it had been and even I and phone into this even though I tell you don't fall into this I had been reading the polls and I kept seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for Kavanaugh which was a good bowl with the right thing to do um but with that and I'm now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir a congratulations this seems to be a very big comeback\nI'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell ... thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter flop advance the Trump jobs agenda\nAnd matches or dishonest Washington liberal more and more people drill down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very do it and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worries during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business\nYou know it's one of our our best resources that we have clean coal and we have you know people brave enough to go in the mines I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's about energy in the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened and Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years during the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the offer ... took the lead nationally to go against you know I'm a power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal\nOn the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are basically your health services rage that President Trump's\nReally strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate that so that's one of the president's comments were strongly behind me she knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today are meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nAnd I have a compassionate solution\nTo ensure the safety of Democrats the best thing you can do is to simply vote them out of office so they won't be in a position that anger is so many people and remove them from daily public political circumstance in threat once again I condemn all bombs in politics today well known Democrats or the ...\nWe must protect them vote them out of office for their own good and their own safety that

glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you\nA good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and uh uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of take the lead now but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal or replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf if we in two weeks to have a ... a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold onto the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have by the way preexisting conditions the big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about\nBeen able to get Dr Josh ... outlets Seventy in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals or even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks or treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge care you ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals\nAnd if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been a vacation\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nBut we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in Nevada\nUh we definitely need more than ... Sally war hero against this radical Christ in ... now no problems with Americans joining\nGee how to use and and joining the Taliban then of course we've got Montana tests or has a lead at this point but that's still in play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits\nA and Joe Donnelly his case he should be removed\nAnd we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their
