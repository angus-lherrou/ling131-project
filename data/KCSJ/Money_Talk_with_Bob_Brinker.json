reports heat up for you she's wide receivers demi ... to play through a hamstring injury that according to NFL networks Ian Rapaport\nThree catches twenty six yards total in or even weeks Eighteen catches two hundred and forty four yards and encouraged out when they were taught him this week it's an odd week about let's leave him on the sidelines showing McCoy just because people are still foolish enough to think\nHe's a starter he's got the ... is a terrible zero touchdown he just the top forty rushing yards\nIn a game you know better than a\nDesperation likes play at this point you can find another option given some of these high powered off and I'll take my shot what the second back in those games with the heavy over\nJust says you scratching your head what happened two weeks ago against the Vikings [noise]\nBecause last week than the bills are skunks by the Packers and everything gets back to normal and you're just what what the heck happened we\nThree not not only on the bills on line but on the Viking sideline\nBiking go ahead lay range lands and I know that but you know with the Packers I like the fact that there were all salty that they love points on the board of course they also left every wide receiver in home\nFor all the injuries they have but we'll get into that over the course of the day was let's talk about Aaron Rodgers not that you're going to city um altogether but he's back in number one way going against Detroit even if everybody was healthy he'd still be an interesting story this week looking at a Detroit\nTeams given up just fourteen fantasy points per game two opposing quarterbacks event in the national football league all the banged up wide receivers ... still out when the lions are but they'll have developed a Adam's then we'll have Jimmy ... and they will have a bevy\nOf nice young targets including a Valdez gambling used on the radar\nAs he the way in your daily fantasy leagues in a wing a wing of prayer kind of option Korea we gotta keep going Carlos Hyde against Baltimore Baltimore given um eighty eight total rushing yards and her gamble they want\nLock steady as they go top Fifteen wide receivers have gigs a couple of slots higher here going up against Philly given up nearly ... thirty fantasy points per game do opposing wide receivers if most and the national football league already six touchdowns allowed\nA for the eagles I've I've got to look at Carson winds and even though it's been on even less far he's got all shown Jeffrey back he got Nelson Aguilar\nAnd you look at that Minnesota deep and it's I don't know what kind of speech anybody's given right there's talk at a at a coordinator went over and he talked to the\nThat's going to solve anything he can't play [laughter] you can't pick up the Anthony barring coverage there\nAre still going to be some problems in the back seven your point about Jeffrey and Aguilar being available for the eagles and Jeffrey of course things up early on in the season the eagles or the U.S percentage of wide receiver targets in the NFL of any team they're throwing to the tide ends the throwing throwing running backs more than anybody else\nIn the NFL maybe this is the week to turn that around if you're the Philadelphia Eagles\nGet a little bit of a quick release planes and teams that are trying to get at you aggressively obviously the early issues for next falls and then when you look at cars and why don't you want to see how mobile is right so you're going to bring the house\nSo this week you know you're you're going against a team that hasn't had a pass rush right he ever driven situation or we hope he's got the help that he needs and can get his way back onto the field but his absence\nTakes away one of their big past Russia opportunists and they've had zero and after coming to an opposing quarterbacks or the first quarter of the season\nAs you said it's a field goal difference in this game you play them on a neutral field to be a a pick 'em if you will between the\nEagles and Vikings I just don't think you see the same things play out and I know that there are different faces different players but even though this is really the what a span of five games that\nThese these teams have played since the last play the meaningful game against each other and we had a few championship I don't think it plays out like that game did in January\nWorlds apart and that his personality changed over so much the number of injuries and when we\nWere talking about an inch season right where you have a stretch of a couple of games that come back and physically and we see it in college certainly right\nThe after effects of running into an Alabama or one of those teams that two to three weeks later you're realizing how many injuries uses yeah it's it's the same thing here that the cumulative effect of running deep into the playoffs and even winning a Super Bowl there there's ramifications that following you into the next year\nIs my comment I'm Dan ... is a Fox football fantasy you can always reach us on Twitter I'm at the end by or on Fox Mike they can get you and me over and swollen dome will and we still have you on beatings after week five in the national football league we answer that question after Brian\nFamily gives us the latest of what's happening in the world of sports come on and Brian good voting guys thank you so much for having me\nI'm a ... day thank you so much just an absolute honor to be here what's ah what's happening in college football major league baseball and of course\nThe national football league the national football league will injury news as we approach that one PM eastern kickoff Vikings running back Donovan Cook is not expected to play because of a hamstring injury\nBagels running about Joe mix and has been activated however his teammates Giovanni Bernard is a no go she's wide receiver semi Watkins open to play through a hamstring injury Gordy Dennis network Sienna Rapaport and as you had guys had mentioned Texans running back Lamar Miller\nA game time decision in college football late last night Utah studying number four team Stanford there were three upsets that's often\nTexas over number seven Oklahoma Florida\nTaking down fifth rank to LSU and Mississippi State beating number eight Albert and to and all the playoff games today Rockies brewers for thirty seven eastern time on him and all the network Milwaukee you have to own that series and the Dodgers embrace country into seven eastern on Fox Sports one LA ahead few games to none\nAnd the guys back to I'm Brian Finley thanks Bryan we appreciate it of\nCourse the brewers and vouchers can go for sweeps today Yankees Red Sox even up at a game of piece of that divisional series are interesting to say the least than the America because the Yankees got one last night in Boston off of yep you guys that\nDavid Price nice effort David Price a buddy his confidence not shaken see I Love that people keep trying to push the narrative that it's not enough of a sample size I don't know\nClearly there's some problem right one once we start getting into the number of starts things had against this team and the number of playoff starts then he said\nThat there's something there oh yeah it's it's it's not like you said one every three year or some small sample size and I know statistically speaking for all you people going back to your school days and what constitutes a a a proper sample size for a survey or anything else I think we had for David Price at this point\nIt's the thing and it was talked about this summer in New York in June ... say thing and Yankees know what in the last night they proved that\nEven up that series at a game apiece this is Fox football fantasy he's my comment I'm Dan by our company laugh at the guy feel Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go go to guy could I comic all eight hundred dollars for seven auto the hard part figuring out which way is easier\nI just Mike I'm just saying this because I just have a sense and know it's easy to take recent history and go back and say okay this is happening this is what I've seen over the last four weeks\nI Know that the rams have been dominant in the national football league and I know that the sea hawks\nAren't what the Seahawks once were but to have a team be more than a touchdown favorite on the road in Seattle gets my ears perked up I think the rams actually today was more of a ... a more difficult time with the sea hawks and people would want to imagine\nBut I'll tell you what so far the ramps have really had no difficulty whatsoever Sam the first thirty minutes against the raiders were served as their preseason rice team has been rolling ever since\nNo that's just and it was their preseason effort to get things started we look at Seattle how much the loss of Earl Thomas planes in writing the flame magnificent football uh before flipping the bird to the sideline and\nBeing carted off surgeries successful and and everything we know we get those reports earlier today on terms of the rod insertion and everything and gruesome details but a huge should\nWith rehab probably be able to get back on to an NFL field but his last now becomes a question of what does that do or that the Seahawks defensive you got to pick your poison right you got three guys oh and that Todd girlie character to contend with I'm with you know when you're looking at seven or seven and a half wherever you came in on the line\nUh it seems pretty lofty Seattle for all of its\nIssues and all of the the scuttlebutt and consternation and all the stories we've had in the media\nThe defensively they played pretty well and from fantasy purpose in ... bears out there looking at six best the best against quarterbacks eleventh best against running backs and so obviously the wide receiver and tied in position fall in line there and so the opportunity here\nOn a road game that\nAlways looking from where's where's the potential for a let down yeah and and where an opponent has with a little bit of an early push decided advantage you look at Seattle primed for potentially the upset spot here or at least to make things difficult for Jared often go\nIt will be interesting to see of Seattle can give some resistance to that ... would you said is with with the three headed monster of of woods cup and cooks and then you throw in a really and it's really those poor guys it's something that that we've talked about on the show\nYou're not going to hear a lot of Jared ... office thrown into a different guy knowing that you know that's that's not going to happen it's going to be one of those four likely doing the damage for the rams head of the ... can run the ball in what is the second home game of the season\nThey they control the clock against the cowboys in their first home game of the year use Chris cars that a lot in that game he didn't play week for comes back we'll play this week\nExpect Seattle to really try to run turn the clock and get that run again going to get to the ramp\nWell and that's the big question years you've got a guy like Mike Davis\nA twenty five touches over a hundred and twenty yards and to scores\nFrom out of ... and now you had Carson back so potentially with that it it should settle in for the rest of the Wilson not that he's an offensive juggernaut and right now twentieth among quarterbacks for fantasy purposes and a guy that you're probably sitting down\nToday waiting to see how it plays out a lot kitten and Marshall and whatever you have going you're not going to play them on this one right I think they might be able to ... up a little man with the with that attitude and and with that game plan that you you you propose and now it's\nIt's imperative that someone's got to show resistance to this all up and at some point right ... it's not going to run roughshod over the lead to this level but as soon as you got a Cooper cup ...\nTrailing in with a linebacker trailing yeah as they add I mean that that's the beauty of the off and tried as you're always finding right which guy gets matched up with the slow linebacker that now has to try to keep up across scraping across the middle there's nobody that's going to be able to do it\nSo that was the C I still have to figure out the day the jaguars in chief and the other matchups featuring the other on beating than the national football league they are Kansas City they are home they are likely going to have semi Watkins today a despite the questionable tag but here comes the chiefs on the shore week but at least they're at home taking on Jacksonville today\nOr if you want to go down that route you've got Ryan grants or one of those you know one of those secondary receivers Chester\nA just a Rogers even though you had a couple of\nCrucial miserable yeah in that game or you know because Andrew Luck doesn't throw at the on twenty yards too often twice you tried to do it to Rogers and bounced off his chest one in the end zone one that would have been a huge pass completion\nBut you know the targets are certainly there uh for for him obviously that doesn't help you for today's games as he's already way but\nA lot of those two I'll give Anderson a slight uptick\nYet or if it's not today it's never how 'bout that that's ... that's about time I waver wire otherwise he is my comment I'm Dan by one mystery man clue already review he's a six year veteran in the national football league and since she's been of the leak there only been to other players from his college to enter the NFL\nWhat is clue number two for our\nNumber two for mystery man he has caught successfully eighty six percent of his targets\n... well that's pretty good that's not too bad [noise]\nMystery man who number two year old Fox football fantasy it's someone you've got to get in your light up we're just given clues to who that person may be\nSpeaking of clues are I think the saints are running game is going to be improving over the next couple of weeks like it even needs anymore improvement as one mark Ingram is\nBack [noise] he has returned\nMarching from NIH back from his four game suspension [noise]\nBlame for the same [noise] some moron I against the Washington Redskins return on the\nRetired off the back [noise] marking per se backed by the same [noise] how much karaoke to just take in Vegas as we\nHeard there was it a lot there well actually there there is there was that there wasn't any oh we went to the the uh the swaying again or if you will as it swings for mark Morris in our own line everybody\nNobody's thing because of their own voice now you can\nReturn to the back marking goes back for the saints up this week of course they have ... we talked about taking on the red skins on Monday nights middle\nNumber ... running back this week for Ingram obviously upside potential in terms of the red zone opportunities that may avail themselves when you look at Washington overall on defensively they've been pretty doubt uh opportunities are only a hundred and\nTen yards a pregame are rushing yards allowed plus one touched down that's for the season two opposing running back to the debt to hell of a job a dust bar but for the St Drew Brees you expect him to get his record and everybody will do the the wave and the pomp and circumstance and now it's a question of beyond Michael Thomas\nWas catching the wouldn't home for him right it's been a lot of come era yeah and they'll say that you had given pops up on the radar and disappears as quickly as he did get married at that is one touchdown reception\nAnd then he disappeared so I think it Drew Brees Thomas ... little bit deeper you're getting run but otherwise those secondary receivers and even Benjamin Watson are guys that are falling to the wayside\nAgainst going to miss the game because if a bum nice change heavy by in weeks six falcons dealers we've touched on here and there are just especially big band in James Connor and Antonio Brown in ... and Vance ... Donald in Calvin Ridley and we'll Jones in\nMatt Ryan in am I Am I going wrong any ... Freeman is back we could have done to return to the back as there are the three men human seven Coleman the backfield\nOr just a lot of guys to play in Pittsburgh yeah both number choose a when you look at Coleman and Freeman coming back or probably more a wax option for you there\nAnd that I give us a little bit of love I Will get Austin Cooper in All right on the way as a a deeper tight and like\nHey you know what box football fans he brought you buy discover become a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more I discovered dot com slash match limitations apply\nAaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers don't have many weapons heading to Motown\nHow will that fair for the green and gold will tell you the next year and Fox buffet\nOkay Ben matter here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me you're just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great rates and great service rover Seventy five years\nAnd any time you need help you can speak to one of their train specialist twenty four seven the company is guy go go to guy go dot com today\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\n... helped me find them back home pros in my area the handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the problem check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that Holleman minds are is completely greedy you go to ... dot com or download the ... to get started and\nWe just we're delivering the sports and entertainment you may yeah yeah they get the job and it knocks you out\nYou lie manning has been better the last three weeks he struggled week one but he has been better the last three weeks how ms completion percentage is much better the numbers if you just look at him he's been much better\nIn the last three weeks but clearly [noise] there's not a threat to go ...\nAnd in today's NFL when you're watching the LA ran when you're watching the Minnesota Vikings when you're watching the Kansas City chiefs when you're watching a Tom Brady throwing the double coverage in the end zone Josh Gordon maybe college kind of changing a little\nYou know what I mean like when Mitch tribute skiing had sticks touchdown passes\nThat when you take a step back and go what are we watching again or what's going on here this doesn't really uh I'm I'm ... I'm confused or that one one minute yeah he he can't throw those like the next minute he's throwing six touchdowns I'm a little confused here so\nThe league is changing it's an aerial attack down field it seemed like in every single game and you got you I mainly who can't get to the fall down feeling [noise]\nAnd I'm not saying that to take a shot at him [noise]\nBut it's the truth [laughter] he line manning was the longest pass completion on the season is thirty seven yards [noise]\nThat put him thirty six in the NFL behind every starting quarterback [noise] a couple of backup quarterback\nAlbert Wilson a wide receiver from the dolphins and Kevin ... fired a safety from the tight [laughter] all those players have a completion longer than Eli Manning the season [noise] that's a fact\nYou can podcast all of our shows like searching Fox Sports radio when you're twenty four seven sports and entertainment network\nWe are box sports radio ladies and gentlemen\nFind how many how connected traumas which\nIs coming right for you then what's the weather is now Yahoo Sports national columnist discovering this blockbuster trial surrounding how much guys are getting paid to go to play college basketball and dad is one reason why this isn't getting a ton of attention spans just don't care anymore\nI I Would think so I mean I don't know how you take good things here is like especially if they lose this trial because they're basically trying to stay committed a federal offense of wire fraud spiritual sort of walk by by offering the schools fought in the schools you made a player ineligible for these guys\nPaid Brian bowling junior to go to Louisville\nAnd by doing so they made him ineligible to play at Louisville and that's Louisville was defaulted because there had been algebra playing\nOut kick this coverage\nWith ... you want to talk about a way to start ... six AM eight thirty three I'm pushed it back on Fox Sports radio\nJunkie godly show when you think the media is anti Cam Newton the media voted him and beat the the media voted him Heisman Trophy winner\nIt still work may May Day I Am can and I just want to download them dollars just for the name too I hard radio another chance for you to win one thousand dollars coming up but by the hour every hour Monday through friday boring am until may be right here\nIs the biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their CWC I already all you\nYou'll miss the iconic performances John\nMiss [noise] Sunday\nOctober seventh what's new today on the free I her radio radio talk\nPerfect for decorating the house or just setting the theory move our pumpkins by the pilot has joke tracks with labor in mind when you know after a day\nWe're going to Larry Walker Jersey the guy's a millionaire on out only throwback or do you go to her and they did not show the river so let's get to the cold sores for a week five of the national football league these are guys you don't want to you don't want to see\nThem out of your lineup cold\nSores ready highbrow announces tomorrow Coopers in an odd week [noise]\nAnd I mean on the ... yeah wanting three's been terrible doing where he's been phenomenal this week he's got Casey hey we're on him [noise] I'll look for the secondary and tertiary options\nIt particularly Jared coast being bigger weapons for Derrick card this week are we taking markets Mario against buffalo I'm curious to see how he follows up last week performance rather Ninety school yards three total touchdowns look at buffalo still\nFairly solid thirteenth vast against opposing quarterbacks plus far this season on the verge of where he gave us has a fantasy world excited because you're trying to buy new number one wide receivers that break out he's a tough way though is buffalo\nA pretty good against the split as a as we go on a couple of cautionary tales the quarterback position in other words they're down markedly from where you don't really see him and the ranking and that's my homes\nAt home against Jacksonville I'm not going to bench I'm outright even with those Saudi numbers from Jacksonville but certainly we're not expecting thirty points [noise] going up against the squad many I'm Aaron Rodgers\nWith his bevy of injured wide receivers of on the ...

important to teach your kids what to do is they find a firearm\nWhether it's real or not they should always apply to simple rules stop don't touch go away and telling adult number firearm injuries are one of the top ten causes an accident related deaths in children\n\nYou're investing in in in the case of a lot of these accounts by the way you can invest off the top before taxes for maximum earnings value that way you defer the taxation all the way out to your retirement years\nSo you're accumulating your wealth in baby steps in order to get rich slowly\nAnd that's the way to do it in my opinion now\nThere are other types of accounts like Ross IRAs where you don't get that tax you don't get a money taken off the top you're putting after tax money into a raw diet re the benefit is as long as you follow the rules the score and you're going to grow tax free for you you don't have to pay taxes on it when you take it out\nBut either way the whole idea is the same idea to take at least ten percent of what you're making and put it into these types of accounts\n\nWe've talked also on the program about maximizing your tax deferred investments\nThat means you're four one K. for all three be for the sevens your IRAs all of these programs these tax privilege to uh programs are great way for you to build wealth over time all the way out to you're going to take it out way down the road\nSo that's another very important part of managing your money and building up toward reaching critical mass\nAlso very important to understand the difference between asked us an income because really over the long term it's the assets that will make the difference in your life now the income as the vehicle\nThat allows you to acquire assets and your net worth over your lifetime\nBut income can be fleeting\nA person can be making an excellent income something happens to them and then they can't do it anymore well there goes the income\nLook at these uh professional athletes we read about these players these professional athletes athletes a lot has been said about the athletes in the NFL\nWhere they'll make a huge amount of money over a short period of time and then unfortunately many of them have filed bankruptcy within ... years of retirement from they're relatively short careers\nAssets versus income very important to never be confused on that point never to misunderstand the words because income is here while you're earning it and that is wonderful but it's not the same as assets as such can be used\nTo generate income for the rest of your life that's a big deal\nThat's critical mass when you put together the asset based including our tax privileged accounts that will provide for you the ability\nTo earn income and interest income in the form of interest and also dividends for the rest of your life that the value of assets and that's the contribution to the assets make in reaching the land a critical mass\nAnd we're we've also talked about managing your money from the top down yes you'll have these different accounts but you also have the ability to manage your money from the top down so that you can make judgments about things like diversification\nThings like asset allocation\nVery very important to be able to do that and the top down management approach which is the one we like to think about here on Monday talk\nMoney John [noise]\nIf you or someone

America as money program where it's all about the money by Brinker here let's get Bill on the line and Springfield bill welcome to talk\nHello hello bill hello yeah I'm there what's that oh\nHey I got a question I just started taking your market timer newsletter and I'm looking through there and I see it represents something called current investment income and\nPortfolio won that you are having an example in the back\nHas almost no current investment income but portfolio three is heavy and current investment income so my question is I have a traditional R rated I Want to supplement my\nRetirement income with a pension and Social Security and my question is if I were to move into the court or we'll read it provides a lot of current investment income or someone like yours to recommend something like that to me\nHow do I get my hands on the current investment income or those just dividends an interest that I've received somehow without selling shares of my other re\nWell you're absolutely right bill that model portfolio one which is an aggressive growth portfolio has a it's really not um designed to generate current income is designed to generate growth\nAnd ah it certainly has done that uh if you look at the performance table or you will see that over the long term those portfolios have or don't extremely well\nNow model three would be a portfolio the balanced portfolio that's the third portfolio in the listing on page eight that portfolio is designed for those who are approaching or in retirement are you in that category\nI'll be in retirement in two months yes [noise]\nWell that's pretty close that's about as close as you can yeah yeah so uh so yes I Would certainly be looking model portfolio three in that situation you're in a and here's the answer to your question or is this personal money or is this tax privilege money that you're talking about\nPersonal money in a traditional Ira\nVersus money and oh it's ... it's it's in it but it's in an IRA\nCorrect are so all the money that comes out of there is coming out as ordinary income you understand the correct it will be taxed when I take it out\nIt'll be taxed at will be tax that ordinary income all of the money\nRight you'd take out of your traditional i._r._a. when you take it out and only when you take it out it's going to be taxed as ordinary income it will be subject to federal tax and also it will be subject to the Illinois state I Believe you have a flat tax in Illinois correct\nA traditional higher re monies are exempt in Illinois whoa\nHouse it is a ... I don't think everybody's I don't think everybody's gonna moved Illinois over that but hey All right and I think what we can get will take what we can get right that's correct hair ... here's the deal well that's good news so here's the deal then you just have to pay the federal freight on that\nAnd here's the answer to your question a you decide what you're going to withdraw from that account and anything that you withdraw\nYour beyond fifty nine and a half I presume right Oh yes uh-huh yes\nSo anything that you withdraw is coming out as ordinary income but in your case only at the federal rate because of you are say tax exemption law on IRA income which is a great law certainly support the law\nAnd uh what that means is that the dividends that are earned on your stocks in your mutual funds in a portfolio three you're interested is earned on those\nBond funds in a portfolio all of that comes into the portfolio in your tradition liar re but it can only come out as ordinary income so\nYour accumulating that in there and you're either putting your money fund in anticipation of withdrawing it or you're re investing it one of the other but from the standpoint of um\nWhat's going to happen to it\nIt's going to ... ... it's it either way it's going to stay in the traditional i._r._a. portfolio until you take it out as ordinary income do you have a plan to take money out\nI Am working on a plan now but what you just said they're to me it it can go into them money fund or be reinvest it currently I have checked for it to be reinvest it are you saying that I can\nAnd I have a money fund set up I can have a direct it to the money fund and from there than I can draw without selling any of my shares and get my supplemental income is that correct\nWho's your custodian vanguard\nI think that you can set it up then you can talk to them but I think you can set it up where you can have your account\nCoated they will code you recount\nWhere the money that comes in in interest from interest bearing and dividends from dividend paying all of that money would be directly\nPlaced into a the the vanguard prime money market I Would recommend the vanguard prime money market the symbol is um is a Victor\nA em em\nEh sex that would be Victor Amazon money ... money Sierra X ray and would you be able to do is you direct all of the money coming in that way into the money markets so that it would be available\nIn liquid form for any withdrawals that you make now I Would only do this if you're planning on making withdrawals out of that account now remember any any withdrawals that you make\nI have to wait by calling your addiction team you're taking the first steps to recovery to help you need to be one call away eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight make the\nFree call now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight your addiction teams are third party advertiser for various treatment centers and play some networks individual results will bury visit your addiction team dot com forward slash turns for more information for radio\nWhen kids are really fun I'm ... and ... and I'm putting your money when American your children's miracle and then when\nThey do seven this is John Green and if your teeth\nAre staying from coffee tea or smoking powered swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shades even better there is no messy strip search trees that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just swap you're cheap for five minutes and you're done to try power swabs call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine you're bright white smile will have your friends\nTalking about how great you look try at risk free\nOne eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nThat's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nAttention all authors page publishing as looking for authors have you written a book and want to get it published\nPage publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you printing ... publicity copyright and editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author so they should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\n[noise]\nIs money to [noise]\nFor the beaches of Waikiki to the shores of luck on a sound as America's Monday program\nMoney you talk about Brinker here thank you for joining us great to have you with us Ken welcome to money talk\nBob how're ya doing well what's up a\nQuick question for you I'm fifty three years old with a one point nine million network I currently have one point five million in my four oh one K. retirement\nAnd I'm currently at Seventy five twenty five but I'm look I'm actually thinking about going ...

on your mind today\nOh thanks for taking this call I'm a longtime subscriber in a long time listener and my question is about a pensions I'm a uh I'm fifty six and a half and eligible to receive a pension payment or her time in\nService when I hit sixty and I intend to take that\nAnd are they call and our benefits they said that a pension is ah backed up by the pension benefit guarantee corporation like pensions going to be about thirty four hundred a month\nAnd uh that are looking up information on the uh looks like\nA for payments for twenty Eighteen on those are guaranteed for about thirty five hundred a month and benefits said they're guaranteed perhaps about five thousand a month I question for you is that I have anything to worry about as far as that uh income stream that portion of my income income stream and retirement\n[noise]\nWell uh it would seem to me that any pension that you have earned would be dependent on their ability to meet their pension obligations is that makes sense do you\nMake sense to me and I was at stand right now\nYou know they've they've been under stress their attention a obligations are underfunded but um [noise] that from what I understood that\nAre that the pension benefit guarantee corpus somewhat of an analogous to FDIC insurance that\nAh it's paid for by companies that participate and you're not if you have a ... a large pension or let's say whatever eighty grant or something like that it that that's not going to be covered but after a certain amount the architect Cabot am I Am I correct in that or am I mistaken\nI Would say this that I'm thirty four hundred dollars a month that's an annual pension of over forty thousand dollars a year\nSo what I what I Would check would be what the limits or on the pension benefit guarantee corporation payouts relative to what you are expecting because I mean that's what's going to determine if\nAnd if this thing winds up in the hands of a\nPension benefit guarantee then the question is will you get all or most of what you were expecting so I Would inquire at pension benefit guarantee to see what their limits are and and how that would compare to your situation\n[noise] yeah this uh this money\nAt age sixty ... it would be a about like maybe thirty five percent of my income stream that I counted on at sixty so I mean I had uh my uh four one K. and my IRA money is and basically it expands I at the desk that I can with your\nChoice as a model Europe your act to pass at portfolio\nIn my own personal investments are but I mean this this uh this money would come in handy you know and and I I just want to see if it's something that I have to have the plan on and like you said I Will look up look up the government website and look up pension benefit guarantee and yeah and and\nSee what the details or yeah that's what I Would do but I mean I my guess would be the worst case\nAnd this is only a guess but worst case which seemed to me you'd be likely to get a even with pension benefit guarantee you'd be likely to get a really good chunk of that pension income worst case\nThat that sort of kinda sounded like it kinda sounded like from the tables the information that I looked up yeah\nAnd that for you know on and I'm looking to be paid that I'd be pretty much covered and find out what it sounds like it was good that is a pension benefit guarantee is somewhat of an ally gets to a FDIC insurance\nWell I think there are I don't like that can uh let me tell you why I don't like that comparison nobody's ever lost the nickel\nNobody's ever lost a nickel in a in a fully insured balance by the FDIC All right they have a perfect record of paying off everybody with uninsured amount up to the insurance limit\nAnd I and I think that that's what makes your situation different because in the case of pension benefit guarantee you there are a lot of people who have only received a portion of their pension because their pension that they earned was greater than what pension benefit guarantee pays out so that's the difference\nGot it so for what they pay out for what they pay out the percentage or the amount that they do pay out on a ...\nI Believe that uh I Believe that if I were in that position I Would expect them to pay a\nOkay you've answered my question\nTo Rob appreciate the call great to hear from Lincoln\nI knew someone

T. M. F.\nExchange traded mutual funds and that's the third category now the really big difference between open and funds\nThat are no load overload funds and exchange traded funds is the fact that exchange traded mutual funds E. T. apps trade during the day\nBut of course they share that trait in common with the other category closed and mutual funds closed and mutual funds are generally listed on an exchange and trade during the day so some people mistakenly think that the only types of\nMutual funds that trade during the day or exchange traded mutual funds frequently referred to as ... not true\nAnother entire class of mutual funds the closed end mutual funds also trade during the day the only class of mutual funds that is priced to ... only on the clothes\nThat would be the open and mutual funds now as we mentioned within the context of the open and mutual funds you have two categories you have the know load open and mutual funds\nAnd then you have the loaded open and mutual funds\nNow if you're a money talk regular you already know\nI have always concentrated on the no load open ended mutual funds because you don't pay a sales commission\nTo purchase or redeem the shares why should you there's no reason when there are thousands upon thousands of no load open and mutual funds no reason at all\nTo pay a commission to buy or redeem shares in a mutual fund so that's the opening category in the know load area and then you have the load area\nWhich can charge you five six percent or more just to buy the shares or just to redeem the shares hey that's your money going down the drain\nI don't recommend that of course of action ever\nThen of course we have the closed and mutual funds the thing you want to be aware of with the closed and mutual funds which can trade at a discount or a premium to the net as that value\nYou want to remember that if you are looking at an initial public offering there's usually about five percent commission\nPriced into the offering price now what does that mean that means that if you buy a closed and mutual fund\nThe initial public offering at twenty five dollars a share there's probably about it\nTwenty five and commission in that price what does that mean to you that means that you get the shaft because the twenty five dollars that you paid for that initial public offering closed and share actually has a net as a value on day one\nOf just twenty three dollars and Seventy five cents if it has a five percent embedded commission which is very common place and the closed and marketplace\nThat's why there's really no reason as a general rule to be buying a closed and mutual fund on an I. P. O. Y. so that you get the privilege of paying a five percent or so commission\nWell that's no prevalence at all some people would look upon that more as a rip off so with a closed in funds once you get that now that said value at a\nAt the same price as the share price then you have parity frequently you'll see discounts in a closed and mutual fund because the price of the shares is completely dependent on supply and demand in the marketplace cause they trade like stuck\nAnd so it's quite common for a closed and mutual fund to trade at a discount sometimes they'll trade it a premium in either case the net assets value is what it is underlying shares\nAnd that brings us back to that third category which is the more recent a category and that's the exchange traded mutual fund so anytime you your E. T. F. always remember this because very few people will tell you this but I Will\nWhenever you hear that acronym ATF the true accurate the true accurate it would be E. T. M. F. exchange traded mutual\nFun now exchange traded funds trade during the day and that is the big difference between the exchange traded mutual fund and the open and mutual fund the open and mutual fund is priced on the clothes every business day\nAnd can be trends acted purchased or redeemed on that price every day whereas the exchange traded mutual fund the ATF\nThat's trading all during the trip a trading day depending on which exchanges listed on so these are the fine points the key points to know\nWhen you're talking about mutual funds open ended mutual funds which are priced to trends act at the clothes each day based on the net assets value of the securities within the fun\nAnd they can be no low which means you do pay a commission to buy a redeem or they can be low which means you get hit over there was a kid they should either to buy or to redeem and I see no reason to go down that road\nThen the second category the closed and mutual funds that we talked about in detail and then the third category which is the relatively newer category the exchange traded mutual funds\nAnd that's the agency on mutual funds I bought breaker [noise]\nMoney Jong [noise]\nHey guys can hear from hip typecast today's growth\nWho would win at three mile bicycle racing eleven year old girl or last year's winner the Tour de France it all depends on the bicycle it depends on their vehicle both in a ten speed in the ... going to win every time but but the race around the trace Ikle in the eleven year old winds every time you see it's not the driver it's the vehicle\nWhen it comes to generating revenue it's exactly the same if you have a job or a small business you are writing a trace it all you can only go so fast if you need to make up ... it's not going to happen on a tray sickle no matter how fast you pedal it's simply not going to win the race why do many people with no schooling and no advanced degree often become very wealthy simple\nThey choose to only right ten speed when it comes to helping people create their next revenue model both Forbes any recommend income store as a can't miss when it comes to putting people in it tends to be good your household or business using additional revenue model that doesn't solely dependent on you if so you need to check out income store dot com that's income store dot com\nThis is John Green and if your teeth are staying from coffee tea or smoking power swabs as the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shapes even better there is no messy strips are trace that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just wipe your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try and power swabs call one eight hundred\nSix seven eight nine ... nine six night\nYour bright white smile will have your friends talking about how you look try at risk free one\nEight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night this\nIs John Green and if your teeth are staying from coffee tea or smoking powered swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shades even better there is no messy strip search trays that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just wipe your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try Paris rubs call one eight hundred\nSix seven nine o nine six night\nYou're white white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try at risk free one\nEight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night\nMessaging data ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text trend\nTo seven nine six four or five\nThat's T.

stock market prices are Robert Shiller and talks about this long term ... turn in a consumer confidence and uses the term complacency\nLet me just say something about Robert Shiller a couple of things number one I think Robert Shiller is a really smart guy I think Robert Shiller is a highly intelligent individual having said that I think his ten year\nUm trailing earnings model\nIs deeply flawed deeply flawed because it includes in it or periods of deep drop in earnings periods like\nEspecially two thousand two thousand nine and what happens is when you include when you normalize periods like that by putting them into a ten year timeframe\nThan what I think happens is you get a distorted you get a distorted answer\nI've always felt this way about the uh the Robert Shiller work and about his valuation work and I have to say and I'm not trying to I'm not trying to be negative on Robert Shiller and I'll tell you why because it's not in my nature\nTo be negative on somebody else in the business but I have to tell you this\nHis work in terms of its valuation work on the market it's been completely wrong\nIt's been totally wrong that's pretty interesting\nWell looking at our look at is ten year look at his tenure earning a number look at the valuation work that's come out of that ten year timeframe and look at what the market has done and you will see that that value wishing work has been completely misleading\nAnd that if you had actually followed that valuation work it would have been impossible for you to be fully invested as we had been in the market timer investment letter\nYeah so I mean that's that's why it's a big deal because you know why it's a big deal John this is why because there are only a handful of times\nAnother time was Ninety nine which was the end of an incredible five year run in the uh total market where you had the gains of over twenty percent five consecutive years which ended at the end of Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd we know what followed that well it's very very important and we were fully invested back then too\nSo it's very very important to take full advantage of such times as these because here's why because they're extremely rare extremely rare I mean if you wanted to call this a stock market melt up\nIt would be hard to criticize you if you if you said something like that it would be really hard to criticize you so I mean we

because after all knowledge is power a time in Scottsdale, Arizona hello there Tom\nBlow their Kemp what's going on well I have a\nQuestion uh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah have ah a website that I have one son mind right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a ... a function I'm not sure what you call it a in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you ... you would do is it are easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as the employment of people to support that to the questions or what have you\nYou know all of us all yeah all really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have some of them play so I just recently was approached by a company that said that they would do is they would have ah\nThey employ individuals to support the ah the ... function somehow that would work because they would give me dirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a prospective clients would ask and then those are three questions so I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call in and they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question though she they had the the canned answer that I've already given\nBut of course I'd almost should include she looked at those dirty question\nYeah ... and say here's the reason why I'm hesitating with that is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor\nI'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my role hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the Web site see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office said you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact uh getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your site from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building it for you\nAh yes well the the we do have a website it's already been built and we have another company building a another website all over again but but when we have a third tempting is calling me about that in the chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet\nI Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters do kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also lift some of those questions under FA cues as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and bought and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you

E. ratio most especially things like inflation expectations and interest rates\nSo when we take a look at the historical range of PE ratios as they would apply for example to the standard and Poor's five hundred index we see that over the very very long term the range has been quite wide\nFor example back in Nineteen Seventy four when the stock market was in the throes of a brutal bear market that lasted for close to two full years\nBecause the bear market back then that led to that very very low historical valuation figure started in January of Nineteen Seventy three in fact it started\nRight at the same time that the peace treaty was signed with North Vietnam bringing an end to the war in Vietnam so we're back to January Seventy three and the market right at the time the peace treaty is signed\nEditors bear market and by the end of Nineteen Seventy four nearly a full two years later like twenty three months later\nThe market finally reaches its final bottom in December of Nineteen Seventy four and the interesting thing about this is the valuation level on a price to earnings ratio basis that prevailed at the end of Nineteen Seventy four at the end of that brutal bear market\nThe ... the ratio was basically the lowest ever the market was trading and I speak of the S. and P. five hundred index here was trading basically at seven times earnings and so that was an extremely low level of valuation\nAnd then we have the polar opposite which is the record high level of evaluation for the U.S and the five hundred into action that occurred back in the early part of the new millennium in fact it occurred in January two thousand\nAnd January two thousand\nThe ah to march of two thousand call it the first quarter of year two thousand\nWe saw the price to earnings ratio on the standard and Poor's five hundred index escalate to a record high which was basically thirty times earnings think about this now in December of Nineteen Seventy four at the bottom of the massive bear market that lasted almost two years\nWe had a valuation of seven times earnings on a price to earnings ratio bases\nWell look at that extreme and the first quarter of two thousand when you had that level up to basically thirty times earnings that is more than four times greater\nThan the low evaluation that prevailed\nAt the bottom of the Nineteen Seventy three Nineteen Seventy four bear market\nSo there we have a range including the extremes of the range so we can mark down okay\nWe have a say you're seven and December Seventy four basically that's his lowest it's been historically this is for the U.S and the five hundred index and then we have the figure of thirty in the first quarter of year two thousand\nAnd that's the highest it's been\nFor the U.S and the five hundred index so we could call that the total range including the extreme low in the extreme high\nThen we have a range of normalcy and the range of normalcy would be in the mid to on occasion the upper teens\nCertainly a range of normalcy would be in the Fifteen to sixteen times earnings range however\nDuring extended bull markets you can see a slightly higher range of normalcy which can reach as high as Seventeen to Eighteen times earnings now\nThis gives you an idea of what to expect most of the time\nMost of the time you're going to have a price earnings ratio is going to be from the mid to the upper teens something in the general area of Fifteen times earnings\nRanging up to something in the general area of Eighteen times earnings and that is how you can determine what the valuation of the market is relative to its historical record\nObviously inflation is very important here because the higher the rate of inflation than ah the um the last\nUh integrity is given to future earnings because the future earnings are degraded because of inflation because of the degradation of buying power that results due to inflation\nObviously in a low inflation inflation environment or that is good for a price to earnings ratios because those future earnings are worth more when inflation rates are low\nI bought Brinker this money's talk [noise]\nMoney Chong

hello but\nHey how're you doing today Bob\nThanks ... what's up\n[noise] hey I Would just like to get your uh advice or my wife and myself with both like to take Social Security at age sixty two and just to see what your opinion would be taking it then early because\nMost people would like us to work to sixty five or sixty seven\nWell that's your decision but uh as long as you aware are aware of what you're living on the table potentially in a lot of this has to do with life expectancy\nAnd you know if you're a heavy smoker you don't expect to be around long anyway is sixty two is fine but uh keep in mind that you are living on the table if you expect longevity\nYou are living on the table above than eight percent increase annually and your Social Security benefit by delaying each year\nRight when we get to I think we'll be at that critical mass by sixty two we're going to have almost a million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved and I do and we are eligible for both pages from the state of Florida\nAnd with our pensions and everything else we're looking at about making about eighty eight thousand dollars a year in income at that time in our life\nNow does that eighty eight thousand include the early taking of Social Security\nYes\nOkay so is that enough for you to be a way to meet your standard of living are to be a net saver or what does what does eighty eight thousand do for you\nWell it's ah almost what we make now okay here early um are at my pension is three will be three thousand a year plus\nAlmost two and a half percent increase for the rest of my life\nA Social Security be about sixteen hundred and she'll be able to work till she's age sixty five plus draw Social Security because she doesn't make that much money at the school districts you were working you know\nHere's my answer Bob and and I want you to think about it I Would ... you fill out the blanks but I Would not take the Social Security any earlier than you have to take it and I'm going to tell you why\nBecause every year you're delaying it goes up about eight percent an annual income value therefore I Would take the Social Security only when you need the money\nOkay All right thanks for your ah opinion on that appreciate it\nBob thank you for calling let's get Patricia on the line in a Chicago hello Patricia\nHi I'm In a subscriber and I'm enjoying today's much thank

on Monday talk thank you for joining us\nAnd certainly on our broadcast over the years we have discussed some some some critical factors that you can incorporate into your investment management to help you along the way and we've talked in detail about a number of these not the least of which is diversification\nWhere you are diversifying your portfolio money over a many different investments not putting all of your eggs in one basket and we've talked in detail and you know it's something that's come up and that is the issue of how much money you put it in any one stock how many times can you recall\nThat people have called into the broadcast investors have called in and said well you know I have all my money in the stock or most of my money or whatever\nAnd it's just not good investments sense to do that because what you do when you concentrate your investments in one stock did you expose yourself to something that is known as specific company risk\nAnd specific company risk is a big deal if you focus on just one company\nIf something goes wrong with the business model or in some other way something goes wrong with your company like Enron for example than the money's gone and that's the reason that we have talked so many years about our four percent guideline\nAnd our four percent guideline is basically an offshoot of modern portfolio theory that's all it is and in modern portfolio theory it has been documented that if you own twenty five stocks\nA lot different than all your money in one or two stocks if you own twenty five stocks with an application of about four percent or a full portfolio as soon as you're doing your own stock picking if you owned twenty five stocks\nAcross many different industries not twenty five drugs stocks not twenty five tech stocks only five stocks across many different industries\nThat what you can do in that portfolio is you can achieve a level of diversification\nThat will avoid this problem of all my wanting in money and wants to all my money in one industry group and that is really a very very strong tenet of investment management that idea of diversification and then there's asset allocation especially\nSomeone that's approaching or in their retirement years\nAsset allocation makes so much sense where they're going to adopt a balanced investment portfolio or they're going to have a portion of their portfolio allocated to the stock market\nAnd that includes a portion of that in the international community stock market and then they're going to have a portion of their investment portfolio in the fixed income area\nAnd there are many different ways to invest in fixed income securities and many of those are government guaranteed like FDIC insured CDs or treasury instruments\nSo asset allocation is another of the key tenets of investment management keeping expenses as low as something we've talked about on this broadcast for more than a quarter century because when you keep those expenses low on your portfolio\nThat means that there's more money going into your pocket and less money going into an advisors pocket and that's good because you wind up with more money at the end of the day\nAnd so keeping expenses down is a big deal and you know a good part of that can be done by incorporating something we've talked about and that's including index funds in your portfolio index funds might be the total stock market index that might be the S. and P. five hundred they might be the um\nThat they might be the Russell three thousand but index funds can go a long way to doing two things virtually keeping your expenses down which is great and secondly guaranteeing you you're not going to under perform you cannot under perform [noise] on the index portion of a

doing I think they're way better off\nWith a service like that then making a lot of mistakes\nWhen I'll a with a robo adviser you are saying well\nThe one that I described yes I think that if somebody has available to them something like that at a low cost\nAnd is going to provide them with some guidance as opposed to being out there and having an absolutely no idea in the world what they're doing\nThat's a recipe for disaster so I think in a case like that uh it it makes sense to me\nThank you for the call\nMoney talks comes your way each and every weekend as we talk about subjects

as well we talk about everything here from investing in your four O. one K. or for oh three B to saving for all of those important future goals education for the young sprouts\nOur view is that you can get that job done by acquiring the\nKnowledge the knowledge that empowers you to control your financial future and\nUm you can do some really good forward planning and one of the things you might want to do is take advantage of some of those tax privileged accounts that are out there\nAre lots of opportunities out there you have the opportunity to put money aside in your um your IRA program whether it'd be the traditional i._r._a. or the Roth IRA\nThat's five thousand five hundred dollars for those under the age of fifty and six thousand five hundred dollars for those age fifty or more even if you have a non working spouse you\nCan open an IRA for the non working spouse as long as it's funded by you're running and has to be covered by earned income earned income so that's another opportunity to put money aside you can make a fully deductibles traditional i._r._a. contribution to qualify\nAnd um\nThat's another way to get money working for the future now that way you get a duck should\nYou get a fully deductible contribution to a tradition liar way is qualified but you can also do a real diary if you prefer if you qualify for that program the amounts are the same fifty five hundred for those under fifty sixty five hundred for fifty plus\nAnd do our income\nThresholds for Roth IRA eligibility\nAnd these are all terrific ways outstanding ways for you to put money away for the future whether it'd be in the traditional higher rate the Roth IRA re the most important thing of all is that you take advantage to the max that you can afford\nAnd the other most important thing of all is to absolutely take advantage and at a minimal\nTake advantage of the full matching provision if you have a matching provision to so many companies do in a four O. one K. some for three days this is the definition of free money if anybody ever asked you what is there such a thing as free money the hazards yes\nAnd free money is represented by the matching contribution that your company will give you\nIn a four O. one K. or similar type plant because if you meet the minimum standard let's say they say well we'll give you three percent if you put in six will match half of your contribution\nUp to six percent so you put insects they add three\nNine goes in nine percent goes in of your salary and yes that three percent the company is throwing in there that is the definition of free money that is like a raise that the company is offering you but you have to be smart enough to take it\nBy at least reaching the minimal\nContribution standard\nThat you would have to make but that's a great way for you to put money aside as well\nThis is a great\nTime for you to maximize your charitable giving uh my favorite charity as the U.S funds for UNICEF which does great work for children around the world\nI Would also point out that there is a terrific provision in the tax law which is now a permanent law\nThat you can give to your favorite charities directly from your IRA this has to be done directly from your custodian to the charity or or charities of your choice so you don't handle the money you direct your custodian to make the gift or gifts\nNow in the case of an individual you're allowed to give up to one hundred thousand dollars a year\nTo your favorite charities directly from your custodian to the charities from your IRA and if you do that as part of your required minimum distribution you don't have to pay income tax on that money up to a hundred thousand\nAnd some of you I Know one person has an IRA and the spouse has an area where you can both do it\nUp to a hundred thousand each on an annual basis your favorite charities instructor your custodian\nTo make those gifts you may have been planning to make 'em anyway it'll give cash give orange day money because you're not going to have to pay income tax\nOn this money that had to come out of the IRA anyway as part if you had it as part of a required minimum distribution so there's no reason

Fox is Brett Baer there seems to be a rush to judgment\nYour insurance future\nSo many other things that are keys we've talked about saving a minimum if you can afford to do so a minimum of ten percent of your income\nBecause that's the money that you're going to invest in your um IRA or your four one K. or your four oh three baby or tax privilege to count whatever it may be\nAnd that's the money that over time can compound and grow for you until you reach retirement age level now\nI liked the idea of putting more than ... percent frankly if you can afford to put a Fifteen Percent or twenty percent more power to you\nBecause that will obviously accumulate better but\nAt a minimum level if you can afford to do so I Would establish ten percent as that minimum now another topic that we've talked about that so critical is paying those credit cards off on a monthly basis because you accomplished two things\nWhen you pay your credit cards off on a monthly basis number one you don't accumulate some massive usually high interest\nRate debt that you really don't want as part of your future financial picture you don't do that when you pay them all monthly but the second thing that happens is it works as a discipline on avoiding excessive spending\nBecause if you cannot afford to pay it off on a monthly basis then all you're doing is piling up debt something that I Know many of you may not want to do\nAnother thing that I think is important and you know when you listen to the money talks colors you hear that a lot of people have some work to do on this one and that is when you're approaching or in your retirement years\nYou really want to think about a balanced investment portfolio now a balanced investment portfolio edits basic form\nAs a fifty percent allegations of the stock market and the fifty percent allocation to income producing securities\nAnd the whole idea about using a balanced portfolio approaching or in your retirement years is to manage your risk\nYou don't want to be taking a lot of risk when you're at that point in the investment cycle and the way for you to modify that risk control that risk managed it if you will is by adopting a balanced investment portfolio\nThat contains an equal amount or close to an equal amount in stock market investments highly diversified of course\nAnd an income producing security's so that's a thought that I think is that the core of investing which is the adoption of a balanced investment portfolio approach approaching or in your retirement years\nAnd these are are some of the key things that I think that you can do to make a difference\nI'm Bob Brinker this Monday talk [noise]\nMoney John [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] no\nMatter how modern your family might be here paddling around

there I'm I'm I'm about two years from retirement and as I uh moved from portfolio one\nInto portfolio three\nI'm following the four percent rule which I've learned on your show and I appreciate uh\nHow do you go about harvesting that four percent when you're diversify\nBetween the index funds from the bond funds um so you have like one check coming in a ... at the end of the month\nWell what I Would do a certainly it would be a lot easier if you had these are assets assembled at one custodians at the case\n[noise] uh I'm not an portfolio three now I'm I'm In portfolio one [noise] and um\nWell congratulations you've uh definitely definitely done extremely well\nYeah we're we're getting close for getting really close um they they the the friend that I stumbled upon it at vanguard was the vanguard managed payout fun and it's they would control the money in their portfolio and automatically send you one check at four percent and it's a man that well\nThat's that's what I was that's what I was getting it okay 'cause that would mean that would mean without commenting on that particular fund that would mean you ... you have a single custodian so here's the way\nLet me use model portfolio three sets the portfolio you were asking about yeah let me use use that and that's the portfolio the most commonly\nOur subscribers used for purposes of using the four percent withdraw

America worldwide on the Web is America's money program money talk I think that\nThose who live in the high tech states are going to have to fess up to reality I'm not saying they're going to like it but I think reality is this is a guy to moment this is a gotcha moment where the federal government has passed a law and they got you\nAnd if you have the ... on state and local taxes of all kinds of nexus of ten thousand dollars they got you\nI don't expect anybody in that position to like it but I Do expect them to do the obvious which is seriously look at relocation it doesn't have to be that way there are places all over the country some of which have no have no state income taxes\nNow what is that going to do that's going to take away from the high earner population because those are the people that would have the um the motive\nTo make a change and\nThere are still many places around the country where you can make a change\nI mean look at the situation between Oregon and Washington Oregon a high state income tax Washington zero Washington state uh uh there were other states places around the country where the same thing is true\nAnd a look at look at the state like Texas surrounded by states with relatively high state income taxes are states like Oklahoma for example\nWell there you go Texas is not that far from Oklahoma and there are examples like this all over the country look at the difference between North Dakota and South Dakota I Know not many people are there but some of them are there and listen to money talk\nIn places like Fargo in Sioux Falls and others and I can tell you right now\nThere's a big difference in state income tax between North Dakota and South Dakota because South Dakota doesn't have any\nSo you have this situation all over the country Georgia and Florida very very good example high state income tax no state income tax this is a situation all over the country people are going to look at this now because this can be really big money for a high earner\nAnd so people can look at this and say\nJust makes a big difference so these are the kinds of considerations that people will continue\nTo make and it's just logic it's basic logic to expect people to ignore this would be to expect ... suspect people not to care about their money will people do care about their money Clark is on the line in Baton Rouge although clerk\nYeah hello\nThanks for taking my call itself a been retired since June of ah twenty eleven and a half kept the majority of a bond funds that stable value on over that time frame it goes a low interest rates and\nIt's worked out pretty good but it looks like me\nIt's time to be changed by strategy and start move it into your low duration income funds 'cause I've been doing that with some of my money for a couple of years ago I noticed that ah I'm making about twice as much as a stable by you\nAnd a cat or the that go to a that's going to improve over time going forward [noise] and so I just wanted to get a second opinion mute does it make sense maybe start doing that\nShift now that it should have your stable normalize what is your stable value of thing you\nIt's paying me right at the last ... last year it was to herself and they're all a rated phones are contracts\nAnd you have no risk your principal at all\nVery very little yeah\n... ... it's a very tough it's a very tough question to answer and I'll tell you why [noise] uh\nIt's very difficult to know going forward what the rates of return are going to be because of the propensity of interest rates to reflect what's going on in the economy and thereby for the fed to reflect what's going on in the economy with reference to interest rate in monetary policy so it's a it's a very very tough call\nTo make a for recall on what the income portfolio is going to earn and but it's very difficult to make that kind of a projection versus what you seem to be saying is a guarantee two percent [noise] yeah\nAnd it and it it would it at the beginning of my retirement\nIt was much better than that it was around four in there but yeah as these contracts mature you know they lack the interest rates going down and so you know the return of slowly degraded in one day when they start to normalize and go back up the same thing's going to happen and I got to go up very fast\nAnd you have a point in time I got to figure out what I make switch and\nWell I mean maybe that maybe there will be a time clerk when you can make that kind of a judgment but my response to your question right now is it's a very very tough comparison to make based on what we know right now and I do appreciate the call\nThis was money talk [noise]\nMoney John [noise]\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you

designate is to create a will\nAnd obviously if you have a simple estate things are not complicated there or do it yourself resources that you can use I don't particularly recommend this track because I'm concerned that if a mistake is made there's going to be a problem\nSo I don't really like this particular track but yeah there are ways out there that it can be done\nVery very important item and you know over the years on Monday talk or for our regular listeners and we thank you for that by the way while we're on the thought\nSo many of our listeners over the years of called about rip offs and I was reading an article this weekend in the New York times about this very topic a very good article that appeared in the Saturday New York times and it really is a cautionary tale\nFor those of you involved with for example with your parents money\nMaybe involving business with the brokerage and how many times that we had callers on money talks talked about this very topic where they have a ...\nThis particular story that I reference and I recommend to money talkers involves a brokerage account at a major US Bank you know a lot of the banks have brokerage arms so this account was at one of those brokerage arms the details are named in the article\nSo\nThe daughter of of the individual that was the focus of the article the daughter of that individual\nFound that there was unusual activity in her mother's account was she was overseeing and had been overseeing in recent years and one of the things that caught our attention\nWas at the account dropped one hundred thousand dollars in just one month during a period while the market was increasing most of this money was in the market despite the fact that her mother was in her eighties which doesn't make a lot of sense to me but that's what the article says and I'm sure that was the case\nSo the account was very very heavily in the stock market despite the advanced age of the owner of the account\nSo the daughter hired council hired a forensic accountant or a forensic consultant one of the other and they found commissions and the account for the year\nOf one hundred twenty eight thousand dollars\n\nOne hundred twenty eight thousand in commission's charge that the ... the year which was about ten percent of the total value of the account this amount being paid out than commissions in a relatively short period of time\nWhat what happened was most of the portfolio had been sold out and then the money to reinvest it and of course the commission's piling up on all of these transactions and in one month alone they found three hundred forty four trades\nThis is really staggering and it's real and these were in the unsolicited category well unsolicited means directed by the customer but of course that was not true the the mother of this story was not directing these trades in any way shape or form\nAlso another thing they found when they did their forensic work was pieces of stock we're being sold in small watch so if you had a thousand shares you might sell Seventy five than a hundred and twenty five and so on and so on even in the same day\nAnd of course that can pile up the commission says well sometimes the commission's can be larger on usually they are larger on the smaller\nLots sit ups the commission costs as well another thing they found was that was a margin account which allows you to borrow money to invest more well you don't do that when you're in your rabies and if you really smart you don't do it at all\nSo as the article describes there was a settlement was reached but obviously the overall result of this was kind of ugly and unpleasant\nAnd this is something that's common excessive an unauthorized trading are among the top complaints in customer arbitration and this is according to the financial industry regulatory authority ...\nAnd the FCC has issued an alert about churning they call this churning when you're excessively trading and account\nThey issued a warning just last year on this so this is something to be aware of if you have elderly parents and you're wondering what is going on with an account they may have at a brokerage or whatever or the bank rivers as in this case it's something to be aware of because I'll tell you why I said this\nThe sharks are always swim shark swim twenty four seven they never rest\nAnd I don't want them to take

quick questions of course I listen you're not on live in LA I listen to you on TALK shows why\nAre we are on ... we are on we ... we are on a ... a different schedule but we are on KBC Los Angeles you'll have to check the station for the schedule that they keep yes we are on KBC\nBut not live I'm so sometime sometimes is the answer is sometimes\nOkay great listen I have a I'm retiring next year\nOr have a four hundred and fifty K. and um [noise] some funds that I wanted to invest in number three ... number three [noise]\nAnd um I I Want it to find out when you talk about dollar cost averaging One Fund that size you typically suggest you know four five six pieces um per dollar cost averaging\nAnd at the at the back a little bit of a background you know we just passed this last week the longest running ... market catching up the nineties\nAnd that's why I'm anticipating\nBased on your mark where which was very helpful in October letter or a year ago you said trenches term shut back this year and so I took advantage of that thank you very much\nA that does help pay for the you know the letter many many times over a but anticipating a market a topic and the next let's just say the next year year and a half um dollar cost averaging ... family how many\nA piece of should I be putting my money into our apple you know how should it be breaking up into\nWell uh when would you be doing this investing right now\nI Would be doing it yeah within the next month or two\nYeah I Would say on model three on a fixed income side of the portfolio that um I don't\nI don't regard need right now and the central need for dollar cost averaging on a fixed income side\nAnd the reason I say that as we've largely inoculated that fixed income side of the portfolio by selecting a short duration portfolio assets in fact our average duration on a fixed income side now is less than one year\nAnd so with an average duration of less than one year and the current ills on that portfolio in terms of the interest income stands that a little bit over three percent\nI think we've covered the basis on that side of the portfolio we're getting a nice yield\nIn terms of the current income and we've a reduced the duration down to a\nVery very low level on equity side really that comes down to your tolerance for risk to some degree\nBecause the fact of the matter is that um\nIf you're going to a dollar cost averaging money and you want to do it in a way where if something goes awry in the market you're not going to panic and do something in this going to be counterproductive\nSo I Would move it in on a schedule that you're comfortable with in terms of of your tolerance for risk and I think that would be the key in terms of of how you'd be moving that money and\nYou're absolutely right we're looking at a market that is basically the longest bull market all cyclical bull market ever were nine and a half years and so are there had been times to get really excited about putting money in the market\nUh I remember the a secondary by signal we had a secondary means we were fully invested so it applies to those looking for an opportunity we had a great a well an awesome secondary by signal in um\n[noise] back in two thousand\nEleven back in September of two thousand eleven yes be five hundred was in the low eleven hundreds I mean this things than the twentieth hundreds now so that was an awesome by signal we had back in September of two thousand eleven\nAnd a and I remember also we had a a terrific secondary by signal because we were already fully invested so this was for those looking for that opportunity that exceptional opportunity\nAnd that occurred again in um February of two thousand sixteen for crying out loud the SP five hundred was in the Eighteen hundreds or talking about an index is twenty hundreds now it was in the Eighteen hundreds in February of two thousand six team won again we had a secondary by signal\nSo I mean they were fantastic opportunities but but\nThey don't come along every day opportunities like that don't come along every day so um I mean even people that dollar cost average money into the market in two thousand Eighteen at the at the lowest level we've seen they were still in the twenty six hundred area\nThe lowest closing level we've seen in two thousand Eighteen\nWas only in the twenty six hundred area no big deal we're in the twenty eight hundreds so those kinds of opportunities that we saw in September of two thousand eleven would the S. and P. five hundred trading and the low eleven hundreds wow that's a buying opportunity big time\nUh and the kind of opportunity we saw in February of two thousand six team with the S. and P. five hundred trading in the Eighteen hundreds well that was a terrific buying opportunity for certain\nAverage clients settles for about ten percent of what is owed we offer free face to face consultations in your local area call eight

downtown cross town on your radio across America world one on the Web\nIt's money talk where it's all about the money that's getting out to Algonquin, Illinois Wally welcome\nOh Bob [laughter] I um I have a grandson\nWho was sixty just turned sixteen and I would like thing of the stock market\nHe's got a head on a ... you just received the ... of around twenty five grand\nAnd they had a savings account prior to that but he saved up to like Fifteen hundred bucks over a long period of time and I would have ... paper work out you know so it so he was doing something I Would like to have\nTo know uh I was thinking about fidelity or or um uh\nOne of the uh the scope stock houses where you can get information\nBut then have him do the you know do the actual trade when it comes to talk about it together and try to pick the right one and then start investing some of this money got\nWhat we know what I mean I think I think it's a good idea I think that a meal only need a three thousand dollars to open a a a personal personal account how old is this youngster\nSixty\nYeah okay well you want to have it ... through may yeah\nOK you have to do a cuss the custody accountant actually ... but then he'll get to be Eighteen ...\nAnyway [laughter] so he says\nI'm I'm ... so he doesn't get tempted with the with the money you know [laughter]\nWell I I I think that it's fairly easy for a personal account for example would probably about three thousand dollars a vanguard probably about twenty five hundred dollars or so at the ... the first one that I Would buy would be to get started would be the double the sparked in\nTotal stock market index or vanguard till the stock market index depending on which company you go to but I think that's a great way to get started and then they can dollar cost averaging says he wishes going forward\nI think the only caviar is that you know as he is going to need money\nIf he's going to need money going forward then you know\nHe's in a position where he has an investment account in that case in the stock market which certainly tends to fluctuate as we know\nAnd so there should be money that he really is investing a on a longer term basis I think as as it gets started move as opposed to a money that he's actually going to need to go forward while the appreciate the call bill is in Missouri bill it's your turn\nI thank you for taking my call I'm trying to determine the best way to withdraw money from investments when I retire\nI'd like to tell you the two approaches I'm considering the first one would be to take four percent of my investments each year starting with non IRA one Sasha gone go to regular IRA\nAnd then ... fire re approach number two would be to take all of my interest dividends and capital gains\nAnd then if I have money left at the end of the year I weighed reinvest it\nDoes that make sense\nWell I think it makes a lot of sense for you to collect your interest and your dividends against that four percent withdraw guideline that you're starting with because I think what you're going to find is you will you will have some years\nWhere the some of your interest and dividends and capital appreciation could exceed that four percent figure and certainly uh I Would reinvest that money if that happens there'll be there'll be other years when they match up very closely\nThere could be other years where your dividends and you're interested in your capital gains a dumped him up to the four percent which you in which case you can liquidate a small a number of shares in order to get to that four percent figure but I think that that should work\nOkay\nI Would say that I'm not sure that ah I liked the idea of putting the traditional\nA tax brokerage account before the raw\nTech ... you know because the money you take from the ... just a gallon his tax free if you follow the rules\nSo I think I'd probably do a slight change there I'd probably priority to prioritize the personal money and then I'd probably use the raw money and then lastly I'd probably use the traditional Monday because that's going to be taxable when you take it out\nOkay I'd reverse the order of those too but I wouldn't actually tap into any of that ah until one of those years when I didn't get four percent by taking interest dividends et cetera\nYeah and and then that ... that's a good way to look at it and uh\nYou mean where you didn't get the four percent from your personal portfolio right that's a very good way to look at it because I'm what you could do then is you could use your lost money as your backup money and you still would not create any tax liability by doing that\nOkay thank you very much for your help\nReady to hear from you built checking in from the show me\nState in ...

Bush the president\nMade a proposal right to to invest a small portion of the Social Security fund in the stock market if that had been done\nThat would have done extremely well because he made that proposal when the stock market was at lower levels much lower levels for a door during his two terms so if they had taken up that idea the place to small portion in the stock market which would have to be indexed\nThen uh that money would have done extremely well unfortunately Congress which can't seem to agree or how many days in the week there are any more they're just in case there simply dysfunctional they're incapable of govern\nWhat maybe there was a condition of talking about is that that money cannot be touch Social Security the time and age and maybe they're concerned that passed laws\nThat money is going to be in touch prior to that that is the risk and the stock market but also this money could be invested and I'm thirty three years or so the U.S government\nUh or twenty five or ... what should be it would give certain uh returns\nWell they all ready invest a lot of the money in it and they already invest the money and the equivalent of us treasuries right now they do that right now\nBut I thought it's all I Do you I thought that\nMoney and all of that uh yeah but that they consider it the equivalent\nBecause that's the rate of interest that earns is the equivalent it ... it it earns the market rate of interest one has invested yes you're yes you're right there's no money there the whole thing is a\n... year right now because you know why because all the money is getting all more and more and eventually all of the money is getting paid out of the the people who are currently working paying Social Security tax and then they take that money and they pay it after the beneficiaries and that's where we're headed\nAnd so the whole thing is a under the unified budget\nThere's no question about it uh this whole concept of a trust fund with money out there yeah it's I always use you're absolutely correct but I don't see any any one first of all I don't see any one politically in Washington stepping up on this issue it's become the third rail of politics and they don't want to touch it they don't want to cut Medicare either\nA in terms of making those fiscally responsible they don't want to go near it on the other hand uh I don't see the votes in Congress to get something done on this because they just are well they're totally dysfunctional and they've proven time and again\nThemselves they prove that themselves\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one it is on the line listening to the mighty WLS Schuchat although it\nHow about this in Chicago I got a a large portion of my money and money markets that are not covered by FDIC and I'm trying to fight a that is a problem the reason that I have the money and money market account\nOr is that\nI'm not sure how long I'm going to live and I don't want to tie up my money you know a like a CD for a longer period of time or or even a shorter period of time so that it would be a a hindrance to my\nEars and I'm Wondering if there would be a problem with keeping it in\nA money market at this point in time\nI think if you're with quality companies companies like the vanguard companies like fidelity any of the high quality companies I can only speak for myself I don't have a problem having money and money market funds because I'm worried about it\nBut I mean you would have to speak for yourself on that issue as to whether you're comfortable with it or there's another way for you to do this which is to just do in the short term treasury bills which can be liquidated the anytime\nOkay\nYou could use for example if you owned Ninety One day treasury bills three month treasury bills\nThan a those monies can be liquidated at any time and they're perfectly safe or and or not only that the interest is exempt from um state and local tax so that's certainly something for you to consider you would not for example you would not have to pay\nOr the Illinois state income tax on interest you earned on a treasury bill so that might be an increased incentive for you to take a look at like ... or something like that and the rates have been increasing as the Federal Reserve continues to increase short term rates\nAnd so that certainly is something else is going on\nAnd I do appreciate the call\nAnd that was an interesting a speech that the fed chair Jerome Powell gave at Jackson Hole Wyoming this week I Hope many of you had an opportunity to uh read parts of it or even more that you've had the chance to go to the ... in Jackson Hole Wyoming\nBut uh there's no question about it that he has made it clear that uh he's going to continue to watch inflation buddies not particularly upset about inflation right now\nAh and he certainly has made it clear that he's going to gradually increase short term interest rates until they get to\nSome level of normal and um he he doesn't seem to be flourishing in any way from the the program that he has set forth which he basically inherited from\nA from a chair Yellen his predecessor which is to gradually increased rates of interest as the economy grows and as employment grows and as inflation remains manageable I think that would be a synopsis of his view\nAnd I think it's a view that's generally accepted at this juncture\nIf you'd like to join us on the toll free line we'd like to hear from you one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that's our number one eight hundred nine

please call this toll free number right now eight hundred\nThey are focusing on the core personal consumption expenditures your index and that has been very very close to the target level established by the Federal Reserve that target level is two percent to point out\nWell it's been like right in the one point nine percent area recently and based on the ah estimates that are out there are some people expect to get up to the two percent level when a when the data is released on the revised gross domestic product\nA this coming week there will be the revised the number one day that there'll be revised number two data coming a month later\nAnd so that's just quarterly data though that's not the import all important in your your number so when we take a look\nAt the fed policy\nWe have to consider okay they're raising rates okay they're throwing debt onto the market in the form of the corner the tightening program as they remove it from their balance sheet and very large numbers\nTrillions actually over time and so all of these factors come into play and that's why it's really important what the fed chair says about\nWhat's going on with inflation and what he's saying right now is he is not\nEspecially exercised about the rate of inflation that's because he's focusing on the fact that we've had this personal consumption expenditures core inflation right in that one point nine percent area perhaps to go to ... percent soon well he's OK with that because that\nWas the level that the federal open market committee established as its target back when figures were lower now the reason and this comes up all the time the reason they don't want to go below two percent\nIs because they really fear deflation\nIn the eyes of the fed one of the worst things are going to happen is deflation because when you get deflation than the opposite of inflation happens what happens with inflation was inflation you're paying back your debt with\nDepreciated money and networks in your favor against your debt payment\nThat applies both to the interest and the principal with deflation you're paying back your debts and increasing cost because the value of your money is going

we're going to Truckee, California Leanne welcome them when they talk\nAbout I appreciate your taking my call\nI had a question for you if I could and it has to do with model portfolio number three I have it through vanguard and I was looking after that they they had more money at the bond sight of that and it looks like I don't know if I'm allowed to many of the ... and that are not\nWell or one or two just asked me your your question a generic form\nOkay sounds good on one of them it looks like when I look it up last week at vanguard and I was looking at the year to date ill and so if I take that and ... kind of take it through the end it here and that was actually adjusted return it looks like I'd be better off going into the\nPrime money market rather than going into that and then the second part of that question was ... ... S C I F ... what ... what did that have to do with the annual return how does that relate\nWell they're all they're all love figure differently and uh so\nYou know if as long as you're consistent I think that's probably the most important part of it as long as you're consistent with how you're doing it but\nUh it depends which one you're looking at and ah it can be very complicated or known how these deals are constructed because you have current yield you have the maturity of as easy of distribution deal I mean it just goes on and on but I Would say as far as the money market fund component of that particular portfolio\nThe yield on that right now is over two percent\nAnd I think for someone that just wants to have a very very simplified portfolio as I've said before you can use that money market fund or you can use a C. D. ladder\nNow if you're going to use the CD ladder is an alternate or you could use for example equal amounts of the three six and nine and twelve month CD\nAnd by doing that you'd have a very short average duration you know our average duration in a portfolio is less than one year your average duration on a three six nine twelve months CGI would be even less than a than the one that's in the portfolio which is already over one year\nAnd that would be another way that you could look at it in other words there are various ways in a rising interest rate environment that you can go depends on how a wrist wrist tolerant you are if you're not risk tolerated at all\nThen to see the letter fully FDIC insured is risk free it's held the majority and that certainly is something to consider as well and that money market fund is also something to consider and we've\nIncluded that as part of the portfolio let's get out to the great cayenne us radio Denver lawn it is your turn ...\nFacts five as for as for the time I waited for your ...\nThank you for hold on I Do appreciate your patience thinking\nIf I have two daughters my a fourteen year old I Need to do a college five twenty nine plan for\nAnd I have a hundred thousand set aside for that I'd like to know what would make up for lost time what would be the highest return a college but I've heard I I Would recommend it then I have a twenty eight year old who she just finished her medical school and\nI'd like to I heard in the long term IRA find which would you prefer\nWell I think that uh for the twenty eight year old certainly getting started a I Would look at something or with broad diversification and low expenses\nI Would recommend or that you consider starting with something like either the or fidelity sport in total stock market index for the then go total stock market index they both have extremely low expense ratio is\nA minimal I Would consider the minimal not significant and they give you a broad diversification they give you tax efficiency so I think the total stock market index that either one of those out this would be a good place to start thank you\nThat's the only eight year old for the fourteen year old where it's a little dicey because you're going to be writing college tuition checks in about four years so you have to be a aware of that as well\nAnd so uh I think I Want to have some diversity in that portfolio and by that I mean I Want to have some liquid assets some liquidity I mean in that portfolio\nOr at least by the time we get to the point where we're writing commissioned checked we can't make for your work and so in the market at least I Can't I don't have a four year forecast on the market\nUh so uh you know you have to consider is if you made a four year forecast on the market in Nineteen Ninety eight it probably would not have been they ask to be five hundred being an eight hundred right because it was in the mid teens there when we got around year two thousand\nSo making a four year for kids do more of the market's going to be is is a ... activity but uh certainly I think at this point you have some time here\nYou don't have to file you return to the next year but you may have to make estimated payments depending on how large numbers are that's between you and your accountant or your enrolled agent or a CPA but whatever I think bottom line here you might have some tax liability and I think if you do take three hundred and fifty out\nI think you will have some tax liability 'cause your money has a well more than doubled while you've added in there and by the way even taking the average cost in most of your cost is going to be based on your initial expense of approximately seven hundred thousand dollars\nSo I I wouldn't I Would ask you to go through all of that as far as the other a part of it going into the total market no I Would not do that\nOkay how are you mentioned short short duration bonds bond\nFund yeah yeah and you know if you don't want to if you don't want to do that there's a really simple way for you to do it you can do a a a letter of\nThe three six nine twelve months CDs equal amounts in that case you could spread it out roughly close to Ninety thousand and three months six months nine months twelve month when the three month comes through your role with into a twelve month that keeps your three six nine twelve sequence intact\nYou're fully FDIC insured when you do this I wouldn't do it any other way fully FDIC insured\nAnd uh that way you're not taking any risk with the money because you have FDIC behind you and because it's held the maturity you're guaranteed by the FDIC to get back your principal and interest uh as long as you're under the insured amount so that's the approach you could take\nNo I Would not be going out into some intermediate term duration bond fund because I I think that the\nUh I personally think it's not a good thing to be doing it this time I'm not doing it I'm not recommending it and that's why I Would rather be in the shorter to ration\nThis money talk [noise]\nMoney Chong [noise]\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them

border to border and ... and ... ... let's get out to Portland, Oregon Larry welcome\nThe money yes Bob I'm retired Seventy years old and and a longtime subscriber and I'm concerned about with like everyone else with wise in interest rate and what is going to be doing to the bond\nA bond fund a and a oh you're going to be a return in additional fun too I guess as alternative to what you have in their portfolio or\nWell we really have presented three possibilities to to invest in depending on the tolerance for risk and I\nI mean we're we're always open to new ideas but frankly I think right now with the three options that we have I think we're in good shape well now we're dealing with this and either we're going to see a rise in\nIn the longer term rates or we're running an increasing risk of an inverted yield curve that that does not happen\nUh we're getting we're getting fairly close to a catch twenty two year\nWere either we have to see an increase in long term rates which many people don't want to see or we run the risk gift that keeps jacking up the federal funds rate that we could get into an area of an inverted yield curve down the road if the long rates uh don't appreciate\nSo it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out but it's going to take some time because right now there's a a decent gap\nBetween the federal funds rate and the ten year treasury rate but right now in addition to the portfolio that we publish\nOr in the investment his letter or a fixed income which as an average duration will Bush in one year\nIn addition to that we have two other avenues that we can go down depending on a personal preference\nOne I just mentioned that the caller is the um the CD ladder of the nice thing about the CD ladder is that uh you minimize your interest rate risk because you every three months you have a C. D. maturing to reinvest that the current rate\nAnd if you take a portfolio and you said it into four pieces three six nine twelve months CDs with FDIC coverage\nThan you're a you're rolling on that basis you don't have any credit risk because you have yet the icy and you don't have much interest rate risk at all because you're constantly every three months you're rolling into a new CD it prevailing rates\nAnd another area there's some people choose to go which is fine very convenient is something like that on guard prime money market you're getting your current your right now in excess of two percent or you can even get check writing with that\nYou have total It's Wednesday there and a check writing to go as well with the tricks of two fifty or more so plenty kind of a smorgasbord out there to try to avoid the risk of rising rates I don't see any point in going long term in the bond market at this juncture\nMore to come stay with us if you can buffer eager here it's the flight of the starship money [noise]\n\n[laughter] Sunday October ... what's new today on the free our radio a radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the theory mood how Republicans might be ... you'll tracks with labor is why why we've\nEveryone's talking about like the famous people were bowlers fog Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\n\nShift so ...

crisis began to be created by ... by journalists by economists\nAnd I felt at some point that this was a really interesting kind of test case to show students are all sorts of different disciplines in fact how history is get created and\nHaving set myself to kind of read and study all the other people who bought and watching these histories of the crisis it felt I needed to kind of political together and the ... like this\nOne of the things is always fascinating fascinated me about the financial crisis is the fact that I'm In march of two thousand pages you will know Bear Stearns ... a gotten a lot of trouble and a wound up being bailed out in the end I'm\nWith the help the Federal Reserve and I'm with the help of the major bank um one of the things has always struck me is that uh I mean that was a really big deal that was a real shock wave for\nFor Wall Street and for the Federal Reserve\nAnd uh and yet it really didn't serve the\nThe value of that warning shots across the bow so relatively soon in March of two thousand and they didn't really\nAccomplish what it should have accomplished because All right they bailed them out and things move forward and and then things still

H. O. radio in Des Moines Dan you're on the line with Adam go ahead\nYes I Am completely\nBeen amazed for a path basically one of the year two thousand and how powerful modern communication Finley crates\nDeflation or a pressure on pricing by price discovery I see it all the time on TV I see it all the time on on on social media Twitter Facebook\nAmazon these are all mechanisms that are driving the price of that act like they're stuck on the twentieth century they act like they don't know what the Internet really is when it comes to price perceptions election\nAnd are and how it the flights continuously while they can they scream inflation\nLike no they're they're more ours facing roof over his art got life pensions Hulu from their level so I I Can't believe nobody calls them out on it\n\nI got this was a this was the topic at the Jackson Hole meeting this year the the the deflation repression from the Internet economy is obviously very real of this is the incredible long upswing that we've had since two thousand nine to exaggerate\nIt will ... in many ways quite disappointing but what's really remarkable about is how little inflation repression there is in the system you see that on the wage side as well so\nI agree with you as being a qualitative shift in the world economy in the last Twenty years\nInternet is part of that story which are emphasizing but I also think you have to factor in this of course he's into connected with the into that story the role of the the Chinese economy is a great manufacturing hub which has systematically pressed\nThe cost of production down around the world so this is I think that changing the game in terms of monetary policy\nAnd yet professor there is a an intrinsic irony here that we would even for a moment the thinking gee I Wish there was more inflation\n[noise] yeah well that's that's true ... on the other hand deflation is a very bad thing from the point of view of the credit driven economy and we have to look at Japan to see how to build a tightening that can be if it really sets into the system\nI Will say from the point of view of handling you know an ever expanding volume of government debt\nIf you look back historically the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen sixties when economies lied to us in the u._k. with dealing with the debts accumulates during World War two\nThey were paid back by very high levels of taxation they were paid by by high levels of growth but\nA key element in the story was also inflation running somewhat ahead of interest rates and that a is a sense of the attacks on money values or which helps to distribute the cost of paying for the war in that case paying for World War two\nAcross the entire population even though he's holding assets say managing and economies with structurally love inflation and in fact a tendency towards the ... is a really difficult thing to do and it's actually ... novel it's a new problem in Japan is not exactly a promising example of how things might go\nAgainst in is Adam Tuesday Columbia University whose new book is crashed we talk on the program um\nWe talk on the program at all about the fact that you will know that\nAre in a credit driven economy inflation is your friend in the sense that you're getting back your principal and appreciating dollars you're paying back your interest the depreciating dollars you know just ... just briefly could you help our listeners understand a\nWhy the place in in a credit driven economy is so painful in terms of what it does to Europe for example outstanding debt\nYeah I think the best way to look at this is the housing market I think that's where most of us understand this nice intimately and you take out a mortgage on the property at one of the basic questions you've got to ... when you\n\nGo up and almost all the details of done on the basis that at least the ... the house will retain its value will probably appreciate to some moderate or perhaps great extent if you're buying in San Francisco well Manhattan also my life that\nI mean and taught basis of a deal this was true will say for the subprime fails the full two thousand tonight is that you'll have a real price appreciation now you have the reverse is if you have a sudden price poll just the prospect of a long running sustained folding prices\nThat hits you'll equity and of course it does absolutely nothing to the debt that you owe the mortgage doesn't adjust downloads so in an upswing the price increase\nProvides a huge benefit to leverage to investors who has to take it out to mortgage with a small amounts of equity they gain all the profit from the appreciation the reverse happens when you guys with deflation situation\nI think insofar as the vast majority of people have most of the equity most of their assets most of their wealth in the real estate\nI don't miss the old and a very large part of that at least is leverage three mortgages to find yourself in the situation with prices falling is really a death now for\nFor households for ...\nYeah and then assemble model one hundred thousand dollar property where you put twenty thousand dollars down at that at that property declines in price by ten thousand you've lost heavier equity", "show_name": "Money Talk with Bob Brinker", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "14", "locations": [["Fayetteville", 36.06258, -94.15743],
