[{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "These you know the now they're really just trying to take the fun out of Halloween if you can't wear sexy costumes and you can appropriate cultures what the heck is Halloween for as an adult at least and for kids I Would note you know it maybe it's a good lesson in a sense because you end up\nRealizing that you don't really want to eat candy all the time you know you don't really want to be in a position where you're just constantly ... on racist pieces you will reach a saturation a saturation point for reaches pieces\nYou will find yourself at some point do have eaten all the M. and M. and m's the most the most popular candy in the world\nThat's right ... number one it was a random aside I almost a started\nWorking when I was waiting to go to the CIA I got a I've got a job\nOffer at a I forget which I don't remember what it's called out but some big advertising company and they wanted me to work on candy and I'm pretty sure it was the Mars account which is a M. and m's so I Would have been peddling M. and m's all over the world and most of the CIA take me thank thank God that did\nAh but yeah you read all that Kenny realized you don't want to eat that much candy as a kid you know nobody really wants to eat that much candy I mean you just reaches level where you're like I've had enough I don't really need to do this anymore and that\nSo you learn that as a kid and that but that as an adult as a guy you know you\nYou get to be a rather than women tend to dress some women some without a lawyer like buck I dress like a um I dress like a witch and not a naughty which put a scary one they do whatever that's that's cool but\nSome college age and and ... and older young women tend to dress in\nMore provocative fashion so Gonzaga is worried about this and also is a reminder for me the cultural appropriation which has gotten all this attention right now or the or the holiday season cultural appropriation is not a thing\nI it's not even that I disagree with cultural appropriation is that there is no such thing as cultural appropriate it's not even possible it's not something you couldn't do because culture doesn't belong to anyone or any group\nCulture is just a way that things are done a ... way of um either eating or dressing or speaking or any number of things\nAnd any human being can adopt any culture that they want that's just the nature of and in fact all cultures in a constant state\nOf appropriation and evolution and the only way that culture of all just by having other influences that affected so there's no such thing as a static culture therefore you can't be stealing someone's culture you can only be part of the general cultural ... most is\nLike that for a lot of fun fun word there that everybody else is engaged it as well\nBut now I also remember some of my my\nBest and worst costumes over the years John do you ever do you have a a costume that you're either very embarrassed about are very proud of\nDon't be showing don't I don't think I've ever dressed up\nAs an adult would dress up for Halloween as an adult now but I oh I see\nHow it is I see your call me out now I see what's out there is producer Mike is he going is he talking to a naughty nurse right now are sea within earshot of the microphone\nI think he's talking to a naughty secretary over somewhere that that sounds that sounds about\nRight or you know every every time I think that we could get we can catch Mike on the Mike is he's out getting phone numbers um but I and I could tell you my best costume ever was actually when I was a young adults in my early twenties in DC I found a theater supply store so I got invited to a big fancy Halloween party\nAnd I I uh theater supply store and they let me read because you want to get really high in costume and not spend a lot of money got rent it and I rented a full on theatrical production costume slash kind of\nUniform replica of general Douglas MacArthur I mean with like the ... and a pipe and the sunglasses and the whole thing man that costume was legit by the way tend to lose\nBe surprised how much attention to the ladies give to a guy walks around wearing wearing the ... so that was a very good costume I dressed up as Bjorn Borg one year or with the kind of a you know the seventies style tennis out fix I just basically\nShrank a a shirt and a lot in the in the drier by accident and I had a head band than an hour wouldn't tennis racket\nSo that worked out so I don't I don't have any fantastic costumes I'm not somebody who\nIs is quite as up on on their costume game as many others but I Hope if you do go out this weekend\nAppropriate all the culture you want and if you want to or not it costs you guys or girls ... ladies and gentlemen by all means that is that is you're right because darn it this is America a but obviously you know be safe don't don't eat too much candy corn and don't drink too much\nSpiked a trauma candy corn pumpkin juice to ... candy corn roster cheat as your ... you know this site and somebody might finally appears some ask somebody what ... what is your what is your best or worst or both Halloween costume and you can remember\nI was never a huge Halloween guy I mean the ... but other than it thought I didn't get too much into it but one year it was actually a watch my buddies and friends did a group thing and we did the ah\nAddams family and uh I was ... Adams I'm\nAnd that was fun actually 'cause there was like seven or eight of us and at the individual people were like ... who are you like what are you doing and then but then when he got altogether it was like you guys are awesome\nSo that was a sort of on\nNice Halloween parties\nThat ... I Know I'm more right\nFair enough you know and I will eat candy and I will give out the candy but er what is the best Halloween candy\nGood question I mean I I'm a I have a huge sweet to so I don't ... I go to resist visas for me like if I'm if I'm able to just pick any candy I think Greece's pieces is yeah it was pretty spectacular ... considered\nI'm a we actually got into this conversation after the other day I'm ... I'd like to freeze some of my candy and I think when you go frozen the Milky Way it doesn't get a whole lot better than that in my opinion\nWow yeah I I had not thought of that I Do know that ... for all those listening\nIf you ever like make brownies and you don't want to eat them all at once and you keep it in the freezer and then you want to put them in the microwave the you'd do maintain freshness baked goods frozen is actually a very smart thing to do yeah\nI didn't learn until like a couple of years ago and it's apparently they didn't they didn't teach us that in CIA school [laughter] so ah anyway All right yeah good good good times producer my concerns were going to come back we got our buddy Benny\nJohnson in the mix and then we've got a Stephanie\nHamilton kind of like a double dose of the Daily Caller this Friday on the show\nAnd you know before I actually did a sit down I did the federalist radio hour which the podcast today [noise] with Mollie Hemingway who's just just so cool she's great so good on on Fox so a lot of content that they oh by the way I'll be on ... show tonight at eleven pm eastern\nSo talking about all the stuff bringing all the truth of wild stuff [noise] and uh I'll be back in just [noise] the FBI calls home\nBut also have to one of the fastest growing crimes my friend's brace yourself if you've ever had your credit card stone it's nothing compared to the hell you're in for when the steals your homes title everything's online these days including your home settled domestic and international thieves\nHunt American homeowners because we have equity in our homes and the bad guys are stealing it may take you off your homes title an add an alias than they borrow hundreds of thousands using your homes equity and stick you with the payments you won't know until you get a late payment notice\nIdentity theft programs and insurance policies don't protect you\nHome title walk safeguards your homes title from cyber thieves and hackers by putting an online perimeter around your homes title\nThe instant detects on tampering with their own it to shut it down for pennies today home town of law protects my most valuable asset my family's home you needed to register for a free now says you have your homes title has been compromised it's a hundred dollar value free visit home titled rock dot com\nOr in college or in a row Super Bowl champions aren't the most important contract of his life to serve in the Army National guard\nOr a lot of military my friend was for for what's all my family's overall I Want to go out there make a difference and find the working behind the desk so familiar in ... minutes from our country was hard for them\nTo learn how to be part of the Army National guard logged on to the national guard dot com sponsored by the Colorado Army National guard\nBroadcasters association of this station Casey\nColorado's dependable accurate ballots [noise]\nFive Ninety ...\nThree open community um floating in the mid term elections because no every boat make that my opinion matters or vote I vote\nIn the mid term election to register to vote go to I Am a voter dot com and don't forget to vote Tuesday November sixth sponsored by her immediate and acidic culture coalition\nYeah and I think that ah people are starting to have second thoughts about whether or not he should run for president that strikes me as not the best move\nUh no not the best movie you've happy my question was that the un and the name of the\nMajor cheerleader from an ID or you have people at CNN or making sure that ah his name is starting to move down and the DNC a presidential candidate less or he is a Christian was said maybe it's time for us to rethink like body as being the front let her\n\nKnow I I got on how's it going to have you been ... Halloween Halloween is a holiday that some of us think\nOf as um you know for kids where do you come down on this issue\nOr it's not a hunting for kids\nIs it a holiday for kids should adults dress up I'm going to be getting into a whole sexy costume conversation coming up in a few minutes and then you know where you come down on this issue should adults we dressing up for Halloween\n[laughter] ah well I mean\nJess ... there's been a major issues in the new fight we problematic ... I think Megan Kelly had a part of this week about a\nEssentially defending it must be defending black me I don't want to do but she just doesn't have a job anymore she has six nine million dollars and our bank account oh that's great if I may Michael I guess it's be fired by NBC and to get Seventy million dollars or so um\nBut yeah I I don't I don't remember the problem here are dressed up as Brett Kavanaugh for Halloween and I'm going to wear a I've got just outfit and I'm Out of gas or an imam sign around my neck and says I like beer\nAnd and that's going to be like Oscar\nI I don't I don't really understand why a what would be you know what would be problematic for this or advocate or an adult\nNow on the Megan Kelly thing ... you should do or show back in the day at Fox I feel like you probably were in the mix for\nThat um she was the first person that ever ... ever put me on prime time at Fox oh I said yesterday that I feel like I have some you know as\nI have a certain fondness for Megan but then again I think she made ... incredibly bad decisions when it comes to leave it how she left Fox wins you love box where she went from Fox but to me it couldn't be more obvious they just wanted to get rid of her I mean this was really the ... what you said really wasn't like fire rubble offense\nWell no on the fence I mean this is sort of what happens in the media is I think that\nNBC ... looking for an excuse to get rid of backing Kelly rating for taking a she wasn't fitting into the network and I think they just is is that the number one opportunity I say there was a major that was a major conflict\n... this is the same that work but kept Matt Lauer around for decades and this is the thing that work that wouldn't want Ronan Farrow to public reporting on R B once seen on our website so this is a huge double standard\nYeah and and I I gotta say this is where we'll also see the one of one of my maxims is that the less takes care of its own where you can get terminated or on the left unless you were actually unknown predator or something really\nTerrible you know you're actually doing something that's border line up to and including the criminal or you can\nHave a second act I mean you've already seen who's the guy who ah the comedian Louis sea caves coming like these other people\nI think men Kelly's done I I don't think that you know may maybe she'll be a you know selling slow cooker is only the home shopping network or something but I don't think any major networks going to give her another shock because there's only one place where to go and she left\nThe Megan Kelly in a like infomercial for a you know to ... stay cookers would be amazing yes ah that yeah that would that would be that would be absolutely amazing but you're exactly right I mean who's going to figure out I I have no idea I I I just live on fire all of her credentials with conservatives\nAnd the concern was really loved her over ... bc\nAnd then the people that you see the left at NBC they didn't like her and the first place so they ... both sides on fire so where does she go from here and she's not going back to Fox\nAh and I\nYou know and I don't think anyone else is going to see the investment of studying million dollars are really being a meaningful or worthwhile investment because she didn't never delivered on reading\nAnd and and what university were Seventy million dollars by the way I mean ... whose idea we have\nI don't know that we're ... interview remember that that was a big break out she went and interviewed ... and\nIt doesn't even speak English how much of an interview to that really be let's get serious ... second she can't even communicate with him\nEveryone criticized driving up and down for what you are for firing for the sex and feel for everything uh it just didn't work out\nAll right for Kelly that'd be the ... and ... on the ticket disaster or the leading Fox was a huge huge issue and people that are you just got to know that there are a long time ago\nYep that is true Benny Johnson everybody follow him on Twitter his Twitter account was amazing also go to a Daily Caller to see his latest over there which

Sexton parents coming down to Washington DC this weekend they have spent very little time\nIn the swarm I I'd be willing to bet my parents probably have an overnight it in DC in Twenty years so it'll be falling to show them around a little bit and uh you know see what they think of\nThis funky little town that is our nation's capital it'd be a lot of farmers to eat a lot of good food and have some

really clear on exactly what you're asking me here buddy but I Do appreciate the ... note thank you very much\nRe Wright's book since it is technically invasion can Trump declared the border a war zone and limit media access so they can't use the pictures of the poor women and children just wandering thanks\nRay I don't think that\n[noise] well you know I think that maybe he could declared a national emergency but I don't think he'd be able to court a war zone practically as we know only Congress can declare war but here's where things get interesting\nBecause I explained to you that in terms of what the law is now and we're Congress actually is on this issue of the border and immigration\nThey can claim of this caravan can claim asylum and there was nothing to stop them necessarily from that\nBut the president as we know from the whole kerfuffle over the Muslim ban does have the ability to declare any group of aliens to be a problem for national security purposes and to borrow them entry to the United states\nTherefore the president put under his national security authority as the commander in chief and this is in congressional statute right now the president could say you're not allowed to come into this country because you were a national security threat on the commander in chief that's just the way that it is this though\nWould be challenged immediately in the courts the press would completely freak out on on this whole situation as you can imagine\nAnd a ... I'm not sure how it would even be resolved but I Do think that that just war gaming us out a little bit that could happen as a keeping the press away I'm not comfortable with trying to prevent the media from seeing something that's actually going on so I I Would not want that\nTo happen um I don't I don't I think the media should be\nAble to report on what's going on in war zone or the media should be able to report on pretty much anything that's happening here with the possible exception of things that are a him in a national security risk you know troop movements in a like a aries\n... Glenn Beck have access to your Facebook account because it seems like his monologues or an exact copy of of what I wrote you\nUm well uh aries I've I've got to take a look I don't know um I haven't actually talked to go on it a little while I mean I Know that when sorry I Know they're going to have access to my Facebook account\nWhen I met was I don't know what the lens monologues have been recently so I'll have to take a peek at that and\nI'm sure areas you're very wise men and a Glenn is a very talented entertainer so it wouldn't surprise me if you guys had some some share thoughts but I ...

healthy love for freedom and our constitutional republic lately I think Republicans fears of felons voting is misplaced this is purely anecdotal but all the possible lip voters I encountered in prison probably wouldn't go to uphold their lives depended on it and not very impressive people that's kinda where they send us keep up the good fight shields I in Georgia\nMatt Matt\n... really interesting to hear from a man I appreciate getting a perspective from somebody who has a serve\nTime for a felony and can speak to what it's like being a prisoner and also what a what the\nPolitical vibe is on

charged with something potentially explosive packages to leading Democrats President Trump calling for a change in the rhetoric\nIn recent days we've had a broader conversation about the tone and civility of our\nAnd he said it was you know really made is made out of great ingenuity but he said that he will hardly think I shall meet the test its power disclosed the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into this into the community of the spiritual movement and also it in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the ... board that we know today got his start in Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point\nSo there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada\nLots of rights from the United states to sell their own version of the wage aboard and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two and the rest is history and so bored such as Bob sport which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the wage what makes it a prominent splash into the market I mean everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this has been a spiritual moving with going big time and\nI was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat board and started doing different types of their own type a\nBoard and of course we ... the trademark tens of the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspect\nSerial killer or making a board ah basically it's ... it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he would feel right about himself or what have you ah in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned people didn't act around and start customizing selling them\nUm but the degree of this type of story no I never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money ... there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nI'm In its I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really whether or not\nYeah we we don't know if he did he checked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know that's that's the that's the thing is the avoided\nA any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so do they take it seriously\n[noise] well it's just kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling\nOn on on would just put the color a Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for current affair which is an old TV show or on a which has only channel five or something right in the east and um\nHe was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated like um show heated like producing I think mhm current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level I think it's the same image to same exact\nYou know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYou know in the in the background to write the background history\nYes and they were told and everything you know and they put it down\nSo they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but um it's the same story and it's a very and I tell people you know not to and I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old\nBecause this is real this is really happen this really works and it's very scary\nAnd if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody would call go to the same place at the end but says some bad that people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to send them back\nSo I always say that it's not a joke ...\nNo I'm In I'm going to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use the board in a long time was beyond as ... used to board\nA gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they use it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use them and you know boards rudimentary like that even even when you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights\nSo that her little boy you can go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really don't need boards do we care and I mean even the boards there or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into naval due to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own\nSix cents ... he started developing really started really being fine tune\nAnd taken about the way I can still do this work and be a lot of people is in the old days these typewriters [laughter] word processors now they use computer keyboards and the channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board the people at the tactile experience and the movement\nMovement itself that kind of opens up the receptor seek to start bringing in the information right and so again I might be required to board does know negative energy with any boy that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home so then I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen unless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that my desire or that's how I view the world so\nPeople doesn't mean you know people in these scaring us even talking about this on the radio while I have\nAre though they they they think in the they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and they don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and now it's ... motor responses are that are basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions and the mind that come from the unconscious\nIf it's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body in the brain are big transmitters\nAnd so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the board as you say is like a permission slip in a way to to view I mean people would use pencils that I I used to know a medium that would ah would he would do his thing he would just scribble he would\nTake the pencil and he would just scribble on a new bad and he just scribbling scribbling as these scribbling for some reason they just doing the scribble he's looking at this go on all I see a scribbling but what I used to what he saw it was something else and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of\nI don't know doing something with his hands on his mind was bringing in the information from getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are using something else but it certainly is there to have the mind generate or push through the body the city of motor response but certainly is a interesting and you see it in an action tonight on grounds that we're talking about Bob's warrior care and\nA dominant program who is the director of the talking more Historical Society and seen are all over and she's been a guy or a guy who showed beyond belief she's been a

lot to really tell me and you know she's a she's a frequent guest you're in but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what\nHappens to the body after he died called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked to she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she just love it you know she's great\nAnd you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into these subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students should be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nFew huh [laughter] well\nFirst of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I walked Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... one of the book and there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works

minimum destabilization\nAnd that's you know that's something that I think is a you know meet needs to be remembered here I I think Lindsey Graham is look I\nGive him a lot of credit for the whole capital thing but as much as I'd like to just look at that and say it's all fine now they're gonna get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this deal and the deal is going to be

earlier sponsored by the Colorado army now and I have no right or banning of the\nLaughable argument I mean the notion that Elizabeth Warren is a Cherokee or could consider herself a Native

from a person of color as anyone could possibly be\nAnd yet she still kinda ... she used to she still clings to it but then there was just wondering well did she receive any benefit my friends there is\nSo much circumstantial evidence that she received benefit that it is also laughable to suggest that that she did not\nUm that she did not have the ... and I'm not somebody who's a school snob but she did not have the academic pedigree for law school do then going to be a professor at the University of Pennsylvania an Ivy League school and Harvard\nConsidered to be the number one school and and really the number one law school in the United states no way that happens in last the hiring\nCommittees thinks that they can while they can but it's very important them when they put out these reports very important that they have a Native American on the faculty that's a big big deal for them they have their\nPick they can have anyone they want and that's why I also why would Elizabeth Warren list herself as such\nIt must have gave her some benefit it's a bizarre thing to do unless you are gaming the system the only reason you would do that if you were Elizabeth Warren and clearly not a person of color would be to game the system so it just defies belief it's completely ridiculous I can\nTell you that I spoke to 'cause I have access to a lot of Democrats up the hill\nOr and I spoke to Democrats today who our colleagues and I got to say there were all there were all say it\nTo this is just there's no excuse there's nothing you can say about it that she thought that this proved your case was completely insane a Donald Trump also\nWe had one more trade on this he rewrote thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is a complete and total from [laughter] sometimes referred to as Pocahontas\nHe has defeated really the progressive front runner for twenty twenty before she was even able to get into the race officially\nAnd he defeated or by getting inside her head and forcing her to make one of the great unforeseen political errors of all time I have never seen anything quite like this uh this ... this is truly truly astonishing\nBut then the president had this thing today later on that I got to say I don't know what's going on here I Want the president focused on what matters and I want the president\nOn policy amok fighting back absolutely but what is this thing about\nWhat is this thing about a ... horse Oh yes here's what he wrote federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to a legal fees\nGreat now I can go after a horse race and her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total calm\nYou know it's interesting Trump really hold out here that that this is a lie start to finish and I have thought\nThat ah that that there is no way that she's lying about Trump just because of the detail and they look they do know each other they have had contact it's not like the\nKavanaugh allegation and wanted nothing because there's nothing criminal about anything that even alleged about Trump with Stormy Daniels ah or I should say about his contact with her and people are saying was all the campaign finance that's pathetic that no no shot no chance um\nBut I got to say now I'm thinking you know is it is it ... why why do people jumped to the conclusion that Trump actually has had this affair with her\nUm what what I said I shouldn't say jumping conclusion I think that's obvious but why are we so sure\nA lot of people in those seem very brochure about it I I'm I'm just I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been any proof offered that I'm aware of\nMeaning she's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair she just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this\nHer whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ... and degrading and nasty\nToward toward the president so I'm you know I I had thought that the president this was before he was the president I have thought that maybe he and you know had strayed from his marital out here and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action in their lives um bad\nEspecially because it's you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they won't enforce it against Democrat but there's also part of me the things well you know\nMaybe there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they're all focused on the president referring to a woman as a horse race\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week in this feels a little bit like a field a little bit like an unnecessary distraction and and not something that I Would really want the president to say buttons that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're this ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle or maybe they're just going to be these you know is it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all going to be great\nSo that that's a part of it too and maybe he's human which we all know who he is maybe he's imperfect which we all know he is a and I I think that we should be able to have that chalk\nAre among those of us who really support the president and his agenda which I clearly do and still we want to say okay I kinda wish you hadn't called some woman horse race on Twitter I just I think that that's yeah that's a little\nThat's a little bit beneath where where presidents or B that said he's been crushing everything else all week and been amazing so you know so he's not perfect it's pretty darn good though so you know I'll give it to him on that and that's I I think that's an okay standard to have for politicians you know is not perfect me pretty darn good\nIt really is um and I I've seen recently some some conservatives that things start to come around to this notion of why do we have to why don't we have to pretend like any politicians perfect\nWhy do we have to pretend like anyone is is beyond or not just pretend but hold them up to this standard of of moral pro bitty that isn't there for anybody else really in public life\nLook Trump is made more mistakes than a lot of other folks in that area but he's also clearly got a gift for politics for entertainment and he is he is the man for this era\nOr Elizabeth Warren let ... let me tell you why I said let me tell you why I say that instead of just staying in our ... let me break that down a little bit wider here's a perfect example of why I give Trump a lot of leeway why I cut this president a lot of slack\nOn some of the tweets are some of the stuff he says about you know people here or there that I feel like maybe ... is going a little far here's why\nIf it weren't for someone like Donald Trump if we had a Mitt Romney instead of Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren was going to be twenty twenty candidate it would just be him getting attacked all the time our guy getting attacked not fighting back and Elizabeth Warren getting away with being a huge fraud\nWho advocates for all kinds of class warfare while she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year as a she was at a tenured professor at Harvard law school I think a quarter of a million dollars a year he's making plenty of money she's got plenty of money\nUm and and all of that false miss all that fall so that she's out they're peddling to people would really go unchallenged than a meaningful way and the worst of all if she were to win the presidency against a Romney like figure\nYou and I would have a harder time\nPutting food on the table paying our mortgages or in my case rent you know paying bills taking care of family taking care of medical bills would all be harder because of Elizabeth Warren because she has wrong ideas because she's self involves because she doesn't\nUnderstand the way the world really works and because she's benefited from this system\nThe system in place that the left holds up at all costs of some people you know get a get special privileges some people will get pushed through now and and others are told well you have some form of privilege so you have to just suffer in silence I'm Sorry\nAt Trump has saved us from yet another progressive\nDestruction machine this case would've been Elizabeth Warren's while I'm laughing about the whole thing he's also don't the nation a great service by making sure that Elizabeth Warren focus hunters does not become president on the radio on\nIf I died yesterday dot [noise]\n\nThis wave of a just a a restoration of concern or the restoration of concern for our financial future for just so many um so many things that all of a sudden we're at the top of the list right\nAnd and also restoration of the American founding as as a topic of conversation\nI I'm just saying we're we're not we have not done anything about this yet and we've had a Republican House Republican Congress I'm Sorry what was the Senate and White House now for almost two years\nAnd we haven't taken action and I worry that we're not going to take action I worry that this is June going to become\nOne of these issues where are we all talk of big game we all talked talked tough on this\nBut at the end of the day nobody wants to be the one that says that we got to spend less Republicans will talk about okay we can't tax more fine but the truth is we've got to spend less and that means we're going to spend less on Social Security and Medicaid or Medicare Medicaid\nThat's what it means that is what it means or else it it has no meaning and Republicans don't want to hear that and I know a lot of the folks listening to this than I have a tough time with that they feel like they paid in and so it's not\nAn entitlement at the government you know making amends for taking money from them for all those years Social Security is pretty much true we just need to change the structure of a long term Medicare it's not true with Medicare your kids if you're listening to this really actually your grandkids if your Medicare age they're the ones and your great grandkids\nAre going to be paying the financial price for the care that people take it out of the system today\nIt's not right it's intergenerational theft and I know people don't want to hear it but that's just the truth\nMeanwhile the feds collected record income taxes in twenty Eighteen so you know we're always told oh there's not enough there was not enough or you know revenue there's not revenue which there's too much more than a revenue there's too much spending\nGovernment has got to rein it in and in less were you know we're\nEither going to have a serious national conversation about this and take action we're going to suffer some really horrific economic consequences and by the time the consequences are obvious it's going to be tough to turn it around and that's just the truth\nI I'm a look we'll continue to talk about this issue because it matters but I I won't hormone or too much fucking Ron Paul did it for a little bit that was interesting he served as a big lead ...

year old boy twelve year old anybody um that's not cool it's not nice it's not fair and it's a on becoming\nSo I'm not commenting on a twelve year old\nAs somebody with strong opinions and who goes

seems to think that it is not just normal but expected for a twelve year old to be quote an act of asked\nKids should be allowed to be kids and the only way that a a normal child would feel the need to come home and cry\nBecause that young girl met another girl who did not show described as a feminist\nIs because the parents are engaging in a really relentless propaganda campaign toward their own children now parents can raise kids with whatever believes they want but I I Would just note that\nI think that they're doing a disservice I think that anyone does a disservice to a very young person by ... really instilling in um a radical leftist belief\nAnd not letting them keep an open minded and develop their their own beliefs but I also think that increasingly parents these days and just adults in general in America who our lives who are liberals have absolutely no perspective on these issues they they have no ability\nTo stand back and try to be a little objective their purpose other kids and you know letting their kids\nCome to their own beliefs and not feel familial pressure to take certain positions because even as an adult you should always be testing and retesting your

I I I blame will William Randolph Hearst\nYeah okay I can see why you would do that how about this guy harming asks when you're you know you know tell me about a ...\nYear with a with the first drug czar in column and drug czar but he went on his ... marijuana we stay\nBack in the Nineteen thirties and Nike or any member of the movie reefer madness yeah I remember ... and this was a\nMexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to take the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually trying to twenty century Spanish civil war maybe\nAfter the stash American War of the way up there um\nAnd I started to come over here at the in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nUh the government got his great idea to uh to uh to prohibit marijuana wall with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made up they created in the campaign around\nReefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny at the time called me from Madison talks about all the stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a\nTax act or ... you put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana and they put a tax on marijuana and they said didn't declare that you had marijuana in taxes on it you go to jail\nAnd then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... or ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana is legal and it's been illegal ever set but the fact of the matter is\nIs that people have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jail are still with people who are\nThere simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least there's a police state\nAround the around people are just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through a marijuana or psychedelic or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol what we know that marijuana clause I'll tell you\nThis is the thing that uh you know and for me I guess it said to be apart from a lot of a talk show hosts are mostly conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times and they never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with a lot it every day the the feeling of a\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you try something and I looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to\nAnd he said no give it a try and he says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUm things like a cannabis that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given into and brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a museum kind of a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs to this country have such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world they they treat or this type of a crisis\nNot with jail time and and punishment they they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated and and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better\nOr a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and they're in need of a ... there were needed medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments\nAnd I think the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack or\nUh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained is going to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals where they were under a medical arrest\nThat would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because\nThe problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know the doctors do not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said at the beginning that it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep pain inside the body that is not pain\nBut it's felt physically but it's pain that is felt on a on a I guess you could call it on a conscious level or or your consciousness is he in pain are wracked with pain\nExplain I don't have those work on that I hey they do yes absolutely that's why people do it I mean I I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people I've spoken to many people who say that they like\nThings like tram at all and uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar they went over it or or biking than or\nPercocet because it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is that it makes them it takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as the roast that most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation mhm and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates this sense of I don't want to be ally basically ... you know what I mean one of the scariest\nThings one of the scariest things about opiates then I'll tell you this this was a scary for me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery and uh I was given a a pain mad I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital\nAnd all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling the stitches and you're going to this is my got here it's been caught you know you can't move because you know your your core has been cut and you can't move\nAnd it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced\nAnd that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication or to get rid of my pain and see that's the thing is it's the idea of the balance at times\nFeeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of of calm where you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you\nAnd the pan is gone but like I said before there's dependence where you take that pain away because you're dependent on appeal to take the pain away and then when the pain is gone and you still take the pill that's when you realize maybe I'm addicted or maybe have an addiction to the smoke\nIs your body down regulating some natural production\nSo all of a sudden your decision you're out like you say you're out a ballot what's really interesting to me why and how much of this stuff to talk about an exit central pain for example could be related to things like in information inside the body\nFrom too much sugar Yeah Yup or outwardly sufficiency maybe we're not getting enough I think we know you take zinc out of the diet\nCompletely one of the things that happened to get anxious to get to ...\nSo maybe there's people are suffering from from this condition supposedly never teaches this stuff but now they they gave us the food pyramid but they never say hey you know what if you eliminate sugar from your diet\nSide of the information is going to go away just like that you were to lose weight you're going to feel better about yourself and that's how it's going to happen\nBut we live in an empire quiet where the empire depends on us eating sugar and eating grains and eating fast food and eating and eating and eating so they\nWell can be created yeah we again it comes right back down to understanding our bodies understand our body chemistry and this is what I dedicated my life to helping people understand how their bodies work at a biochemical weapons or biochemical level at all [noise] and that's what we need to be educating our ...\nAnd easy an ad that die you're gonna have blood sugar from\nThe regular party a vascular ... that's the thing is that you know if he were to tell us more about what needs to be put in the body ... instead of having his gas I think a lot more people would be healthier we wouldn't have to worry

falling thought and then he figured out you figured you know what\nI think he talked to a friend who told him and do this if I remember the story right which I might be missing some of the details\nAnd he just showed up to work on Monday I Pretend to like nothing had happened and it worked\nEveryone just acted like he was fine and he just you know they maybe they forgot to melt the outer just chose to ignore the whole thing but they wanted him there and he showed up at everyone just what about their business no he said there was not even a conversation about it [noise]\nAh so I think that's what it lives with one thing she's going to do when it comes right for the presidents I think are approaches hey America let's just pretend that that whole thing\nDidn't happen let's just get past the whole DNA thing and\nI'm Still your progressive heroine right let let's pretend that that's the case show um that's not going to fly\nAnd we heard there from Debbie White delve a poor echo who is the descendant of the real Pocahontas Pocahontas was a real person it's you know John Smith honest although I gotta say John I think that the Pocahontas animated Disney film is one of the weaker ones not not good\nCan use ... with all the colors of the mountain I don't even know what that means right and that was not particularly in June you get the idea you know what I'm Talking about some of the some of the young ones and they're like yeah I liked the Pocahontas but yeah it's fun\nI mean the best you should actually you know I you know people are gonna get married for this one I think you got to figure the best animated Disney movie\nIt's tied for me between a Latin in Lion King I mean their their neck in neck I think those are those are two of the best I'm also very partial to beauty and the beast although no it's a little more for him to be a little more for the ladies but it's very well done with the first animated film ever nominate for Oscar okay bakar poker\nBack to a descendant of the real Pocahontas so you have it ah what what you saw here was that the left\nHas this whole framework of something they call cultural appropriation right the last has this framework where they will say\nUm you are not allowed to make the cuisine of another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the uh the garb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept because all culture boroughs and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time\nIn fact if you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions today come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lot of stuff\nSo I mean you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a you know getting a pattern from Malaysia ... let me think of as a very ... be\nNorthern northeastern American kind of a thing but no uh comes from Malaysia ah Sears sucker comes from India you've heard me talk about that before so\nCold culture is always changing and shifting and we should celebrate anything that's good at any culture right is this notion that people have a a particular claim on a culture strikes me as odd to begin with but if you're going to be policing appropriation\nThen for somebody who is as white as Elizabeth Warren\nTo claim that she was a Native American specifically for the benefits they're all but also\nReally to to to have some kind of an identity to make her a more interesting person which I think was all part of this I mean she wrote in she was a fake Cherokee who wrote into a cookbook called powwow chow\nAnd do all the recipe from my real French chef and called it a charity recipe so it's a fake charity stealing from a French chef to make a fake Cherokee recipe\nWow\nThat is this is the person who wants to be the next president of the states by the way you know there are a lot of personal failings there are a lot of things that I think I you know you could point you in any number of people and say you know that I could have made that mistake you know there's\nThere's there's certain things that you\nCan feel a little bit of a personal understanding\nOf it and say you know what that person may be crossed the line with that or\nThat went bad but\nI can understand how it got there I can understand what the circumstances were that led to it a being that way I'm pretending or Native American for many many years is not one of them are and and I played\nThat story for you yesterday was she talking about her mom and how her mom was dealing with the sting of racism because of her Cherokee family really\nTheir parents were or\nYou know the parents involved here were worried about the grandparents I guess for Elizabeth Warren\nAbout a maybe eighth ninth tenth generation back Native American ancestor that's a that's pretty crazy that's pretty well but\nCultural appropriation was always destined to collapse under its own stupidity and the moment that it is politically advantageous to less will try it out once again unless it oh no you can't do that you can't wear that kind of costume although I saw this stupid\nHulu all these platforms are just overrun by lives can we get some normal people involved oh who had\nSomething about this Halloween you don't wear costume that's offensive to any culture or a culture ancestry or whatever\nOkay so now that means you know no costumes or somebody dressed as a Native American garbage can dress up as Pocahontas you can dress up as any of the foreign Disney Princess is\nA ... and I just wonder you know what but if you're if you're a non white then under liberal rules do you have the right to dress up as anything that's not as any person or you know any entity that non white\nFor a Halloween then so is it really just white people that aren't allowed to dress up in and cultural gar\nThat's not you know I guess I could wear a Viking ... I mean I could wear a Viking thing but\nI don't know I don't know what the rules are and here's write off for you I don't think the left knows what the rules are either I mean I think that they\nIn general just make it up as they go along and this is just a power trip it's all a power to remember political correctness started out as a means of trying to rebalance power for what they thought were a underrepresented indiscriminate minorities but with time political correctness is just turn into a weapon\nFor those who want to use those groups\nAnd I'm Talking about white liberals now for their own purposes right to use those groups for their own power so close to appropriations they stupid term but bottom line here is that if what Elizabeth Warren did knock cultural appropriation\nThere is no such thing he does not exist even for ...

Republicans way\nAnd then the same time she was saying but I refused to let the Republicans you know she she goes from anything goes just wind power to oh I'm so outraged that how how rough the Republicans play this game this reminds me of what we saw after Kavanaugh after the Kavanaugh\nTravesty that was televised for the whole nation is after all of that\nThe Democrats didn't take a step back and say you know maybe we shouldn't have been psychopathic about this maybe we shouldn't have tried to enrich your lipstick fashion torture man on TV in front of his wife and children tens of millions of Americans were watching because we just really want a Supreme Court justice there that agrees with us ideologically that's all it was\nWasn't about women wasn't about sexual assault that was all part of\nThe smear campaign\nWas the plan all along it was about power it was about a Supreme Court seat but their take away from that\nWasn't okay hold on a second maybe we shouldn't have gone quite so dirty maybe we shouldn't have taken it to shut extreme lengths and engage in such represents will be hit or no they came within the Republicans were playing so mean\nThe Republicans were so mean to editor in chief of political\nWrote an editorial he says you know I guess the gloves have to come off though if that's the gloves on meaning Kavanaugh and what they did to him gloves off I'm Sorry I mean gloves off after what they did a cabinet could only mean\nViolence and and widespread civil disobedience and and writing in the streets I mean there's just there's nothing else you know that if you're going to take it to the level of because remember\nThey didn't just want to destroy cameras turf they were talking about trying to trying to dredge up criminal charges against him oh there's no statute of limitations in Maryland oh there should be a criminal investigation all she's ready to go to the police\nThey wanted him in prison they want her to use the state to lock up Kevin on not just stop him from the Supreme Court they would do anything as long as it was going to destroy\nAnd they thought that wasn't enough they thought that was playing by gentlemen Lee rules\nHow do you have a conversation with people like that how do you have a discussion with people who take that approach the answer is I I don't know what they call you can do you stay true to yourself stay strong and when\nI'm now seeing the wisdom of Donald Trump telling us all that we're going to win so much we're going to get tired of winning we need you\nThe alternative is putting

again for your great show Katie thank you for your great message\nNow I Need some advice to help resolve the political dispute\nMy dad and I are unexpectedly at odds in an upcoming state election in Mississippi\nWe're having a special election that is putting two Republicans against each other one is a Tea Party candidate who is skewing the truth to the point of light and who perhaps has been involved and questionable a pub a publicity schemes the other is an establishment centers former Democrat\nI'm not looking for an endorsement for either\nBut for your political philosophy given the option between a dirty Kennedy that aligns with you politically and a candidate you can trust to vote more moderate leaving you prefer who do you choose thanks for your opinion\nKatie Katie a very very a thoughtful question from you thank you so much riding in\nUm who do well you know\nSince I Do not know either the people in this specific Mississippi raised this is just a question of establishing maybe a a means of uh judging similar situations this is really about what is my benchmark do I want somebody who votes the way I Want or acts the way I Want but doesn't vote the way I Want and a politician\nAnd I have to say that I've evolved on this issue with it\nI think that ah principles are most important for you and your day to day life the principles and politicians can be very hard to come by and to have a ... a politician who holds principles but no power is pretty useless so I Would tend to say in the current political climate\nWhere centrism is really not a thing there's no spirit a bipartisan a pipe bipartisanship whatsoever there's no effort you meet in the middle of image look what happened with justice capital\nI I think you've got to do for whoever can deliver the policy wins that's my honest assessment now that varies I mean there's there's people that are shady and there's people who are who are grotesque and and deeply corrupt and it's not the same thing uh but yeah I Would I Would take a trustworthy\nOn policy but shady personally conservative or Republican or Tea Party or whatever over a upstanding\nBut legislatively on palatable Democrat I suspect\nRobin writes yesterday you stated you wonder if the press is delusional or just not that smart it is both it's a time where introspection is essentially a profession for over sensitive

I'm Down to it I'm all funny on ... and then\nOh well now let me lecture you all on the constitution in my course see I I'm I'm poor impression voice it's like no\nIf you want to engage in political issues you have to be willing to when you have to be willing to defend them as as a serious person and not hide behind oh man I just have I just have fake puppets calling into my show beforehand you know it's all just a big joke man that's dishonest\nAnd Stuart's done lots of that you know shows all jokes and then he has on a serious guest and if it's a conservative he tries to drill them and if it's a a liberal it's all a joke joke the rights so dumb ha ha\nAnd that was what he did I mean he really just ... what you already have in mainstream media a step further the mainstream media is an echo chamber for left wing beliefs in ideology and what it does is create a forum and this is whether you read the pages of the New York times or watching CNN we're liberal ideas when\nThat's the whole point that's the whole purpose yes they give you information you know yes there is reporting all others reporting and you know breaking news and all this\nBut the live ID it always\nComes out on top and that's the last what those\nOutlets to to really serve their audiences and have a loyal audience because people want that they want to believe that want to believe that their side is is winning\nBut the way that the left does it as dishonest they don't say we're labs your idea they say this is just reality this is just the truth and that's why I say that CNN for example launder Z liberalism through a false prism of neutrality\nAnd that's the secret sauce behind what the mainstream media in particular has been doing for a very long time oh no we're not liberal we're just we're just the facts man CNN's apple and banana slogan no that's nonsense\nThey should just say yeah we're we're in a package of the DNC we believe the Democratic party we're going to bring your news but we're going to give it to you for a Democrat perspective that would be honest instead they're liars they're liars tapper liar\nBlitzer wired I mean what they're doing is they live on a regular basis\nCooper all or at all I mean Don Lemon is like a whole other that's a whole other level but\nYou know he's right about the stewards right about the narcissism point\nAnd it's so clear and quite honestly I think it's pretty obvious I don't think that Stewart has come upon some bit of brilliance ear yeah the narcissism is what the narcissism is what the Trump taps into of cars look he understands\nPeople with big egos Trump is a very very big ego we I don't think we have to dance around that Trump is a very typical guy\nHe's also the leader of the free world and pulled off the most incredible election victory that we will ever see ever there's there's never going to be anything like that they use all the most unbelievable election of your life on ice all of my lifetime that's it there's nothing that's ever going to be like that\nBecause even if something else is kinda like in the future will be like well remember that time when Trump did that thing that nobody believed could happen so I think the guy is kind of earn the right to have a bit of a you know you got to earn your ego I think that's an important thing for\nEveryone to remember and then you know\nBe humble too but that's one part that I don't think we're going to too much from a for Trump but nonetheless he understands people's oversized egos and and this is where the media just really has no they have no response whatsoever that there's nothing that they can come up with as an answer because it's so once you get older you go oh yeah that's right\nWhy is everyone else press briefing about Jim Acosta wires every\nA criticism of CNN by the president of a threat to our democracy\nBecause these people have really over inflated senses of their importance let me tell you this and you know you hear this from me all the time I Am lucky to be in this business and I'm Better at this then\nFast majority of people who are in the business and I don't say that to be a modest and just being object and being honest with you know very few people can carry a three hour a day scripted unscripted rather radio show very very few people can really do that um but that's not to say that I also don't ... I Am lucky\nI Am lucky to be able to do this for a living I'm lucky that this is my job this is my job is just my calling my career because of all of you who listen to the show\nYou are the reason that I can do this and it's only through my service my constant effort to meet the expectations and the information or entertainment\nOr needs of this wonderful audience all of you listening that I'm able to do this but I I have no expectation that oh you know I'm American\nBooks Sexton or else of course not right that that's just that's just silly that's just nonsense\nBut do you see that a lot of these other big journal ties that that some of these big oh if they really think oh my gosh without us talk of the republic time probably be better off that the real for that is one when Trump calls him out that's when they get so upset because again they probably would be a you know easier without some of these out what's out there\nI think some of them do act in bad faith and do spread misinformation and propaganda and and don't have a good eat those and an artful of honest people and I mean some of the big the biggest players in the space\nBut it's it's such an important thing you should always feel like anyone that you see in in media anyone in journalism especially on the TV side of the things they should feel blessed and lucky and be always exuding a sense of\nThanks and gratitude to the audience that gives them their job and the moment that they lose sight of that you know that that then you turn into one of these overpaid CNN cry babies you know the moment they lose that that then you start getting this mentality you see what you know the the Acosta effect\nOf like oh I'm just I I Want to U.S policy questions but first I Want to ask like what the president hurts my feelings and like let me just to the story about me\nThat that's the ... the Achilles' heel of the media Trump knows it and he keeps going after it and he should and that's why he keeps winning on the radio\nCan't help but feel like this narrative that just came out today oh yeah there were secrets of peanut for Trump they're trying to make some people out there I remember you know what I Know that this was all garbage you know what I Know that there was no Russia collusion that people think there was are\nDelusional and you know and all the rest of it but there are people out there there are people who are still oh I'm On the fence about this I don't really know and it and if they hear\nThat there's a secret subpoenas for Trump they may say wow I guess maybe there is something to that you know I'm actually going to go for the Democrat last minute I I think I'm going to cast my vote if it's a tight election I'm not really sure and you know I I Believe the rhetoric about healthcare and pre existing conditions that all that stuff I'm going to go the Democrats remember how upset\nThey got the media about ... saying that they were reopening Hillary's email investigation whatever that was a couple of weeks before the election remember how just oh my God it was so turtles unfair\nI think that they would feel completely justified in what is essentially a bad faith leak story like this meant to\nCreate the perception that there's more to the Russia collusion narrative than there is\nI I think that that's you know that's something that\nCould very well happen and you know I haven't spoken much about this uh this summer I think those are things that only journalist really care about but I'll just give me the quick in the quick and dirty on it so there was a a guy tied to the gateway\nPundits oh whose name is actually is keeping me right now but he ah what is this guy's name again I'd never heard of him before Jacob wool a twenty year old a twenty year old for right Internet personality who has written for the gateway pundit um he\nAllegedly tried to entice a woman to claim that Mueller and sexually harassed her in the most\nHam fisted\nStupid ridiculous [noise] kinda transparently\nObvious thing imaginable basically was offering women money to live out more\nI was going to get a report on the allegations are what I don't think he understood is that of all the people that you would kind of mess with right now if you you know that's I don't care who you are fake sexual assault or fake sexual harassment allegations are despicable I don't care who we are talking about\nWe don't lie about people we get them on what they did or you know what they are guilty of we never should get people anyone any\nYou know somebody levels fake sexual harassment allegations against Hillary why\nI wouldn't want that that's not okay I wouldn't be okay with that right we can get around all the other crimes she's committed but you don't ever put fake stuff out there but this gateway pointed guy or he writes for the gateway pundit he looks like he tried to entice somebody to lie about Mueller and that is not a bear that I Would poke let me tell you\nA for all the nonsense about Russia collusion how it's going nowhere\nMowers of federal prosecutors ... a lot of power I Will not mess with [noise]\n\nThe news radio I'm Brian should President Trump is

Wilson threatened and got a panelist on CNN like a fish so my plea to the e as if you're going to blame that Trump's rhetoric friend site and that they need to take a look in the air and think about the things that you're saying is well\nIt is an amazing phenomenon to have seen in the last couple of weeks and we've been talking about it a lot on the show\nThat there's a there's kind of a refrain a deal when it comes to media that you know they basically just saying that conservatives hey evil fascist races terrorists why don't we all just stop using mean words\nThat's exactly right they they I mean I think it was a perfect example of how the media talks about the other side on on Monday Night on his show he urged not to demonize people\nAnd that ... people saying that white people are responsible for terrorism in this country in the literal same brat\nSo these people and they talk about our speck in the other side and rationing down its course and being respectful but they're often

and do what you're saying now that was an isolated case no just few minutes later in the basement where the uh protesters had finally figured out the senators on coming through the main lobby they're going in the basement they were gathering there too\n[noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n\nIt just becomes like a strange church of protesters are really strange church of protesters and I think these

Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture and she walked into the the uh same hallway where the robots\nWhere where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nAre you how do you have in our will make I mean how do you find out how to do on that cap\nI Will be I Will be voting yes\nOn per se hit the final confirmation vote and I will announce my intention signed to how to vote later today than they\nDo Susan Collins earlier today before she delivered that epic address tonight who just some magical day and again I go\nBack to the discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes the salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I would've said you're on your mind you need to put down the pipe\nBut no that's exactly how this worked out Susan\nCollins gave such a brilliant and measured address today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet of what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she give a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady get fined for more than Thirty years why can only hope that the cabin uh I'm In age and it's where the press has finally hit rock bottom\nAgainst this backdrop sat each intervention well senator side what the constitution said price\nConsent to ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said\nThat he thinks next year\nTwenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court and with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative\nTo liberal advantage to a six three\nAnd that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would absolutely make everybody on the left to go nuts and they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be legal Armageddon for them\nSo uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan ... did today in your argument that she made her case\nWas to talk about something that the left would not let us get through\nAnd that was the presumption of innocence\nThat if you were charged with something you've used of doing something in this country we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence than it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nPrint some venison since relevant to the fight consent function when any accusation kept her\nFrom a nominee otherwise think sensory rat I worry that part of this recession could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and with the huge damage\nTo the confirmation process\nLiving for over some\nOf the allegations levied against judge cabinet illustrate why it hurts that innocence is selling for it\nI Am thinking in particular not of the allegations framed by professor for but if the allegations that plenty what teenager jets cabinet ... whole girls\nAnd use their we can stay ... gang rape\nYou know what's the most amazing here is it when you think about it\nThe apple collect the behavior of Democrats ultimately helped confirmed judge Kavanaugh and most importantly the absolute insane charges brought by Michael Avon not he\nThe guy that brought us Stormy Daniels or maybe she brought him to us\nBut Michael ... who tried to make this all about himself and his delusional dreams of being a twenty twenty presidential candidate ... brain for these insane charges that we're debunked within twenty four hours but still repeated by the mainstream media\nHave a ... may have driven Susan Collins to make this choice\nShe talked about this this wild delegation\nFish out last ditch alec gauge what's put forth without any credit supporting\nEvidence and\nSimply parish public statements stepfather\nYeah she's talking about the media should go after the ... too much you go to Susan Collins could have taken the media part but what she did was make a well reasoned well crafted\nAnd cogent argument for judge Kavanaugh by saying that what was brought up about him was totally totally without any credible evidence and certainly not even a preponderance of the evidence what a brilliant day\nIf he got a thought about that about
