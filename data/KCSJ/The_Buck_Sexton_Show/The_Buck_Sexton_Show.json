[{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "These you know the now they're really just trying to take the fun out of Halloween if you can't wear sexy costumes and you can appropriate cultures what the heck is Halloween for as an adult at least and for kids I Would note you know it maybe it's a good lesson in a sense because you end up\nRealizing that you don't really want to eat candy all the time you know you don't really want to be in a position where you're just constantly ... on racist pieces you will reach a saturation a saturation point for reaches pieces\nYou will find yourself at some point do have eaten all the M. and M. and m's the most the most popular candy in the world\nThat's right ... number one it was a random aside I almost a started\nWorking when I was waiting to go to the CIA I got a I've got a job\nOffer at a I forget which I don't remember what it's called out but some big advertising company and they wanted me to work on candy and I'm pretty sure it was the Mars account which is a M. and m's so I Would have been peddling M. and m's all over the world and most of the CIA take me thank thank God that did\nAh but yeah you read all that Kenny realized you don't want to eat that much candy as a kid you know nobody really wants to eat that much candy I mean you just reaches level where you're like I've had enough I don't really need to do this anymore and that\nSo you learn that as a kid and that but that as an adult as a guy you know you\nYou get to be a rather than women tend to dress some women some without a lawyer like buck I dress like a um I dress like a witch and not a naughty which put a scary one they do whatever that's that's cool but\nSome college age and and ... and older young women tend to dress in\nMore provocative fashion so Gonzaga is worried about this and also is a reminder for me the cultural appropriation which has gotten all this attention right now or the or the holiday season cultural appropriation is not a thing\nI it's not even that I disagree with cultural appropriation is that there is no such thing as cultural appropriate it's not even possible it's not something you couldn't do because culture doesn't belong to anyone or any group\nCulture is just a way that things are done a ... way of um either eating or dressing or speaking or any number of things\nAnd any human being can adopt any culture that they want that's just the nature of and in fact all cultures in a constant state\nOf appropriation and evolution and the only way that culture of all just by having other influences that affected so there's no such thing as a static culture therefore you can't be stealing someone's culture you can only be part of the general cultural ... most is\nLike that for a lot of fun fun word there that everybody else is engaged it as well\nBut now I also remember some of my my\nBest and worst costumes over the years John do you ever do you have a a costume that you're either very embarrassed about are very proud of\nDon't be showing don't I don't think I've ever dressed up\nAs an adult would dress up for Halloween as an adult now but I oh I see\nHow it is I see your call me out now I see what's out there is producer Mike is he going is he talking to a naughty nurse right now are sea within earshot of the microphone\nI think he's talking to a naughty secretary over somewhere that that sounds that sounds about\nRight or you know every every time I think that we could get we can catch Mike on the Mike is he's out getting phone numbers um but I and I could tell you my best costume ever was actually when I was a young adults in my early twenties in DC I found a theater supply store so I got invited to a big fancy Halloween party\nAnd I I uh theater supply store and they let me read because you want to get really high in costume and not spend a lot of money got rent it and I rented a full on theatrical production costume slash kind of\nUniform replica of general Douglas MacArthur I mean with like the ... and a pipe and the sunglasses and the whole thing man that costume was legit by the way tend to lose\nBe surprised how much attention to the ladies give to a guy walks around wearing wearing the ... so that was a very good costume I dressed up as Bjorn Borg one year or with the kind of a you know the seventies style tennis out fix I just basically\nShrank a a shirt and a lot in the in the drier by accident and I had a head band than an hour wouldn't tennis racket\nSo that worked out so I don't I don't have any fantastic costumes I'm not somebody who\nIs is quite as up on on their costume game as many others but I Hope if you do go out this weekend\nAppropriate all the culture you want and if you want to or not it costs you guys or girls ... ladies and gentlemen by all means that is that is you're right because darn it this is America a but obviously you know be safe don't don't eat too much candy corn and don't drink too much\nSpiked a trauma candy corn pumpkin juice to ... candy corn roster cheat as your ... you know this site and somebody might finally appears some ask somebody what ... what is your what is your best or worst or both Halloween costume and you can remember\nI was never a huge Halloween guy I mean the ... but other than it thought I didn't get too much into it but one year it was actually a watch my buddies and friends did a group thing and we did the ah\nAddams family and uh I was ... Adams I'm\nAnd that was fun actually 'cause there was like seven or eight of us and at the individual people were like ... who are you like what are you doing and then but then when he got altogether it was like you guys are awesome\nSo that was a sort of on\nNice Halloween parties\nThat ... I Know I'm more right\nFair enough you know and I will eat candy and I will give out the candy but er what is the best Halloween candy\nGood question I mean I I'm a I have a huge sweet to so I don't ... I go to resist visas for me like if I'm if I'm able to just pick any candy I think Greece's pieces is yeah it was pretty spectacular ... considered\nI'm a we actually got into this conversation after the other day I'm ... I'd like to freeze some of my candy and I think when you go frozen the Milky Way it doesn't get a whole lot better than that in my opinion\nWow yeah I I had not thought of that I Do know that ... for all those listening\nIf you ever like make brownies and you don't want to eat them all at once and you keep it in the freezer and then you want to put them in the microwave the you'd do maintain freshness baked goods frozen is actually a very smart thing to do yeah\nI didn't learn until like a couple of years ago and it's apparently they didn't they didn't teach us that in CIA school [laughter] so ah anyway All right yeah good good good times producer my concerns were going to come back we got our buddy Benny\nJohnson in the mix and then we've got a Stephanie\nHamilton kind of like a double dose of the Daily Caller this Friday on the show\nAnd you know before I actually did a sit down I did the federalist radio hour which the podcast today [noise] with Mollie Hemingway who's just just so cool she's great so good on on Fox so a lot of content that they oh by the way I'll be on ... show tonight at eleven pm eastern\nSo talking about all the stuff bringing all the truth of wild stuff [noise] and uh I'll be back in just [noise] the FBI calls home\nBut also have to one of the fastest growing crimes my friend's brace yourself if you've ever had your credit card stone it's nothing compared to the hell you're in for when the steals your homes title everything's online these days including your home settled domestic and international thieves\nHunt American homeowners because we have equity in our homes and the bad guys are stealing it may take you off your homes title an add an alias than they borrow hundreds of thousands using your homes equity and stick you with the payments you won't know until you get a late payment notice\nIdentity theft programs and insurance policies don't protect you\nHome title walk safeguards your homes title from cyber thieves and hackers by putting an online perimeter around your homes title\nThe instant detects on tampering with their own it to shut it down for pennies today home town of law protects my most valuable asset my family's home you needed to register for a free now says you have your homes title has been compromised it's a hundred dollar value free visit home titled rock dot com\nOr in college or in a row Super Bowl champions aren't the most important contract of his life to serve in the Army National guard\nOr a lot of military my friend was for for what's all my family's overall I Want to go out there make a difference and find the working behind the desk so familiar in ... minutes from our country was hard for them\nTo learn how to be part of the Army National guard logged on to the national guard dot com sponsored by the Colorado Army National guard\nBroadcasters association of this station Casey\nColorado's dependable accurate ballots [noise]\nFive Ninety ...\nThree open community um floating in the mid term elections because no every boat make that my opinion matters or vote I vote\nIn the mid term election to register to vote go to I Am a voter dot com and don't forget to vote Tuesday November sixth sponsored by her immediate and acidic culture coalition\nYeah and I think that ah people are starting to have second thoughts about whether or not he should run for president that strikes me as not the best move\nUh no not the best movie you've happy my question was that the un and the name of the\nMajor cheerleader from an ID or you have people at CNN or making sure that ah his name is starting to move down and the DNC a presidential candidate less or he is a Christian was said maybe it's time for us to rethink like body as being the front let her\n\nKnow I I got on how's it going to have you been ... Halloween Halloween is a holiday that some of us think\nOf as um you know for kids where do you come down on this issue\nOr it's not a hunting for kids\nIs it a holiday for kids should adults dress up I'm going to be getting into a whole sexy costume conversation coming up in a few minutes and then you know where you come down on this issue should adults we dressing up for Halloween\n[laughter] ah well I mean\nJess ... there's been a major issues in the new fight we problematic ... I think Megan Kelly had a part of this week about a\nEssentially defending it must be defending black me I don't want to do but she just doesn't have a job anymore she has six nine million dollars and our bank account oh that's great if I may Michael I guess it's be fired by NBC and to get Seventy million dollars or so um\nBut yeah I I don't I don't remember the problem here are dressed up as Brett Kavanaugh for Halloween and I'm going to wear a I've got just outfit and I'm Out of gas or an imam sign around my neck and says I like beer\nAnd and that's going to be like Oscar\nI I don't I don't really understand why a what would be you know what would be problematic for this or advocate or an adult\nNow on the Megan Kelly thing ... you should do or show back in the day at Fox I feel like you probably were in the mix for\nThat um she was the first person that ever ... ever put me on prime time at Fox oh I said yesterday that I feel like I have some you know as\nI have a certain fondness for Megan but then again I think she made ... incredibly bad decisions when it comes to leave it how she left Fox wins you love box where she went from Fox but to me it couldn't be more obvious they just wanted to get rid of her I mean this was really the ... what you said really wasn't like fire rubble offense\nWell no on the fence I mean this is sort of what happens in the media is I think that\nNBC ... looking for an excuse to get rid of backing Kelly rating for taking a she wasn't fitting into the network and I think they just is is that the number one opportunity I say there was a major that was a major conflict\n... this is the same that work but kept Matt Lauer around for decades and this is the thing that work that wouldn't want Ronan Farrow to public reporting on R B once seen on our website so this is a huge double standard\nYeah and and I I gotta say this is where we'll also see the one of one of my maxims is that the less takes care of its own where you can get terminated or on the left unless you were actually unknown predator or something really\nTerrible you know you're actually doing something that's border line up to and including the criminal or you can\nHave a second act I mean you've already seen who's the guy who ah the comedian Louis sea caves coming like these other people\nI think men Kelly's done I I don't think that you know may maybe she'll be a you know selling slow cooker is only the home shopping network or something but I don't think any major networks going to give her another shock because there's only one place where to go and she left\nThe Megan Kelly in a like infomercial for a you know to ... stay cookers would be amazing yes ah that yeah that would that would be that would be absolutely amazing but you're exactly right I mean who's going to figure out I I have no idea I I I just live on fire all of her credentials with conservatives\nAnd the concern was really loved her over ... bc\nAnd then the people that you see the left at NBC they didn't like her and the first place so they ... both sides on fire so where does she go from here and she's not going back to Fox\nAh and I\nYou know and I don't think anyone else is going to see the investment of studying million dollars are really being a meaningful or worthwhile investment because she didn't never delivered on reading\nAnd and and what university were Seventy million dollars by the way I mean ... whose idea we have\nI don't know that we're ... interview remember that that was a big break out she went and interviewed ... and\nIt doesn't even speak English how much of an interview to that really be let's get serious ... second she can't even communicate with him\nEveryone criticized driving up and down for what you are for firing for the sex and feel for everything uh it just didn't work out\nAll right for Kelly that'd be the ... and ... on the ticket disaster or the leading Fox was a huge huge issue and people that are you just got to know that there are a long time ago\nYep that is true Benny Johnson everybody follow him on Twitter his Twitter account was amazing also go to a Daily Caller to see his latest over there which

Sexton parents coming down to Washington DC this weekend they have spent very little time\nIn the swarm I I'd be willing to bet my parents probably have an overnight it in DC in Twenty years so it'll be falling to show them around a little bit and uh you know see what they think of\nThis funky little town that is our nation's capital it'd be a lot of farmers to eat a lot of good food and have some

really clear on exactly what you're asking me here buddy but I Do appreciate the ... note thank you very much\nRe Wright's book since it is technically invasion can Trump declared the border a war zone and limit media access so they can't use the pictures of the poor women and children just wandering thanks\nRay I don't think that\n[noise] well you know I think that maybe he could declared a national emergency but I don't think he'd be able to court a war zone practically as we know only Congress can declare war but here's where things get interesting\nBecause I explained to you that in terms of what the law is now and we're Congress actually is on this issue of the border and immigration\nThey can claim of this caravan can claim asylum and there was nothing to stop them necessarily from that\nBut the president as we know from the whole kerfuffle over the Muslim ban does have the ability to declare any group of aliens to be a problem for national security purposes and to borrow them entry to the United states\nTherefore the president put under his national security authority as the commander in chief and this is in congressional statute right now the president could say you're not allowed to come into this country because you were a national security threat on the commander in chief that's just the way that it is this though\nWould be challenged immediately in the courts the press would completely freak out on on this whole situation as you can imagine\nAnd a ... I'm not sure how it would even be resolved but I Do think that that just war gaming us out a little bit that could happen as a keeping the press away I'm not comfortable with trying to prevent the media from seeing something that's actually going on so I I Would not want that\nTo happen um I don't I don't I think the media should be\nAble to report on what's going on in war zone or the media should be able to report on pretty much anything that's happening here with the possible exception of things that are a him in a national security risk you know troop movements in a like a aries\n... Glenn Beck have access to your Facebook account because it seems like his monologues or an exact copy of of what I wrote you\nUm well uh aries I've I've got to take a look I don't know um I haven't actually talked to go on it a little while I mean I Know that when sorry I Know they're going to have access to my Facebook account\nWhen I met was I don't know what the lens monologues have been recently so I'll have to take a peek at that and\nI'm sure areas you're very wise men and a Glenn is a very talented entertainer so it wouldn't surprise me if you guys had some some share thoughts but I ...

healthy love for freedom and our constitutional republic lately I think Republicans fears of felons voting is misplaced this is purely anecdotal but all the possible lip voters I encountered in prison probably wouldn't go to uphold their lives depended on it and not very impressive people that's kinda where they send us keep up the good fight shields I in Georgia\nMatt Matt\n... really interesting to hear from a man I appreciate getting a perspective from somebody who has a serve\nTime for a felony and can speak to what it's like being a prisoner and also what a what the\nPolitical vibe is on

charged with something potentially explosive packages to leading Democrats President Trump calling for a change in the rhetoric\nIn recent days we've had a broader conversation about the tone and civility of our\nAnd he said it was you know really made is made out of great ingenuity but he said that he will hardly think I shall meet the test its power disclosed the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into this into the community of the spiritual movement and also it in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the ... board that we know today got his start in Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point\nSo there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada\nLots of rights from the United states to sell their own version of the wage aboard and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two and the rest is history and so bored such as Bob sport which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the wage what makes it a prominent splash into the market I mean everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this has been a spiritual moving with going big time and\nI was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat board and started doing different types of their own type a\nBoard and of course we ... the trademark tens of the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspect\nSerial killer or making a board ah basically it's ... it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he would feel right about himself or what have you ah in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned people didn't act around and start customizing selling them\nUm but the degree of this type of story no I never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money ... there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nI'm In its I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really whether or not\nYeah we we don't know if he did he checked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know that's that's the that's the thing is the avoided\nA any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so do they take it seriously\n[noise] well it's just kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling\nOn on on would just put the color a Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for current affair which is an old TV show or on a which has only channel five or something right in the east and um\nHe was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated like um show heated like producing I think mhm current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level I think it's the same image to same exact\nYou know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYou know in the in the background to write the background history\nYes and they were told and everything you know and they put it down\nSo they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but um it's the same story and it's a very and I tell people you know not to and I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old\nBecause this is real this is really happen this really works and it's very scary\nAnd if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody would call go to the same place at the end but says some bad that people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to send them back\nSo I always say that it's not a joke ...\nNo I'm In I'm going to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use the board in a long time was beyond as ... used to board\nA gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they use it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use them and you know boards rudimentary like that even even when you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights\nSo that her little boy you can go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really don't need boards do we care and I mean even the boards there or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into naval due to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own\nSix cents ... he started developing really started really being fine tune\nAnd taken about the way I can still do this work and be a lot of people is in the old days these typewriters [laughter] word processors now they use computer keyboards and the channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board the people at the tactile experience and the movement\nMovement itself that kind of opens up the receptor seek to start bringing in the information right and so again I might be required to board does know negative energy with any boy that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home so then I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen unless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that my desire or that's how I view the world so\nPeople doesn't mean you know people in these scaring us even talking about this on the radio while I have\nAre though they they they think in the they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and they don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and now it's ... motor responses are that are basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions and the mind that come from the unconscious\nIf it's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body in the brain are big transmitters\nAnd so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the board as you say is like a permission slip in a way to to view I mean people would use pencils that I I used to know a medium that would ah would he would do his thing he would just scribble he would\nTake the pencil and he would just scribble on a new bad and he just scribbling scribbling as these scribbling for some reason they just doing the scribble he's looking at this go on all I see a scribbling but what I used to what he saw it was something else and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of\nI don't know doing something with his hands on his mind was bringing in the information from getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are using something else but it certainly is there to have the mind generate or push through the body the city of motor response but certainly is a interesting and you see it in an action tonight on grounds that we're talking about Bob's warrior care and\nA dominant program who is the director of the talking more Historical Society and seen are all over and she's been a guy or a guy who showed beyond belief she's been a

lot to really tell me and you know she's a she's a frequent guest you're in but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what\nHappens to the body after he died called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked to she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she just love it you know she's great\nAnd you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into these subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students should be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nFew huh [laughter] well\nFirst of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I walked Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... one of the book and there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works

minimum destabilization\nAnd that's you know that's something that I think is a you know meet needs to be remembered here I I think Lindsey Graham is look I\nGive him a lot of credit for the whole capital thing but as much as I'd like to just look at that and say it's all fine now they're gonna get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this deal and the deal is going to be

earlier sponsored by the Colorado army now and I have no right or banning of the\nLaughable argument I mean the notion that Elizabeth Warren is a Cherokee or could consider herself a Native

from a person of color as anyone could possibly be\nAnd yet she still kinda ... she used to she still clings to it but then there was just wondering well did she receive any benefit my friends there is\nSo much circumstantial evidence that she received benefit that it is also laughable to suggest that that she did not\nUm that she did not have the ... and I'm not somebody who's a school snob but she did not have the academic pedigree for law school do then going to be a professor at the University of Pennsylvania an Ivy League school and Harvard\nConsidered to be the number one school and and really the number one law school in the United states no way that happens in last the hiring\nCommittees thinks that they can while they can but it's very important them when they put out these reports very important that they have a Native American on the faculty that's a big big deal for them they have their\nPick they can have anyone they want and that's why I also why would Elizabeth Warren list herself as such\nIt must have gave her some benefit it's a bizarre thing to do unless you are gaming the system the only reason you would do that if you were Elizabeth Warren and clearly not a person of color would be to game the system so it just defies belief it's completely ridiculous I can\nTell you that I spoke to 'cause I have access to a lot of Democrats up the hill\nOr and I spoke to Democrats today who our colleagues and I got to say there were all there were all say it\nTo this is just there's no excuse there's nothing you can say about it that she thought that this proved your case was completely insane a Donald Trump also\nWe had one more trade on this he rewrote thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is a complete and total from [laughter] sometimes referred to as Pocahontas\nHe has defeated really the progressive front runner for twenty twenty before she was even able to get into the race officially\nAnd he defeated or by getting inside her head and forcing her to make one of the great unforeseen political errors of all time I have never seen anything quite like this uh this ... this is truly truly astonishing\nBut then the president had this thing today later on that I got to say I don't know what's going on here I Want the president focused on what matters and I want the president\nOn policy amok fighting back absolutely but what is this thing about\nWhat is this thing about a ... horse Oh yes here's what he wrote federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to a legal fees\nGreat now I can go after a horse race and her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total calm\nYou know it's interesting Trump really hold out here that that this is a lie start to finish and I have thought\nThat ah that that there is no way that she's lying about Trump just because of the detail and they look they do know each other they have had contact it's not like the\nKavanaugh allegation and wanted nothing because there's nothing criminal about anything that even alleged about Trump with Stormy Daniels ah or I should say about his contact with her and people are saying was all the campaign finance that's pathetic that no no shot no chance um\nBut I got to say now I'm thinking you know is it is it ... why why do people jumped to the conclusion that Trump actually has had this affair with her\nUm what what I said I shouldn't say jumping conclusion I think that's obvious but why are we so sure\nA lot of people in those seem very brochure about it I I'm I'm just I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been any proof offered that I'm aware of\nMeaning she's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair she just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this\nHer whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ... and degrading and nasty\nToward toward the president so I'm you know I I had thought that the president this was before he was the president I have thought that maybe he and you know had strayed from his marital out here and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action in their lives um bad\nEspecially because it's you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they won't enforce it against Democrat but there's also part of me the things well you know\nMaybe there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they're all focused on the president referring to a woman as a horse race\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week in this feels a little bit like a field a little bit like an unnecessary distraction and and not something that I Would really want the president to say buttons that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're this ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle or maybe they're just going to be these you know is it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all going to be great\nSo that that's a part of it too and maybe he's human which we all know who he is maybe he's imperfect which we all know he is a and I I think that we should be able to have that chalk\nAre among those of us who really support the president and his agenda which I clearly do and still we want to say okay I kinda wish you hadn't called some woman horse race on Twitter I just I think that that's yeah that's a little\nThat's a little bit beneath where where presidents or B that said he's been crushing everything else all week and been amazing so you know so he's not perfect it's pretty darn good though so you know I'll give it to him on that and that's I I think that's an okay standard to have for politicians you know is not perfect me pretty darn good\nIt really is um and I I've seen recently some some conservatives that things start to come around to this notion of why do we have to why don't we have to pretend like any politicians perfect\nWhy do we have to pretend like anyone is is beyond or not just pretend but hold them up to this standard of of moral pro bitty that isn't there for anybody else really in public life\nLook Trump is made more mistakes than a lot of other folks in that area but he's also clearly got a gift for politics for entertainment and he is he is the man for this era\nOr Elizabeth Warren let ... let me tell you why I said let me tell you why I say that instead of just staying in our ... let me break that down a little bit wider here's a perfect example of why I give Trump a lot of leeway why I cut this president a lot of slack\nOn some of the tweets are some of the stuff he says about you know people here or there that I feel like maybe ... is going a little far here's why\nIf it weren't for someone like Donald Trump if we had a Mitt Romney instead of Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren was going to be twenty twenty candidate it would just be him getting attacked all the time our guy getting attacked not fighting back and Elizabeth Warren getting away with being a huge fraud\nWho advocates for all kinds of class warfare while she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year as a she was at a tenured professor at Harvard law school I think a quarter of a million dollars a year he's making plenty of money she's got plenty of money\nUm and and all of that false miss all that fall so that she's out they're peddling to people would really go unchallenged than a meaningful way and the worst of all if she were to win the presidency against a Romney like figure\nYou and I would have a harder time\nPutting food on the table paying our mortgages or in my case rent you know paying bills taking care of family taking care of medical bills would all be harder because of Elizabeth Warren because she has wrong ideas because she's self involves because she doesn't\nUnderstand the way the world really works and because she's benefited from this system\nThe system in place that the left holds up at all costs of some people you know get a get special privileges some people will get pushed through now and and others are told well you have some form of privilege so you have to just suffer in silence I'm Sorry\nAt Trump has saved us from yet another progressive\nDestruction machine this case would've been Elizabeth Warren's while I'm laughing about the whole thing he's also don't the nation a great service by making sure that Elizabeth Warren focus hunters does not become president on the radio on\nIf I died yesterday dot [noise]\n\nThis wave of a just a a restoration of concern or the restoration of concern for our financial future for just so many um so many things that all of a sudden we're at the top of the list right\nAnd and also restoration of the American founding as as a topic of conversation\nI I'm just saying we're we're not we have not done anything about this yet and we've had a Republican House Republican Congress I'm Sorry what was the Senate and White House now for almost two years\nAnd we haven't taken action and I worry that we're not going to take action I worry that this is June going to become\nOne of these issues where are we all talk of big game we all talked talked tough on this\nBut at the end of the day nobody wants to be the one that says that we got to spend less Republicans will talk about okay we can't tax more fine but the truth is we've got to spend less and that means we're going to spend less on Social Security and Medicaid or Medicare Medicaid\nThat's what it means that is what it means or else it it has no meaning and Republicans don't want to hear that and I know a lot of the folks listening to this than I have a tough time with that they feel like they paid in and so it's not\nAn entitlement at the government you know making amends for taking money from them for all those years Social Security is pretty much true we just need to change the structure of a long term Medicare it's not true with Medicare your kids if you're listening to this really actually your grandkids if your Medicare age they're the ones and your great grandkids\nAre going to be paying the financial price for the care that people take it out of the system today\nIt's not right it's intergenerational theft and I know people don't want to hear it but that's just the truth\nMeanwhile the feds collected record income taxes in twenty Eighteen so you know we're always told oh there's not enough there was not enough or you know revenue there's not revenue which there's too much more than a revenue there's too much spending\nGovernment has got to rein it in and in less were you know we're\nEither going to have a serious national conversation about this and take action we're going to suffer some really horrific economic consequences and by the time the consequences are obvious it's going to be tough to turn it around and that's just the truth\nI I'm a look we'll continue to talk about this issue because it matters but I I won't hormone or too much fucking Ron Paul did it for a little bit that was interesting he served as a big lead ...

year old boy twelve year old anybody um that's not cool it's not nice it's not fair and it's a on becoming\nSo I'm not commenting on a twelve year old\nAs somebody with strong opinions and who goes

seems to think that it is not just normal but expected for a twelve year old to be quote an act of asked\nKids should be allowed to be kids and the only way that a a normal child would feel the need to come home and cry\nBecause that young girl met another girl who did not show described as a feminist\nIs because the parents are engaging in a really relentless propaganda campaign toward their own children now parents can raise kids with whatever believes they want but I I Would just note that\nI think that they're doing a disservice I think that anyone does a disservice to a very young person by ... really instilling in um a radical leftist belief\nAnd not letting them keep an open minded and develop their their own beliefs but I also think that increasingly parents these days and just adults in general in America who our lives who are liberals have absolutely no perspective on these issues they they have no ability\nTo stand back and try to be a little objective their purpose other kids and you know letting their kids\nCome to their own beliefs and not feel familial pressure to take certain positions because even as an adult you should always be testing and retesting your

I I I blame will William Randolph Hearst\nYeah okay I can see why you would do that how about this guy harming asks when you're you know you know tell me about a ...\nYear with a with the first drug czar in column and drug czar but he went on his ... marijuana we stay\nBack in the Nineteen thirties and Nike or any member of the movie reefer madness yeah I remember ... and this was a\nMexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to take the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually trying to twenty century Spanish civil war maybe\nAfter the stash American War of the way up there um\nAnd I started to come over here at the in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nUh the government got his great idea to uh to uh to prohibit marijuana wall with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made up they created in the campaign around\nReefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny at the time called me from Madison talks about all the stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a\nTax act or ... you put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana and they put a tax on marijuana and they said didn't declare that you had marijuana in taxes on it you go to jail\nAnd then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... or ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana is legal and it's been illegal ever set but the fact of the matter is\nIs that people have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jail are still with people who are\nThere simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least there's a police state\nAround the around people are just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through a marijuana or psychedelic or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol what we know that marijuana clause I'll tell you\nThis is the thing that uh you know and for me I guess it said to be apart from a lot of a talk show hosts are mostly conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times and they never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with a lot it every day the the feeling of a\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you try something and I looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to\nAnd he said no give it a try and he says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUm things like a cannabis that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given into and brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a museum kind of a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs to this country have such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world they they treat or this type of a crisis\nNot with jail time and and punishment they they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated and and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better\nOr a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and they're in need of a ... there were needed medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments\nAnd I think the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack or\nUh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained is going to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals where they were under a medical arrest\nThat would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because\nThe problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know the doctors do not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said at the beginning that it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep pain inside the body that is not pain\nBut it's felt physically but it's pain that is felt on a on a I guess you could call it on a conscious level or or your consciousness is he in pain are wracked with pain\nExplain I don't have those work on that I hey they do yes absolutely that's why people do it I mean I I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people I've spoken to many people who say that they like\nThings like tram at all and uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar they went over it or or biking than or\nPercocet because it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is that it makes them it takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as the roast that most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation mhm and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates this sense of I don't want to be ally basically ... you know what I mean one of the scariest\nThings one of the scariest things about opiates then I'll tell you this this was a scary for me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery and uh I was given a a pain mad I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital\nAnd all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling the stitches and you're going to this is my got here it's been caught you know you can't move because you know your your core has been cut and you can't move\nAnd it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced\nAnd that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication or to get rid of my pain and see that's the thing is it's the idea of the balance at times\nFeeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of of calm where you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you\nAnd the pan is gone but like I said before there's dependence where you take that pain away because you're dependent on appeal to take the pain away and then when the pain is gone and you still take the pill that's when you realize maybe I'm addicted or maybe have an addiction to the smoke\nIs your body down regulating some natural production\nSo all of a sudden your decision you're out like you say you're out a ballot what's really interesting to me why and how much of this stuff to talk about an exit central pain for example could be related to things like in information inside the body\nFrom too much sugar Yeah Yup or outwardly sufficiency maybe we're not getting enough I think we know you take zinc out of the diet\nCompletely one of the things that happened to get anxious to get to ...\nSo maybe there's people are suffering from from this condition supposedly never teaches this stuff but now they they gave us the food pyramid but they never say hey you know what if you eliminate sugar from your diet\nSide of the information is going to go away just like that you were to lose weight you're going to feel better about yourself and that's how it's going to happen\nBut we live in an empire quiet where the empire depends on us eating sugar and eating grains and eating fast food and eating and eating and eating so they\nWell can be created yeah we again it comes right back down to understanding our bodies understand our body chemistry and this is what I dedicated my life to helping people understand how their bodies work at a biochemical weapons or biochemical level at all [noise] and that's what we need to be educating our ...\nAnd easy an ad that die you're gonna have blood sugar from\nThe regular party a vascular ... that's the thing is that you know if he were to tell us more about what needs to be put in the body ... instead of having his gas I think a lot more people would be healthier we wouldn't have to worry

falling thought and then he figured out you figured you know what\nI think he talked to a friend who told him and do this if I remember the story right which I might be missing some of the details\nAnd he just showed up to work on Monday I Pretend to like nothing had happened and it worked\nEveryone just acted like he was fine and he just you know they maybe they forgot to melt the outer just chose to ignore the whole thing but they wanted him there and he showed up at everyone just what about their business no he said there was not even a conversation about it [noise]\nAh so I think that's what it lives with one thing she's going to do when it comes right for the presidents I think are approaches hey America let's just pretend that that whole thing\nDidn't happen let's just get past the whole DNA thing and\nI'm Still your progressive heroine right let let's pretend that that's the case show um that's not going to fly\nAnd we heard there from Debbie White delve a poor echo who is the descendant of the real Pocahontas Pocahontas was a real person it's you know John Smith honest although I gotta say John I think that the Pocahontas animated Disney film is one of the weaker ones not not good\nCan use ... with all the colors of the mountain I don't even know what that means right and that was not particularly in June you get the idea you know what I'm Talking about some of the some of the young ones and they're like yeah I liked the Pocahontas but yeah it's fun\nI mean the best you should actually you know I you know people are gonna get married for this one I think you got to figure the best animated Disney movie\nIt's tied for me between a Latin in Lion King I mean their their neck in neck I think those are those are two of the best I'm also very partial to beauty and the beast although no it's a little more for him to be a little more for the ladies but it's very well done with the first animated film ever nominate for Oscar okay bakar poker\nBack to a descendant of the real Pocahontas so you have it ah what what you saw here was that the left\nHas this whole framework of something they call cultural appropriation right the last has this framework where they will say\nUm you are not allowed to make the cuisine of another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the uh the garb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept because all culture boroughs and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time\nIn fact if you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions today come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lot of stuff\nSo I mean you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a you know getting a pattern from Malaysia ... let me think of as a very ... be\nNorthern northeastern American kind of a thing but no uh comes from Malaysia ah Sears sucker comes from India you've heard me talk about that before so\nCold culture is always changing and shifting and we should celebrate anything that's good at any culture right is this notion that people have a a particular claim on a culture strikes me as odd to begin with but if you're going to be policing appropriation\nThen for somebody who is as white as Elizabeth Warren\nTo claim that she was a Native American specifically for the benefits they're all but also\nReally to to to have some kind of an identity to make her a more interesting person which I think was all part of this I mean she wrote in she was a fake Cherokee who wrote into a cookbook called powwow chow\nAnd do all the recipe from my real French chef and called it a charity recipe so it's a fake charity stealing from a French chef to make a fake Cherokee recipe\nWow\nThat is this is the person who wants to be the next president of the states by the way you know there are a lot of personal failings there are a lot of things that I think I you know you could point you in any number of people and say you know that I could have made that mistake you know there's\nThere's there's certain things that you\nCan feel a little bit of a personal understanding\nOf it and say you know what that person may be crossed the line with that or\nThat went bad but\nI can understand how it got there I can understand what the circumstances were that led to it a being that way I'm pretending or Native American for many many years is not one of them are and and I played\nThat story for you yesterday was she talking about her mom and how her mom was dealing with the sting of racism because of her Cherokee family really\nTheir parents were or\nYou know the parents involved here were worried about the grandparents I guess for Elizabeth Warren\nAbout a maybe eighth ninth tenth generation back Native American ancestor that's a that's pretty crazy that's pretty well but\nCultural appropriation was always destined to collapse under its own stupidity and the moment that it is politically advantageous to less will try it out once again unless it oh no you can't do that you can't wear that kind of costume although I saw this stupid\nHulu all these platforms are just overrun by lives can we get some normal people involved oh who had\nSomething about this Halloween you don't wear costume that's offensive to any culture or a culture ancestry or whatever\nOkay so now that means you know no costumes or somebody dressed as a Native American garbage can dress up as Pocahontas you can dress up as any of the foreign Disney Princess is\nA ... and I just wonder you know what but if you're if you're a non white then under liberal rules do you have the right to dress up as anything that's not as any person or you know any entity that non white\nFor a Halloween then so is it really just white people that aren't allowed to dress up in and cultural gar\nThat's not you know I guess I could wear a Viking ... I mean I could wear a Viking thing but\nI don't know I don't know what the rules are and here's write off for you I don't think the left knows what the rules are either I mean I think that they\nIn general just make it up as they go along and this is just a power trip it's all a power to remember political correctness started out as a means of trying to rebalance power for what they thought were a underrepresented indiscriminate minorities but with time political correctness is just turn into a weapon\nFor those who want to use those groups\nAnd I'm Talking about white liberals now for their own purposes right to use those groups for their own power so close to appropriations they stupid term but bottom line here is that if what Elizabeth Warren did knock cultural appropriation\nThere is no such thing he does not exist even for ...

left she saying on the one hand do you have to do to win big\nRight do whatever you got to do I mean that that's really what follows these views on this do whatever you got to do I just don't let the Republicans way\nAnd then the same time she was saying but I refused to let the Republicans you know she she goes from anything goes just wind power to oh I'm so outraged that how how rough the Republicans play this game this reminds me of what we saw after Kavanaugh after the Kavanaugh\nTravesty that was televised for the whole nation is after all of that\nThe Democrats didn't take a step back and say you know maybe we shouldn't have been psychopathic about this maybe we shouldn't have tried to enrich your lipstick fashion torture man on TV in front of his wife and children tens of millions of Americans were watching because we just really want a Supreme Court justice there that agrees with us ideologically that's all it was\nWasn't about women wasn't about sexual assault that was all part of\nThe smear campaign\nWas the plan all along it was about power it was about a Supreme Court seat but their take away from that\nWasn't okay hold on a second maybe we shouldn't have gone quite so dirty maybe we shouldn't have taken it to shut extreme lengths and engage in such represents will be hit or no they came within the Republicans were playing so mean\nThe Republicans were so mean to editor in chief of political\nWrote an editorial he says you know I guess the gloves have to come off though if that's the gloves on meaning Kavanaugh and what they did to him gloves off I'm Sorry I mean gloves off after what they did a cabinet could only mean\nViolence and and widespread civil disobedience and and writing in the streets I mean there's just there's nothing else you know that if you're going to take it to the level of because remember\nThey didn't just want to destroy cameras turf they were talking about trying to trying to dredge up criminal charges against him oh there's no statute of limitations in Maryland oh there should be a criminal investigation all she's ready to go to the police\nThey wanted him in prison they want her to use the state to lock up Kevin on not just stop him from the Supreme Court they would do anything as long as it was going to destroy\nAnd they thought that wasn't enough they thought that was playing by gentlemen Lee rules\nHow do you have a conversation with people like that how do you have a discussion with people who take that approach the answer is I I don't know what they call you can do you stay true to yourself stay strong and when\nI'm now seeing the wisdom of Donald Trump telling us all that we're going to win so much we're going to get tired of winning we need you\nThe alternative is putting people in positions of power who cannot be trusted with it who do not act with decency who do not act in good faith do not care about the law and which perhaps most disturbing the both the or even

again for your great show Katie thank you for your great message\nNow I Need some advice to help resolve the political dispute\nMy dad and I are unexpectedly at odds in an upcoming state election in Mississippi\nWe're having a special election that is putting two Republicans against each other one is a Tea Party candidate who is skewing the truth to the point of light and who perhaps has been involved and questionable a pub a publicity schemes the other is an establishment centers former Democrat\nI'm not looking for an endorsement for either\nBut for your political philosophy given the option between a dirty Kennedy that aligns with you politically and a candidate you can trust to vote more moderate leaving you prefer who do you choose thanks for your opinion\nKatie Katie a very very a thoughtful question from you thank you so much riding in\nUm who do well you know\nSince I Do not know either the people in this specific Mississippi raised this is just a question of establishing maybe a a means of uh judging similar situations this is really about what is my benchmark do I want somebody who votes the way I Want or acts the way I Want but doesn't vote the way I Want and a politician\nAnd I have to say that I've evolved on this issue with it\nI think that ah principles are most important for you and your day to day life the principles and politicians can be very hard to come by and to have a ... a politician who holds principles but no power is pretty useless so I Would tend to say in the current political climate\nWhere centrism is really not a thing there's no spirit a bipartisan a pipe bipartisanship whatsoever there's no effort you meet in the middle of image look what happened with justice capital\nI I think you've got to do for whoever can deliver the policy wins that's my honest assessment now that varies I mean there's there's people that are shady and there's people who are who are grotesque and and deeply corrupt and it's not the same thing uh but yeah I Would I Would take a trustworthy\nOn policy but shady personally conservative or Republican or Tea Party or whatever over a upstanding\nBut legislatively on palatable Democrat I suspect\nRobin writes yesterday you stated you wonder if the press is delusional or just not that smart it is both it's a time where introspection is essentially a profession for over sensitive

I Am lucky\nI Am lucky to be able to do this for a living I'm lucky that this is my job this is my job is just my calling my career because of all of you who listen to the show\nYou are the reason that I can do this and it's only through my service my constant effort to meet the expectations and the information or entertainment\nOr needs of this wonderful audience all of you listening that I'm able to do this but I I have no expectation that oh you know I'm American\nBooks Sexton or else of course not right that that's just that's just silly that's just nonsense\nBut do you see that a lot of these other big journal ties that that some of these big oh if they really think oh my gosh without us talk of the republic time probably be better off that the real for that is one when Trump calls him out that's when they get so upset because again they probably would be a you know easier without some of these out what's out there\nI think some of them do act in bad faith and do spread misinformation and propaganda and and don't have a good eat those and an artful of honest people and I mean some of the big the biggest players in the space\nBut it's it's such an important thing you should always feel like anyone that you see in in media anyone in journalism especially on the TV side of the things they should feel blessed and lucky and be always exuding a sense of\nThanks and gratitude to the audience that gives them their job and the moment that they lose sight of that you know that that then you turn into one of these overpaid CNN cry babies you know the moment they lose that that then you start getting this mentality you see what you know the the Acosta effect\nOf like oh I'm just I I Want to U.S policy questions but first I Want to ask like what the president hurts my feelings and like let me just to the story about me\nThat that's the ... the Achilles' heel of the media Trump knows it and he keeps going after it and he should and that's why he keeps winning on the radio\nCan't help but feel like this narrative that just came out today oh yeah there were secrets of peanut for Trump they're trying to make some people out there I remember you know what I Know that this was all garbage you know what I Know that there was no Russia collusion that people think there was are\nDelusional and you know and all the rest of it but there are people out there there are people who are still oh I'm On the fence about this I don't really know and it and if they hear\nThat there's a secret subpoenas for Trump they may say wow I guess maybe there is something to that you know I'm actually going to go for the Democrat last minute I I think I'm going to cast my vote if it's a tight election I'm not really sure and you know I I Believe the rhetoric about healthcare and pre existing conditions that all that stuff I'm going to go the Democrats remember how upset\nThey got the media about ... saying that they were reopening Hillary's email investigation whatever that was a couple of weeks before the election remember how just oh my God it was so turtles unfair\nI think that they would feel completely justified in what is essentially a bad faith leak story like this meant to\nCreate the perception that there's more to the Russia collusion narrative than there is\nI I think that that's you know that's something that\nCould very well happen and you know I haven't spoken much about this uh this summer I think those are things that only journalist really care about but I'll just give me the quick in the quick and dirty on it so there was a a guy tied to the gateway\nPundits oh whose name is actually is keeping me right now but he ah what is this guy's name again I'd never heard of him before Jacob wool a twenty year old a twenty year old for right Internet personality who has written for the gateway pundit um he\nAllegedly tried to entice a woman to claim that Mueller and sexually harassed her in the most\nHam fisted\nStupid ridiculous [noise] kinda transparently\nObvious thing imaginable basically was offering women money to live out more\nI was going to get a report on the allegations are what I don't think he understood is that of all the people that you would kind of mess with right now if you you know that's I don't care who you are fake sexual assault or fake sexual harassment allegations are despicable I don't care who we are talking about\nWe don't lie about people we get them on what they did or you know what they are guilty of we never should get people anyone any\nYou know somebody levels fake sexual harassment allegations against Hillary why\nI wouldn't want that that's not okay I wouldn't be okay with that right we can get around all the other crimes she's committed but you don't ever put fake stuff out there but this gateway pointed guy or he writes for the gateway pundit he looks like he tried to entice somebody to lie about Mueller and that is not a bear that I Would poke let me tell you\nA for all the nonsense about Russia collusion how it's going nowhere\nMowers of federal prosecutors ... a lot of power I Will not mess with [noise]\n\nThe news radio I'm Brian should President Trump is

Wilson threatened and got a panelist on CNN like a fish so my plea to the e as if you're going to blame that Trump's rhetoric friend site and that they need to take a look in the air and think about the things that you're saying is well\nIt is an amazing phenomenon to have seen in the last couple of weeks and we've been talking about it a lot on the show\nThat there's a there's kind of a refrain a deal when it comes to media that you know they basically just saying that conservatives hey evil fascist races terrorists why don't we all just stop using mean words\nThat's exactly right they they I mean I think it was a perfect example of how the media talks about the other side on on Monday Night on his show he urged not to demonize people\nAnd that ... people saying that white people are responsible for terrorism in this country in the literal same brat\nSo these people and they talk about our speck in the other side and rationing down its course and being respectful but they're often

and do what you're saying now that was an isolated case no just few minutes later in the basement where the uh protesters had finally figured out the senators on coming through the main lobby they're going in the basement they were gathering there too\n[noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n\nIt just becomes like a strange church of protesters are really strange church of protesters and I think these lost\nBoys and mostly last girls don't understand the full issue they're not looking at facts they're only looking\nAt emotions and it really is frustrating and then moments after that was captured Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture and she walked into the the uh same hallway where the robots\nWhere where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nAre you how do you have in our will make I mean how do you find out how to do on that cap\nI Will be I Will be voting yes\nOn per se hit the final confirmation vote and I will announce my intention signed to how to vote later today than they\nDo Susan Collins earlier today before she delivered that epic address tonight who just some magical day and again I go\nBack to the discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes the salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I would've said you're on your mind you need to put down the pipe\nBut no that's exactly how this worked out Susan\nCollins gave such a brilliant and measured address today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet of what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she give a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady get fined for more than Thirty years why can only hope that the cabin uh I'm In age and it's where the press has finally hit rock bottom\nAgainst this backdrop sat each intervention well senator side what the constitution said price\nConsent to ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said\nThat he thinks next year\nTwenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court and with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative\nTo liberal advantage to a six three\nAnd that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would absolutely make everybody on the left to go nuts and they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be legal Armageddon for them\nSo uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan ... did today in your argument that she made her case\nWas to talk about something that the left would not let us get through\nAnd that was the presumption of innocence\nThat if you were charged with something you've used of doing something in this country we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence than it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nPrint some venison since relevant to the fight consent function when any accusation kept her\nFrom a nominee otherwise think sensory rat I worry that part of this recession could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and with the huge damage\nTo the confirmation process\nLiving for over some\nOf the allegations levied against judge cabinet illustrate why it hurts that innocence is selling for it\nI Am thinking in particular not of the allegations framed by professor for but if the allegations that plenty what teenager jets cabinet ... whole girls\nAnd use their we can stay ... gang rape\nYou know what's the most amazing here is it when you think about it\nThe apple collect the behavior of Democrats ultimately helped confirmed judge Kavanaugh and most importantly the absolute insane charges brought by Michael Avon not he\nThe guy that brought us Stormy Daniels or maybe she brought him to us\nBut Michael ... who tried to make this all about himself and his delusional dreams of being a twenty twenty presidential candidate ... brain for these insane charges that we're debunked within twenty four hours but still repeated by the mainstream media\nHave a ... may have driven Susan Collins to make this choice\nShe talked about this this wild delegation\nFish out last ditch alec gauge what's put forth without any credit supporting\nEvidence and\nSimply parish public statements stepfather\nYeah she's talking about the media should go after the ... too much you go to Susan Collins could have taken the media part but what she did was make a well reasoned well crafted\nAnd cogent argument for judge Kavanaugh by saying that what was brought up about him was totally totally without any credible evidence and certainly not even a preponderance of the evidence what a brilliant day\nIf he got a thought about that about

have ten people have been yelled at until they had to leave for restaurants all conservatives is that okay with you know I Am okay with Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nAnd Mitch McConnell yes Mitch O'Connell is more dangerous salmonella in that restaurant any why Hillary Clinton tried and I walk up you know but I\nIt's not clear that there was Hillary she leans recently being unpleasant\nAnd something being okay I'll take your protesting something you're disagreeing about you know I I if I get paraded children from their parents and I went to dinner at a Mexican restaurant I wouldn't ... high endorsed third term\nSo there you have the big separation okay I especially in a day like today where we're going to be\nA lecture by the left about about stability all of a sudden even mind that that exchange that was on ... recalls and show not tonight but last night uh that\nExchange was between a very senior and trusted Clinton Hillary Clinton aide Philippe Reines and of course Tucker who\nPeople will say looks like book so it's bucking took a or people say that I look like Tucker but they don't know if they don't know anything because clearly Tucker looks like me uh but\nThey're having a search engine you notice that that he makes it clear rains makes it clear that to him and this is true of many other Democrats are I Know the harassment\nAnd stocking and mob tactics of the left against politicians are people they don't like that is acceptable\nThey don't say oh sorry this is just some other thing you know this is just some other group that we don't we don't indoors we're not associated with this isn't representative of us they actually try to justify this\nBehavior and I keep adding to point out to people that the the line between these are at a restaurant and forty people were up in my face and I was with my girlfriend or my spouse or whatever or we're going to the family members or friends\nAnd people were cursing at me and yelling at me and threatening me the line between that activity and someone getting their nose broken\nOn either by me or buy them right I mean on one side of the other is that line is\nVery thin very small all it takes is one person who thinks they're going to give you a little ... of one person who just cross easily they're already screaming airspace they're already yelling at your restaurant there already embarrassing you humiliating you\nAnd trying to intimidate you\nYou really think that our for one of them to all of a sudden you know give a little shrug it a little push and things get out of control\nYou know the answer to that but what showing poured ears that the left or you know as shooters those idiots went after Nancy Pelosi I said in every other conservative but I Know and and respect came out and said those people are are more on\nWhat they're doing is a disgrace and not only is their behavior wrong by acting in that way and they they really did the progressive left the diplomacy wing of the Democratic party a big favor\nA boat oh by the way they talk specifically about that it rains 'cause they they have to pretend they're some consistency Rangel's say as he did a Carlson oh no that's okay what did it blows he's okay put Twenty one\nSo is it okay to scream at Nancy Pelosi until shall we ensure restaurant and the answer is no it's not okay I'd never okay I think what happened that she thought she was fine\nThe other day she was kind of a fundraiser and a group she was with her to do any you don't see anybody up and said Nancy Pelosi I'm going to yell at you until you leave the palm because you have a ... year shorter policy I disagree with [noise]\nI think an old person let's say you got to go out and that's not what happened was I Lived in such a shortage don't do it because they're not ... in the last ...\nLook I think needs to be done and I appreciate the Tucker set it and the Oh thank God that people like Doug or have the kind of plot for may do or they can push back on this nonsense no conservative we had a political culture and in our political culture in this country is unacceptable to\nMe you know surround people when they are engaged in private activity now they're saying they're in public but I mean they're not\nThey're not out of you know they're not on stage they're not and look I think the behavior when they're on stage is bad but it's just it's just different degrees right one thing if you want to make a lot of noise and heck oh people on Capitol Hill I think that's childish and stupid and you should get arrested but I don't think that it's\nYou know I don't I don't think it's necessarily dangerous to the people writing your Capitol police there and there's you know those cameras there but when you're in a restaurant and you think that you know ... where does that stop\nWhat about waiting for somebody outside their home\nYou know I Wonder where Democrats think about that can forty people wait wait outside your apartment in in uh on Capitol Hill or in downtown Washington DC if you're a member of the house the Senate\nAnd and they can they follow you can they follow every you go you know this whole notion of there in public so they can be a target of or did they now oh they're in a restaurant I mean I really get angry when I hear them a Democrat said things like\n... ... just you know enjoy their frog legs as I sit there at the table well people are losing their health care of and just as\nChildish talking points stupidity you\nKnow you're a lot of the older the ... the roast chicken while the poor people of America are suffering ...\nThey they try to create this whole narrative justify the whiny childish ... which is really a very\nCommon and very widespread characteristic of activists Democrats their whiny screaming children and they act out and they throw tantrums and then they want the media to tell them that those tantrums are okay and the media does\nAn important political figures I mean as much as you think he's got sleep rains arrived represents names important\nSo this is this is the distinction they're not hiding that they're okay with this behavior not only do they do this stuff and we really don't or at least we rarely our side rarely does they celebrate they endorse when their side is engaged in mob tactics and they really hope that the American people forget that\nBefore

who are Democrats that's is that with a CNN panel interviewing Florida Democrats\nAnd and you know this is one of the the issue is one of the problems the Democratic party's gonna have to find a way to deal with and that is they have all of these\nEstablishment politicians who are really ... you know they they just they don't go away they owe cling to power forever and they have no sense of of

wants more and I told you why the the Democrats the ... the whole mentality is that they have\nNot really accepted where or what happened they they haven't really accepted the Trump one that's why there's such a fixation on your coming up with some explanation for how Trump cheated essentially that's why there's some version of\nThat stuff and twenty sixteen that wasn't really the American people speaking out that wasn't the American people choosing something different for their leadership it was that the Russian collusion whatever whatever ... something doesn't matter what it is at this point you know something\nBy the way I I I'm going to be talking to\nOn rising tomorrow George Papadopoulos\nAnd and I got just becomes a ... where we are going to be airing it tomorrow morning Papadopoulos was the guy that they have built this whole narrative around that oh because\nOf Papadopoulos a that's why they needed to set up this FBI investigation I spoke to this guy ... the FBI and the department of justice should be show embarrassed\nThat this is a person that they thought they should bring all these resources to bear against\nThat he said that he had ... western intelligence agents\nSet upon him and try to and drop him I mean that that's he makes it very clear you'll you'll see it in the interview and\nThis is why the guy the guy got fourteen days in jail for you missed remembering the date of a conversation with Joseph ... sued you know the reason I was fourteen days and not for you know and not for years because everybody knows that it was a row of it wasn't even material fact didn't matter\nIt's not like oh because he lied about the date it change the narrative of his guilt or something else no they\nThey just wanted a hammer him and this is what we we are dealing with a mass irrationality in this country about Trump's election in in many ways and I know today's a particularly\nA sensitive day to talk about that but it's very much there it it it's part of the America that we're we're living in right now so I I just I just worry about that please do check it out the interview you were opposed to tomorrow you'll see it but\nThe interview that I was ... and you know we'll see what I mean anyway ... thanks is running again flows he thinks he's going to be next week or the house some Democrats are fed up with it but I don't think they're really gonna learn her lesson until Trump gives them a wall opinion twenty twenty maybe then to learn roll calls up next\nOnce a marine always a marine what if an American citizens are fed up with the

uh but what I Will tell you many others won't is that they're they are abusing the process\nRight now by their not technically illegal and I we all need to understand this if they show up at a port of entry and they're from Honduras and they ...\nThat they are incredible fear of their lives\nOr or the you know whatever the specific verbiage is that they're all using because they've been told this is what they should say they're not technically at that point illegals they will become illegals when they were led into the interior of the United states and they do not show up for their hearings or or if they're at their hearings they are\nTold that they must leave the country and they don't\nBut it's important we get all this right and they're not technically illegals\nIf they show up at a port of entry or even if they claim defensive asylum asylum laws are very the I shouldn't say laws asylum process is very favorable to anyone who shows up in the United states and and claims that they have

that thinks that if you were trying to\nCreate a lot of sympathy for the Democrats are and for the left right before an election that this sure that everyone is thinking that in the back of their

time in our history and Eighteen sixty one where\n\nWe distrust of the systems so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree we had such a disagreement about how our system is run we have a ... we had a civil war\nThere was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared

declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post\nAs to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary standards not the standards of Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there are major

all we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis and chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more than a year ago\nThere was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all it's just we're attacking officials\nBut this isn't registering and the media today the only thing that's registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain\nBut continued attacks on political figures from shootings to attempted bombings or part of a civil war tactic and it's becoming more and more pervasive\nThese are attacks on the Republicans and and the intelligence that are linked to these resistance they're using it for sympathy they're using on the Democrats were simply be the truth is Democrats are not unique Republicans are not unique in the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already having a civil war in this country\nBe attacks are happening to a lot more people than just the Clintons in Obama's there are

armed conflict civil wars on the other hand are are armed at times and at times they're not armed sometimes their ideological wars sometimes their spiritual wars sometimes there are warring factions

season hope you can join us this weekend is we take your calls about your home\nBut I can tell you this I Want to get to the bottom and if I Want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing this to try to make Republicans look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so that somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that now you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from\nOur authorities and the intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked but\nWe have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica as best we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to an end hopefully that's a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but\nNot an enemy we're all on the same team and the media not not\nCoast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's in turn them into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keeps keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nIn our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community the entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWhether it was somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again\nWill say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up way let the intelligence officials\nDo their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America you know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on\nJust the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but you have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it\nThey flew it most six more successfully and they protected\nFarmers than anybody in front of they sure did in ... and ... and when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America\nWe're on a good path right now let this pass continue and let's stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ...\nOr we will talk this week and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown

again and that's that's not right and fats but to have to understand ... light pole\nSo okay\nI mean a Bruce or Mike right I Want to bring you as an as an impartial observers here that you know you can tell it's a little there's a little bit back and forth but I mean there's nothing to do crazy there right now that was good at the conversation this is exactly the guy's a spirit of conversation and then things get a little a little more tests like Ninety\nThere was another tweet that said the Democratic party is comprised of racist white liberal that is correct\nAnd I write that flight well let's go back and and like fat well fed is that many people on the ... are not aware of what's called ... it's kind of social issues that I Am concerned about the color as White House um why why would you ask that question\nThat has to think about black or white like why would I get to a class at that's why don't you ask that question for that because they get there and I had about that\nBecause you're bringing a whole crowd that young African American leader so I sat there for something that I talk about ... light levels don't realize that you put on that\nThe way the economy should stay on our if it had like ... ... ... ... ... only on how they're going to crash it that way I look I I had a kind of social that way for how that will shape fall and I find that will shift away anyway I don't agree with that if I don't want to claim that scarlet federal\n... apple pie stabbing Chinatown up a Congress that surrounded by right [noise]\nYeah I felt like I got a little I got to look at their word yelling it was civil but I felt like a little bit tension there producer Mike yeah definitely it was fun I like watching it and I like listening to [laughter] see this\nIs this is a problem whatever whatever we have a say good like this\nAnd I'm like well that's not really the best of the show every like puck shut up people are fighting [laughter] I'm like well wait I thought I thought we were the truck tree I thought this was a mess that it I think we're all gonna supposed to like you know\nBlock slap each other and I'm not even ... there there was born there and I'm like okay because the control room 'cause it kept going beyond replay their their control rooms like we've got to go to break we got to get a break and I'm like okay we're going to break Chris was like no not done I was like damn okay here we go so uh yeah it was\nA spicy spicy wondering whether we'll get we'll get producer Michael one of these panels man that oh man my can we do that absolutely right yeah\nThe bosses would lead on that'll be the film that would be the same again buck I Know exactly what Mike Mike slaps will be like new truck bomb it like being left living I'm real quiet it on assuming tell them not yeah no no you do your your feisty and I know the Irish are I'm I'm ... I'm One one thousand Native American but I'm half are\nGood at ... or ... I wanted to make sure that we got producer Mike in with\nThe with the objective opinion there because you know for me it's like I mean I obviously ideologically agree with Candice I'm and and I I think that she's very talented and but I also am very ah very fond of Cristo even though I think that her politics or\nOr I'm\nWrong [laughter] so you know we were just it was it was quite an exchange\nThere and um we'll see tomorrow I'll give you a little preview later on in the show what the expectation is for a for tomorrow there might be I might be involved in a a shall we say more\nMore spirited discussion tomorrow of things I might be the one that actually has to do a bit of a a bit of debating but we've got a\nI don't we don't really have time to get the ... ... the funding to say the men that guys\nThat guy's been treated turban and certain says well we don't we we can actually do a little bit of it so I interviewed Papadopoulos weird this one today and here's what he said about the notion of Russia collusion play twenty\nGeorge what is what are your feelings now that it it has come out it's been a reporter here at the hill that there was an exculpatory evidence based on your conversation with an FBI informant that you weren't trying to do anything wrong that you oppose any trees in our collusion that that information may not have been presented to the Pfizer court what do you think about that\nOf course has for me it's a it's a very sad that it was I was impressed when John ... reporting but for me it was a sad day to see that uh that was not presented to the court\nAnd that in my entire image has been characterized by this false narrative that I Am some sort of patient zero uh about a Russian conspiracy and a a Russian a Coca Cola collusion conspiracy when in fact I have absolutely no Russian contacts whatsoever\nI've never traveled to Russia I don't speak Russian I don't even have Russian American friends are in this country so um when I found myself at the epicenter of this a conspiracy\nAs somebody who actually has no rush of contacts something just to not smell right at all to me\nGeorge Papadopoulos who remember when\nWhen it looked shaky on Carter Page you also had nothing to do with collusion or conspiracy running this stuff\nWith a look shaky them as the auto Papadopoulos that's how the FBI justify this investigation that that it was mostly Papadopoulos I'm telling you people who believe that Papadopoulos was part of some of some crumbling back conspiracy will believe\nAnything don't believe anything this is\nNo normal rational person could sit down and look at the facts talked to this guy and come away with thinking yeah that's right he was trying to throw a presidential election that\nEase utterly insane orderly insane there's just no\nRationale to write all other than it it it explains for some people or gives them an outlet for their anti Trump rage and anything that gives them an outlet for anti Trump raged they are in favor of\nSo if someone will tell them that there was a massive conspiracy to undermine the election everything and they have to believe that this total Patsy and I don't mean that a mean way seems like a nice guy\nHe only got fourteen days in jail we've got a felony on his record now which stinks owning a firearm no voting hard to get a job you know can't leave the country probably they usually have a travel restrictions he's got and and also I I don't like that when he talks to me about this there even restrictions as part of his plea agreement about what he can say publicly\nI don't I don't like that you should be able to discuss any aspect of your case once you're once you're through the system there shouldn't be a gag order on you know once your your\nCase has you know once you've served your punishment your case is done but there was one on him so it's that whole thing was just nuts and he was testifying today on Capitol Hill which is why we were\nTalking about 'em there but it's the whole thing is just totally an orderly bonkers bill um and I don't know how anybody can think were they were a year ago and this would just do quarter period or Papadopoulos employment but no no that was\nTotally orderly wacko let's talk about making Kelly getting fired what happened is coming [noise] folks\nDon't get caught up in one of those Tommy

[noise] excuse me in mockery\nAh that that would be offensive to some people I I get that and I'm I'm not\nBut I'm just saying that she is not even really taking a definitive declared his position on all the she's just trying to have the conversation\nBut because she veered away from black face under any circumstances is racist is wrong is terrible really any darkening of the skin is part of a costume is racist and wrong and terrible NBC\nJust I mean they had different anchors coming after NBC just fed her to the wolves on this one\nAnd then that led to this which I always find so depressing and and the whole thing is always so sad the Soviet style show trial forced apology\nI'm here is what she said in an effort obviously to keep her job one that was doomed to fail before she went on the air please play her apology\nShall I Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\n[noise] when they heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness at Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a percentage of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it as that was respectful and part of the Halloween costume it's pulled okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface being used an awful way by racist in this country it is not okay for that to be part of an old costume Halloween or otherwise\n\nI could have told her making a call me up and I have a little bit of a soft spot for her because she used to be nice you know started my career and having on her show and used to tell me that I was very talented and had a huge future and that I was amazing when I filled in for Rush Limbaugh and I was you know her favorite of all the Rush Limbaugh feelings and and you know\nSo I have a secret soft spot maybe not so secret anymore for making Kelly I'm going to be honest about that okay I Do even though I think that she turned on her people and made a horrible decision by going to NBC and was on grateful for the position jihad at Fox and all that okay fine\nI Would have advised her because I understand how this game is played now because I have to deal with it from both sides and no one's paying me tens of millions of dollars\nNot even anything in the universe of that to do this kind of work that\nOnce you're in this kind of a gym you can't you can't take the oh my gosh right throwing myself on the mercy of the politically correct to court oh my gosh please please just just let me keep my job I'm so sorry I'm so sorry because there has been a a very clear shift\nWe're now when you upset the PC police now when the social justice warriors come

know Trump's toning down the rhetoric I guess he's not such a bad guy after all I Know I I guess I guess we gotta let it\nEven though they wouldn't do that you know that's not what would happen that's

behavior wouldn't really matter to them\nWouldn't matter so I'm\nJust note that by the way you know one one little sudden I'll throw in there\nI've never really cooked bone and pork chop before\nAnd

children's book starting now you can make a difference just\nJust try to you know she she really needs more cash she lives in a ten million dollar apartment in New York or mom's worth a hundred million her husband is a hedge fund guy but you know what what whatever kind of cash grabs you can go and that's right having children's books ghost written for\nOh man oh man it's amazing\nShe Chelsea said quote I think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it match my talents I'd have to think if it's the right choice for me\nShe added she doesn't have any plans to run for office but it's something I think about as I Hope every young person thinks about first of all no I Do not want put put aside Chelsea Clinton for a second here why put aside or Chelsea and just know that not every person\nNot every person should be thinking about running for office at all okay there's there's a really very limited number of people that have to kind of a thick skin temperament\nSelf aggrandizing attitude and yes that feel called to serve but increasingly I think politicians are mostly megalomaniac um there there is an increasingly small number of people I think that really should do this and\nThink that everybody should I like this is where I Want to talk about term limits I mean this is just this notion that we have the political class that we do and they just stay in power forever is because the system is set up to the people that determine what the system is stay in power but maybe the\nConversation about terminals will have to wait for another time I just think that the Chelsea Clinton the notion that somebody would want to vote for this person who's never had a real job\nA and who was sort of let's not forget according to even some leaked emails was thought a very poorly at the uh you know the foundation the bill and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton foundation where she was supposed to be a a boss and a figurehead at the same time uh she was not well ...\nTo our border is pre position all the materials necessary to build a tent city I mean living quarters shower facilities messed facilities port a potties\nFood water betting clothing everything\nHave the grounds all staked out and ready for construction and bring in Sheriff Joe to supervise the whole thing along with all this we should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers that can be used as temporary courtrooms that have all the judges already there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this\nCome back we're three and three or four years for hearing bull crap or early on you know you're you're actually much more solution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because the problem is not that\nWe don't have enough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum\nThat's what they will do right so it's not a decision oh we need more people to catch them I don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border but think about the the value proposition from their side\nIf you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan you can either just tried to sneak in the United states free and clear or if you get caught then you say oh well I'm claiming asylum\nDefensive asylum is what they call it I'm I'm I needed a song and you will still get process for the illegal entry but that's a misdemeanor and they're not going to deport you for that and so you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even hear these\n... properly they're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against him they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling\nSo butter or in your ear at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a\nA a set up at the border where it was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh courthouse under the the eagles the eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so their take you write down there and you know\nYou get justice dispense right away you get your fine are you going to jail or whatever so it it sort of like that at the border would be what are what you can do so or when you're\nYou're on the right track my friend Bryan writes box still laughing out loud about trying to mediate discussion on the heated topic between crystal in Kansas we're actually well beyond time can just did an incredible job\nHolding her ground oh to be a fly on the wall pre and post that segment\nCanisters spheres no there's no two ways about it I mean she you know you can come at her with with everything you've got and I'll tell you look ... crystal from the left is also very tenacious so it was quiet and I can tell a lot of you that us all of us that it was quite a thing\nIt was quite a thing that ah that happens or by the way there's a rumor that junk weaker from the young church maybe there tomorrow and while I'm not planning to be in any way hum disrespect floor aggressive ah I have a feeling we will disagree profusely on some issues I have a feeling that could

and red lights on the trail a an edge of it and they flashing he could see later on in the site in a flashing bright red light\nOn the a dorsal surface of the object very interesting sighting after the first object to saw moved to the east towards Winston Salem reports\nHe realized that there was a second one above it headed a different direction added to the north instead of east and the second or two later you realize there was a third similar looking object in the night sky or make them in the morning and Scott this was six o five am\nOn Tuesday of this week the twenty third of October very interesting report and these provided for a very nice illustrations that are posted to our website\nThe third report comes from Rockford, Illinois a woman reports that yesterday morning at six

Love the show [laughter]\nSorry [laughter]\nI'm\nIndian blood in me [laughter]\nAnd then there's where my mother my I just you know we all I see you know I live I watch them hey maybe\nIsn't are ridiculous books I mean the left wants to lecture us about Trump and his decorum and his tweets and I'm hearing more and more from our swamp sources that they're the plan really is as much as I'm hoping\nIt's Hillary make\nAs much as I'm hoping it's Hillary the plan is going to be Warren for twenty twenty maybe Warren and then a a a veep ticket of either a Kamala Harris or maybe maybe Booker\nBut they really think it's going to be Warren and you know here's somebody\nWho is entirely unremarkable in her career weren't not for racial fraud racial fraud you know if you will lie about the assets you have in the bank to get a loan to go to jail you know a lot of trouble prison federal prison and if you lie about that\nYou get into a whole lot of trouble if you lie about your race in order to\nGet into a university or in this case to get a professorship at a at the most prestigious university really at Harvard Democrats as long as you told the line for them or are willing to excuse\nThe whole thing I mean it it should it Jim it's embarrassing and there's a middle is with Warren has now here's what's important about it to me well there's a lot of things but here's\nWhat I won't let go she has never owned up to this she has never said if she came out and said you know what I disagree with the racial spoil system\nI did this knowing that I could get away with it because I don't believe that this was ethical you know but maybe she could claim but I also think I have enough that technically I caught technically a qualified no\nInstead she pulled this whole high cheekbones thing and then we're supposed to pretend that somebody went to law school at Rutgers I'm not putting Rutgers down but you don't go to law school at Rutgers may become a professor at Harvard law you just don't unless you have a special angle\nI didn't let you have something to help you through and she'd never been forced to own up to this and the fact that the less I mean this is just like the NFL meal and\nSay you know Trump is incredible at picking means areas he he it really is like a political six sense that he has he knows that he can pick things that the less just get so fired up and energized about that they lose sight of whether it's a political winner for them or not\nAnd you know the NFL nearing for example the left thought oh and and these different players who obviously or kneeling are but the media narrative around this was over the players they thought that the players would went out and that all these teams would eventually allow kneeling\nAnd Trump kept poking at this ... you know you guys better stand shoulder because Trump understands that the end of the day\nA vast majority of the American people want respect to be shown flak Moore show them that love football people want respect shown for the flag Trump knew that he understood that and when he refers to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas he knows that the left\nIs going to drop it oh my gosh she's being a racist it why Pocahontas was a historical figure we all know from the Disney movie which\nWas by the way not one of the better Disney movies out there\nUh I was very ... and I'm somebody who really like the early Disney movies about era you know Lion King I beauty and the beach to a great movie\nThe original or will he gets on radio but the old school Robin Hood where he's a Fox so great it's a great cartoon if your kids haven't seen that one of my favorite cartoons cartoons used to be way better than they are now now there's\nA the cartoons are making for kids these days\nBut he knows when he called Warren Pocahontas they all go oh he's raised the jump on this but what what a lot of us who are just normal people who are not emotionally destabilize left is where we hear is\nWhy are they why are they defending\nElizabeth Warren being called ... where you know she's not a Native American right we all understand is so why do they act like this is some big slide against Native Americans the point is she's a fake she's a phoney\nAnd Pocahontas is a very well known female Native American in in our history you know there are others but Pocahontas was probably the most well known I mean you could say she's not the most historically significant I'm\nSure I'm about to get an angry email from somebody\nBy the ear record nation and how was that matriarchal society you know they were the basis for U.S Constitution\nAnd who there's some really interesting were vision is out there about\nA native peoples in America and how bad technologically and politically advance their societies where or when you have not mastered the wheel or writing it is tough to claim I think that the European columnist we're taking much of\nTheir political system more you know I I you know you can call me crazy but but with the Warren thing are we going or Pocahontas\nAnd you'll notice that one of the themes we're hitting on in the show\nThe left deserves to be mocked what has to be ridiculed if they were taken seriously they ... when they're being an serious if they are taken seriously there's no way we ever snap them out of it\nOr they need to be mocked in ridiculed and and brought down a peg when they're acting this way on these in these positions on these areas because satire is a very powerful\nTool it's very powerful a there's a reason why we still know the names of people like Samuel Clemens Mark Twain why we know the names like ...\nBecause of their ... it was there to cure a cold powers right in in their writing that were show timeless and and really resonated with people\nAnd you you must be willing satirized people like was worn must be going to point out the hypocrisy to the left has here\nAre like and that that she's even being considered that she's

... as the kids would say to work through\n'em so I just wanted to know the core Ocasio Cortez who was a darling of the left now\nRefers to leftists in her district as people who are having a psychological breakdown because of Trump\nI I'm not reaching what I point that out I'm not just basing it on their behavior and trying to mock them all that's fun to hash tag owned the lives it's also the case that they recognize that this is really that left ism is now a psychological disorder in the era of Trump\nUh but that wasn't even the ... the silliest or or weirdest things you said I got to tell you\nI've always there are some viral Internet clips uh that that are out there that you just never forget right there's the O'Reilly you know we'll do it live you know we'll do it live I mean

uh there's also the maps like such as the Iraq and the south Africa like such as that\nYoung woman you know very beautiful young woman and sprayed oh in a in a bad as the Miss America pageant a thinker and his team usa pageant or whatever it was\nAnd and she uh she got a little caught up in her answer and didn't really know what the heck she was saying and I know what that's like you know sometimes I've gotten really tired and an ... using the lovely young woman's ... of course right I'm excusing\nWhatever um but I Know I caught myself but Ocasio Cortez had a moment\nThat reminds me of that I just wanted to play this for you there's so much here this was on MSNBC over the weekend this is the favorite new Congress Congress woman of the progressive left\nAnd here's the kind of stuff that she offers up in terms of her analysis of what's going on with the Congress this is going to be delicious play clip on\nAnd you're also coming really as an outsider in a moment watching people like for watching what happened today and want to storm the gates and you're going to actually do that was a well that's what's what's your plan [laughter] well\nI think a lot of changing our strategy around without you know there's a lot of baseball and its inside the beltway as you say that turn out that\nThere are very ... organizers little Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if for some kind of strategy and what it is really about Oregon I vote\n[laughter] at work organizing restricts all they can learn we bring together a coastal strategy\nPressure on the shoulders of only focus on the shirt but she was really interesting thoughts [laughter]\nJohn did you that's really interesting I Love crusade you jumped into your ... or something [laughter] what are your router that was straight out of the Mario Lopez playbook for that quip because she was like thank you very much ms Tennessee likes to lead to do this like deep voice announcer man big after like such as Matt\nOcasio Cortez I mean that was\nJohn can you jump to the middle of that again just where she started talking about organizing can you do that because I I don't wanna hear the whole thing you did I just want to hear the oh\nOkay well close enough yeah it's like organizing is like like so what's different about organizers is with the organizing is that they organize and like outside the box and\nYou know close the loop on the organizing of the organizational I Am there's like the Congress with the organizers and they're just like so much of that\nStuff [laughter] she was I mean John I'm not being unfair right and that was one of the craziest word salads I've ever heard on television\nI think she was trying to find what you wanted to say yes that's right because she couldn't get to a point at various dude analysis I mean she she comes out and you're thinking to yourself like okay I kinda know where she's going she's a community organizer she wants to borrow from the Obama playbook of you know community organizing isn't just a way of doing\nYou know agitation at public agitation in pursuit of personal political uh goals\nRight it's not just whipping people up into in ... style mob there's something more to it than that\nBut then she just gets lost and she's ... she's she's looking for the articulate soundbite that's programmed into her mind because so much a progressive ism is really\nThis learn the language of trigger warnings and like hierarchy the patriarchy and victim allergy and white privilege and checking your privilege and there's this whole other lingo\nAnd these phrases that come with it and she's looking for ... you know she's looking to lock into that but she got a little lost and then you realize like she's not really thinking about what she's saying\nYou know this is like when Al Al Sharpton do this resists we much like the resist you know you realize he's reading off the prompt or but he's not actually thinking about the words that he sang Ocasio Cortez had us uh R. E. S.\nHe I see gee we should keep that as a we should keep it as a drop job just to have for you know important moments like this R. E. S. P. I. C.

Marxist and redistributing wealth and everything 'cause it makes them feel good about themselves they don't think of the economic consequences\nMy concern\nIs that we are going to have a structural economic reset because of the debt and because of the accumulation particularly of corporate debt load and you see that with all these these high you'll bonds that are ... and the corporate debt structures for some of these companies are never going to be able to actually make good on their obligations\nRising interest rates any massive\nYou know he didn't have to do any does he was a billionaire he doesn't have to do any this I I Do think that bears reminding sometimes\nOr whether we should at least take a moment step back and say you know he didn't he's not the Clintons he didn't do this to become rich she was already rich you're doing this because this is what he thinks needs to happen for the country and this is real he is in fact doing public service although he's not the kind of guy who refers to as such\nBut each show important that there's somebody now who will mock and ridiculed the left\nBecause there is a certain\nBreed of conservative something you might even be thinking about you know some names that come to mind but there's a certain type of conservative that finds\nMocking the last to be beneath\nWe should get knocked all the time we should be called you know racist inbred hillbilly beer drinking NASCAR drivers you know because we are concerned right and and so they paint with a really broad brush and they just make fun of us you know we're all a bunch of Bible thumping races\nYou know middle aged white males that the Republican Party the left and they just hammer that culturally all the time and we're just supposed to take it you know the old conservatism they're kind of Weekly Standard conservatism that was dominant in our media discourse for a long time\nThat's faded away now it's no no you're gonna make fun of us we're going to make fun of you know you're going there they made fun of Bush and said his eyes were too close together and he could use a Monica ones that have classes and he's an emphasis on all this stuff they did that for years and years\nPushing ever really hit back nobody in the UP really hit back McCain didn't really hit back Ronnie didn't really hit back\nWe actually need somebody who when ... when we see what the opposition is willing to do will will fight fire with fire these people are clowns polo seat and Booker and Feinstein and\nBlumenthal and just go to these people are jokers\nOnly it's not funny because they're really doing harm to the country and they're willing to destroy people into very\nDishonest things in the process you know and they're delusional\nThey deserve to be mocked they need to be ridiculed they want to step in public life not just conservatives that need to sit there and take it and deal with this any more and that's this is important my friends okay [noise] ridiculing what should be ridiculed in the progressive left\nIs not just a little sweetener that Trump throws in their free speech is we need more of this we medium to own the lives\n[noise]\nSay there's radio I'm Brian shook President Trump is saying he's sorry to justice Kavanaugh following a grueling confirmation process tonight the president honored Brett Kavanaugh at a White House ceremony he said Kevin ... and his family have been put through terrible pain and suffering Kevin faced accusations of sexual assault during his confirmation process\nFlorida governor Rick Scott is urging people in his state to take the threat of hurricane Michael seriously hurricane\nMichael is a massive storm that could bring total devastation parts of our state especially in the pan handle\nThe hurricane is strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico and is expected to make landfall along the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday the national Transportation Safety board is trying to figure out what could have caused the crash in upstate New York they kill twenty people\nState police major Robert pat not confirming the driver didn't have the proper license and the vehicle had failed inspection\nThat company and that vehicle have been under scrutiny of the ... in the past\nGiven the number of seats the vehicle was considered a bus not a little Saturday afternoon was misty and officials note that could explain the lack of skid marks also not clear if speeding was a factor NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt will be investigating all week engines in\nPart to push back into the front of the car certainly indications of high energy in fact\nIt's the deadliest accident in the country since two thousand nine Eighteen occupants and to pedestrians dead James ...

panels on CNN and MSNBC and said well we're going to have one person from the left on one person from the right and\nWe're going to try and keep it simple it's never going to be them all the people on

gym in Pennsylvania is checking in Jim welcome to the buck Sexton show tests due to my friend\nHey good to talk to ya\nWhat's ... what's your thoughts on the Korea and Russia situation\nWhile I think myself I think the reason why North Korea is kind of stall out and some of the other issues that we've had going on is because they're all waiting to see after these midterms if Trump is going to get impeached or add more problems because\nIf that happens when they're in the clear\nThere they will find we won't find anyone else to put up there that can deal with like Donald Trump does and that's what they are open for\nThat or just ... you're getting her feet and waiting to see what happens and and our media plays into that too because they keep promote and all that\nInteresting thought gym but I Do think a diplomacy on this level takes time\nI also believe as I told some of my more liberal friends who are profiting at the mouth going we're going to get the house and they were going to we might get the Senate and we're going to impeach Donald Trump and then we're going to get them out and I say you realize that meets president pen will be a reality and if you think President Trump\nHas been tough on liberals and on on people who are sticking it to America way to use the word President Pence would do and they were going to get him to who we got a plan for him to show I'm not sure about that I just\nI think diplomacy on this level takes time we saw progress in the Russia situation today with seven more Russian soldiers being indicted now they're never going to extradite him here\nBut Donald Trump's been tougher on Russia than Brock Obama ever dreamed he could be tough on Russia\nSo I I think it's about time and it's about\nTrump being blustery in his speaking and then the the uh the pragmatic approach has to go through all the steps of diplomacy to keep an eye on that gym but thank you ...\nLet's ah stay in Pennsylvania and ah see what's on Felix his mind Felix welcome to the buck sects than shows her\nHey Michael hey I was a big fan of Howard Stern back in the bank and I want to I Want to vindicate him when I went to college in Seventy eight Seventy nine and ... it was very comic to say that girls and women went to college to get the rest of the great\nWell I I understand that we're talking about uh let's go a decade forward and I don't know if the\nM R S degree was as much of a cultural thing in the late eighties and the early nineties as it was in the in the seventies and I think saying in twenty Eighteen\nA rather insensitive to the women today it's kind of insulting to women you I'll tell you what you go to a woman today a twenty five year old woman say why don't you just work out and get your eye Maurice agree to it\nBut what do you go back to that day I mean I Wonder if you go to school or in the early eighties right\nNow in the late eighties he was in high school in the ah that that was the whole argument about this she initially said this happened in the mid to late eighties and then she ... high school was eighty three eighty or eighty four\nFor him so he was getting out of college in the uh late eighties and I think a little bit different back then\nYou know I and I already had a female vice presidential candidate and the same time\nBut eh yeah I understand what you're saying you're saying a stern was making a reference bad but I'm Talking about his references to day you start talking about women getting I'm not exactly sure what that meant\nBut uh I think that was something we weren't supposed to

and explain this approach the law\nNow all of that has been wiped away by what he calls vicious allegations\nHe said my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted\nMy wife and daughters to face violence and violence threats\nAnd then the face of it all he got a little tense was suddenly called not appropriate\nDid not have the temperament to sit on

old fashioned way with a cup of tea in the morning flipping through the pages of the wall Street Journal you know that's one of the greatest papers ever\nSo I Believe judge Kavanaugh and I believe this this will also filter into the minds of some of the people who are on the bubble\nSome of the senators who have not stood up and said what they're going to how they're going to vote by the way senator Shelley Moore Capito\nHas said she is going to vote for judge Kavanaugh\nYour statement probably serving West Virginia and I wonder if this will put a little pressure\nOn a Joe mansion\nThe guy who's\nIn his job\nMaybe we shall see way she'll say there was something else I had to\nGet to today I Know a yesterday\nIt's about a middle of the afternoon yesterday we had that cast of the presidential alert system did you get yours it or to Eighteen east coast time I happen to be playing a little golf I sneaked in nine holes of golf yesterday\nAnd in doing so I was on the golf course in the middle of a back swing when I got my presidential alert message\nAnd it was loud and it was cool and I thought All right that's a good thing and then I saw what Michael Moore put out\nYeah that Michael Moore the big fat guy who makes movies who sometimes gets awards for his movies and he made that Fahrenheit\nNine eleven movie years ago and then he thought wow Donald Trump's election was on ah eleven nine I could do Fahrenheit eleven nine and go after Donald Trump and his movie has been a miserable\nFailure\nSo Michael Moore who believes he's one of the guys who predicted Donald Trump will get elected Michael Moore came out yesterday after the test\nAnd he posted this on Twitter quote it was just to test but make no mistake about it this is the world in which we now live close quote and then he goes on to tell us\nThat's the final line in Fahrenheit eleven nine and he has to tell us that because nobody's gone and seen the movie the movie as Bert virtually a losing money it it was a stink or from the first weekend it was released probably the worst failure he's had\nBut he said that was the last line in my movie Fahrenheit eleven nine a few minutes ago Trump gave us a preview of the state of emergency he is creating to justify the end of democracy as we know it resist\nAnd I'm just wondering what Michael Moore\nWould he be on happy if there was an attack and nobody got him a message or would he be screaming going\nNobody tell me nobody tell me this is getting out\nAnd I just wrote back to him I sent his message back\nTo him on Twitter with a note saying dude\nGet help I'm sure you have health insurance and I'm betting it includes mental health coverage as well stepping aside\nFor a second you want to weigh in on the Kavanaugh conversation we also

paying more attention\nUh and uh to my buddy a Randy Sutton with the law enforcement and so much to do and do you the listeners who've\nBeen there throughout the whole show really helped out a one more caller hanging out on the buck phone lines Kenny in Boston Welcome to the show Kenny how are ya\nI'm Mike ... kind of like a an obscure Chester you're all it just might give somebody it\nIt does but it's not it's actually it's a a maneuver that they the Romans used to use they would\nSay for tests don't know but they would say in Latin and uh they would take\nTheir shields that's why buck says shields high\nBecause when you inhale tests do do it meant to put your shields over your head and everybody would then form a like a like a tortoise that's what to do do meant in Latin\nAnd the shields would form this impenetrable barrier so the arrows ... spears would bounce off and they could approach whatever they were going to fight so that's why we yell tests do do and shield tie on this show beautiful\nListen I wanted to talk about the um\nThe test the FEMA tests the presidential alert yeah I didn't get one myself right before when I understand this has been in a in the works or expanding their time of Bush and that and it was expanded under Obama macho include cell phones but it only right now got a implemented\nAnd so this doesn't really have much to do about the timing of it seems to me you know like why now why did it's almost seems like they did not but the thing in Hawaii when they had that alert there and the\nAren't coming off the deep state thing but I'm a little bit of a um stretch there I suppose well you're\nRight when you do the history on it and say started under Bush and then it was approved under Obama and it's just sometimes a coincidental when discovering program finally takes action\nNow is it you know I have friends who say they must know something's going to happen and they want to tell us what what really bothers me Kenny is that now the government's got my cell phone number I already get four million uh unsolicited phone calls a day\nFor people to say did you know you're eligible for free back brace her neck brace push one\nTo get your information push nine to be on the do not call list and I used to push nine\nBut now I realize when I push nine all it says is they can sell your number to somebody else they can sell that number to someone else who's going to then call me ten times a day so I now push one and I talked to him\nAnd and I try and engage them because the longer there on the phone without making the sale\nThe I'm frustrating that so I'm doing it so you won't we won't get that call but I don't know that that ... ferry is\nUm you know Michael Moore thinks it is but I don't it just bothers me that now the government has my cell phone but they don't have yours you didn't get a call\nYeah there's I I didn't get finished reading it but there's an article on line and it says some people did not get a call now I did not get it\nWhen you consider yourself lucky unless there's an attack then you're going to be walking around and go where the health everybody going\nThat all of us\nYeah may maybe just might keep your eye on everybody else you you can't miss it like I said I was on the golf course in my phone's they're gone and ... or whatever was\nYou're not supposed to make the noise 'cause then I'll make a mess but Kenney a I got to I'm almost out of here the Soros machine is approaching rapidly quickly do you think Kavanaugh gets through or not\nA I'm going to give it about a Seventy

community they make they make decisions about adoption child custody traffic violation and mark this November educated\nYou know and treat the people involved like the metaphors and and ... and not based on the law are due process but just on sort of emotional lobbying\nAnd that's scary because that kind of weaponization of the population can take a very bad places you know I had to when the Gramm had a ramp during the\nDay I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population and increasingly allowed themselves to be weaponized so you know the reality is is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates pulled out its because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record\nWhat it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment the constitution\nSo I think he's apt to bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go and that's what's going to give some of the moderate you know problems and so but my guess he he's going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things that's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know in his tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if the um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\nAny any time any one of the things talk act supports the violation of due process um we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial

lawless process where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government people to frame me mhm and what\nWhat saved me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law\nAnd it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me so we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um\nYou know I think I think that a lot of the people uh you know who've allow themselves to be weaponized oh oh ah\nOh an apology to to everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think the leadership of the Congress those American apology\nWe shall see how this all

fastest hurricane anybody said it just was speeding if it wasn't that would be absolutely nothing left because I just spoke\nWith Governor Scott they're very happy effort is being now following hurricane being brought in a way of unbelievable large amounts of water and\nAnd everything that people could walk on the electric companies have been a terrific they're already working the roads are being cleared out many trees are in the path of the electric companies the roads are being claimed right now they're being a for the most part they're open enough to get the electric companies and and\nA lot of electricity is already back on some of the false electricity is already back on that's in Florida they're following up in Georgia\nSo the Trump Administration is showing competence and doing what the federal government can to help respond in a situation like this obviously it was really nasty hurricane it was a two and then it came up with category for wins move really fast\nA but one interesting ... first priority the first thought of everybody is getting help to those who needed and making sure that there's\nNo war minimum loss of life and they're going to lives lost so far but as we know it can often be the aftermath where much of the damage is done in terms of the human cost a but hurricane Michael a hit and you're used to be this\nI guess you'd call it a gentleman's agreement a gentleman's agreement among politicians that are when something like this goes on you will you will see the political attack ad that was not the case here folks\nAh you had Ron dissent is his rival Andrew Gillum getting hit with some uh some ads you had a the the democratic superPAC\nThat is trying to help Bill Nelson and Florida take down his opponent governor Rick Rick Scott they called them a shady\nMillionaire and the ad by the way John I'd like to be a shady millionaire that sounds like fun you know\nBeing a millionaire would be great but a shady millionaire sounds like you're the kind of a millionaire that has parties on his yacht and has a little too much fun so I think that sounds good to me but they're they're running into these attack ads um and and people were pointing out that\nThat this is a different thing than what you you would usually expect\nYou remember there was running attack at the rain jacket in the state that is getting just battered while it was getting better by this hurricane and they're running ads\nSpecifically on the opponents inability to respond to the hurricane so usually you wait for a politicization of these things and then with hurricane response is fair game to criticize politicians were I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics to fly into into literally the storm\nHas passed and in this case the uh the candidates running these ads\nEven while the while the storm was was overhead and people were trying to either batten down the ... or ...\nOr or wait until they can return to their home by the footage of it is just the devastation I I Know that\nYou know the the news channels because it's such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home what would it feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so when you see those images you're immediately drawn to it\nAnd I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with\nAll the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think also a illuminates how tight these border\nRaces are people are going to look to the Florida governor's race\nA and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the Senate race 'em and they're going to try to extrapolate from that for the implications for the\nPresidential race and twenty twenty you know the idea you're being a ... who's a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida with the policies are posing and he's one of these guys who's\nYou know if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be um but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic African American um and and that's\nWhat the progressive base wants to see in their new candidates they want to see you know minority\nRepresentation and they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives we we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nUh identity politics is a is such a big factor on the left these days but they

invasive ... having completed over forty thousand homes or their twenty seven years in business they built a reputation on offering a clean streamlined process for customer convenience\nIs eight ... information's come out that a team of about Fifteen hit men\nAre who were believed to be carrying Saudi diplomatic passports arrived on two private jets some of them are from NBS is personal security detail according to press reports including one who has an expert chief in autopsies\nYeah you can imagine\nAnd that the stories that were reading right now not entirely confirmed for the stories that reading involve a brutal murder of cause I I haven't read yet how but I I Would guess they probably you know tortured and and beat him to death\nA brutal murderer and then just remembering his body putting his body parts into bags and disposing of them in fact one Mideast based paper although it's\nIt's funded by the country so it's you know take it with a grain of salt one Mideast based paper claims they have a source telling them that the body parts of ... so the anti Saudi journalist that's been murder that's missing has now turned into this global story his body parts may be buried in\nThe residents of the consul general of ah of Saudi Arabia in Turkey so this guy's centuries of senior Saudi official may may have these body parts barriers backyard\nAnd this is crazy folks I mean this is if you read about this in a fiction novel you'd say come on\nThat so that's so outrageous not only is this not you know this is not the kind of guy you can disappear\nAnd I and I want to get into a little bit of well what does that tell us about the Saudi motivations are both the Saudis are saying what we'd expect which is of course you know they think that he left and they don't they don't they don't accept any responsibility for this and nothing happened this is all crazy conspiracy theories you know you could assume all that\nUm but and then that'll give it some of the complicating factors here but the Turks have\nPretty good intelligence and police forces\nAnd plenty of surveillance cameras and other ways of figure out what went on here and for the Saudis to do this on the Turkish soil instead of trying to lure ... back to Saudi Arabia if you went to Saudi all bets are off we wouldn't you know he would have just disappeared and nobody would know so they did this in Turkey\nA well keep in mind that a cause show he was a permanent resident of the U.S now he had gone into a a a self imposed a self imposed exile of sorts here in the states\nBut that the Saudis would do this just show brazen and now you have all these different politicians Lindsey Graham said there'll be hell to pay\nYou know I like Lindsey now is you know hey I like Lindsey did the right thing and the Kavanaugh hearing I'm I've always been okay with Lindsey Graham but now I'm I'm pretty pro Lindsey but people are saying is going to be held to pay a seems increasingly likely that the Saudis will just deny deny deny but\nThe overwhelming weight of the evidence is that this was a a brutal broad daylight you know ours assassination\nInside a diplomatic facility on another country's soil ... this is the kind of stuff that that you do cut off\nYou know relations with a foreign country for because they believe that this was most likely ordered at the very top of the Saudi Government or at least there was consent for given at the very top levels of government processed by NBS himself\nThis is crazy this does not happen and people will say oh by the Russians yeah the Russians have engaged in assassinations of critics and and but they they are tend to be ... former Russian nationals\nThey've done in the u._k. I Know but they've never done it in their former Russian nationals which this guy's a former Saudi national but as for Russian national and\nThey never do it in a diplomatic facility though\nAnd they certainly wouldn't send multiple private jets with Russian officials I'm not saying that the the Russians are to ethical for this they're just not so foolish as to do this but then you get to the ... the then you get to the book then you go to the point where you have to ask ... hold on a second\nTo the Saudis do it this way to send an even stronger message I often tell you on this show and are upset in the past that you know\nIt was burning dung village sends an even stronger message you know we're burning down the whole village and not just one house obviously sent the stronger message too but you don't have to burn down everything you can just make an example of one and here\nYou have a very high profile critic Washington Post columnist who was writing about all of the\nReally what what is a mafia state and the Saudis or a mafia stay with a religious veneer I mean there but Saudi Arabia is a is a a ... you know the ruling family has enriched itself to the tune of\nWho knows how many billions of I mean hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of of decades now Saudi families incredibly rich and the Saudis are as you know very repressive\nGoes all the way back to the unholy\nAlthough they would have thought it was holy alliance between the uh fundamentalist preacher on the Arabian Peninsula even Abdul how from the Eighteen century\nLeave he was born in Seventy two I think he lived about Seventeen Ninety two so liberal maybe Seventy eighty two so Eighteen century preacher who made this deal with the ... who were just warlords and that's how you get Saudi Arabia\nBut they merged together this religious or this religious extremism which is known as ... but they they don't like that term they prefer Salafis and Salafis means the forefathers of the a Muslim faith itself as it whether it's fundamentalism such Islamic fundamentalism\nAnd a ... law Mick\nLiberalism texture realism although even that is kind of difficult to decipher because if\nYou've ever read the Koran and there's a lot of\n'em but they killed that they've they've killed this guy now and it's going to cause some major problems on the international diplomatic so you know I'll get into why and what the what the end result of all this will be in just a moment we'll talk more about this\nWhat looks to be most brazen high profile assassination of a rush that that I can remember\nThey wouldn't be\nSocial media sites are the future of conversation my friends we notice I use it as a powerful tool and reaching out to you and spreading the word about the show and you use it among your friends and family to share your thoughts on everything that matters to you but\nWe've seen so much of the left wing bias at play in the last few years we know that Facebook and Google and these other massive social media enterprises\nHave all kinds of left wing conversational how shadow banning nonsense going on if you want to put a stop to that we've got a new site for you Snoopy dot com\nMaybe dot com is a place where you can go and share whatever thoughts you want you don't have to worry about moderators administrators suppressing your freedom of expression totally free to join check it out for yourself\nAs an I.

you need to know about home advisor it's a totally free service they instantly connected with top local service from\nAre an interesting side of that you won't hear I think on any other show ... has\n... is not it look he was murdered it was terrible but just if you want a little more background on him he's actually very pro Muslim Brotherhood he's very pro Islamist he is not a liberal in the western sense of the term and an off in western journalists make this mistake they think that just because somebody\nEasy on board with the uh old school\nMideast strongman authoritarian regimes that they must be you know pro democracy for women's rights in fact the show he was very opposed to democracy\nUm he wanted a I'm Sorry they're very opposed to liberalism\nYou saw democracy only as a means of instituting sharia um he was somebody that that believed in using the Democratic process to achieve theocracy whereas what you have in Saudi Arabia is essentially Salafis and without elections he wanted Salafis them but people voting art first\nAs you know once you get to that uh once you get to that place of of having a theocracy elections tend not to last very long in any meaningful way because you don't have the civil society below them to allow for the kind of conversation that would result in democratic process he's been meeting for\nSo ... is not this liberal reformer that a lot of journalists you talking about not not at all but he was a critic of the Saudi regime and you know you have this geopolitical reality and then there's the another reality\nWhen I can say here but I can tell you that a lot of places you won't hear much criticism of this you won't hear it talked about as a story even the Saudis have\nReally spent a tremendous amount of money\nInvesting in media in this country major corporations they're huge shareholders and major corporations\nAnd they also have invested a tremendous amount in some of our most prestigious universities so they have an influence in cultural and information based institutions here that allows them to mute criticism\nAnd that's something that we should all be aware of the Saudis have bought into American American media in ways that lets them call the shots and you won't hear talked about 'cause they're caught a lot of shots\nThey've written very very big checks and are not shy about throwing their weight around on these issues so keep that in mind because when you look at what's going on with Saudi and you look at how friendly all\nAdministration stretching back really for a century now in America are to Saudi Arabia [noise] it it's remarkable and this is\nThe argument the second most totalitarian state on the planet and we act like they're a bunch of good buddies of ours\nAnd it's just for reasons of short term

a federal this that she than a centrally refuse to pay\nAnd it has since moved into obscurity Africa they did some update on to wanna Brawley a few years ago and found that she was living somewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation settlement that she uh she lost so you can imagine when you hear today from people saying oh are you\nBlaming the victim well the court blamed the so called victim they're these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim are survivors we found out\nBut what let's say focus for a moment on they stop and frisk point because Trump brought this up he gave a speech what was the road and a weak mentioned stop and frisk or Chicago and here's what they say about this\nThey will claim that New York the most visible single place do have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was we know from today Democrat Bloomberg\nWas Democrat he was an independent member remember when he used to do those those uh those speeches about the snow and then and then they would they had the interpreter\nAnd and and but Bloomberg would go into a little like he'd be like ... Mayor Bloomberg God Bless that and you all you do as little Bloomberg Espanol ... I I\nThat was great that was great those are similar tires producer Mike Mayor Bloomberg would slip into his hundred words of Spanish that he spoke in order to just let it let New Yorkers know\nThat the euro\nThe snow is cold and they will move it we we wrap you know that was only a scene the lousy economy\nI Know we we didn't know we had\nYou see the ... by the way he says the mayor of New York city in case anybody a needs to be told that\nA major city hit somebody corrupt bill was talking about housing for homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean that work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\nIn cars you liked that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess for our we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real\nLotta stretching it a lot of electrical\nAnd you know ... when somebody comes up to him in the gym is a public official\nHe gets all Snoopy about it he's a he's a sniffy system the man anyway um I just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he was the one or he's going to run as a Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty race\nHe had stop and frisk what a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on a reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down\nNow they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have\nA large number of these stop and frisk hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you had a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic males who were stopped and either talk to or poor padded down looking for weapons and some people say it's racist\nInteresting when you actually crunch the numbers on that you find out that as a\nAs it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall into the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped flash\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that you know it looks bad and the and then they they point to the fact that New York is in a crowd and continued downward trajectory on crime but is that\nFor America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know there's just like showing up in\nIn the in the final stages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like wow it was already happening in the crime was already happening\nThe only point I think that's very fair to make on this is that conservative a lot of ... to stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of the background on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAnd the ACLU types and all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing about to stop and frisk and Chicago nobody had any ideas for how to make Chicago a less crime ridden place I mean that the number\nShooting people think of ... and I looked at it obviously is going to get the most headlines because when you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed\nOr you know more than that it's when we get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weakens with forty fifty people shot you look at the number of shot it in the low it's in a low salaries in Chicago all and people getting shot or stabbing a given year that's a lot of people\nThat are getting shot no one has any solutions or any ideas for this all I hear from lips and I get to talk to them when they come on on the hill TV show\nOh you're from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school at come on this isn't serious but they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that\nYou know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we\nAll the studies show that the the biggest single German or whether a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are in a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be and that when you control for intact household meaning you know a a mother and father both in the household\nThe crime rate is essentially the same across all uh\nAll all cultures and all ethnic background so you can have the structural conversation about why this balance the place of Chicago and you can't talk about more aggressive police and they say that's racist and at\nThe end of that this is where you see one of these liberal policies that they think they're being do good or is there protecting civil rights of minorities but you're just going to have having more people getting shot and they have no answers to it and that that Sharpton he's running around and demagogue ing well\nAs sharp as what it does struggling runs around and and demagogues on things but that that he's willing to do it on this issue with so little pushback from any one of the media just goes to show you that some of these old paradigms just ... just don't go away you know liberals would prefer to call Republicans\nRacist and sharp and to to say their dog whistling then to seriously consider a proposal that would save lives and this was the there was a breaking point in New York you know Giuliani came in\nYou know a numbers ... numbers based policing a ... that all that was done\nAnd the liberals were howling and shrieking or that too but then they realized oh you mean the city is going to be a lot safer I Hope the same thing can happen\nFor Chicago I Hope they managed to get this violence situation under control that are not going to hold my breath because Democrats are in

believe anybody can predict the future as you know I'm very consistent with that I think that you can you can have some fun with your speculation on prognostications especially as a political pundit because no one ever forget your losers producer Mike it's like the secret of being a stockbroker just got to make sure you focus on your winters meant\nIf you're right fifty percent of the time but you're really charming guy who tells everybody about all your winters\nVery successful stockbroker only members of losers don't pay enough attention so\nIn politics same thing it's got to make you

know buck is to shape public opinion yes and in a way off and as\nWe get closer it gets more realistic so the pollsters don't look like fools\nAnd they're going to win anything over as it was\nThen they turn and say well you know we got so many more votes in California than you did in these other states together that is not the way the campaign is here that's not how it works\nYou know nobody

right I mean if they could I think they would rewrite lots of rules I mean look we were only the place we're in right now with the Supreme Court because\nHarry Reid decided to get rid of the filibuster is it surprising to anybody that when they had a majority they decided to ah switch things up no but then they act surprise that what we have a majority we use what they use or rather we

to me once but it's it's an important point who told you come into the world to be happy\nThe answer is nobody really we are led to believe that by the society around us especially by the more commercial and a self indulgent aspects of the society around this now because we live lives of what would have been inconceivable comfort even even\nA hundred years ago really in terms of our day to day needs and and all of that um but that does not necessarily make somebody happy does not make them feel hole and happiness is not just about\nPleasure that's really where the that's really where

fallen\nBy the wayside so maybe that's something that I can raised with my team and say hey\nI've got an idea rising a pod cast maybe we should go for that um but the most important thing is that all of you listen to this especially those who listen on radio no but you can always listen on demand and that we try to get the podcast up a\nAs early as possible usually these days ... she'll be ready for you're listening enjoyment by six eastern maybe seven eastern each day so we're getting up earlier and earlier all the time\nOr Timothy writes shields high bucks you ask for a miracle I give you the FBI Hans Gruber in diehard affirmative action\nAt some lighter fare mixed in with the heavy duty news I had to listen to a I had to stop listening to Wednesday show when you're discussing the

and I know some days\nThat trust me it really affects me Sunday's New cycle it feels a little bit like\nJust getting beaten down by the whole thing is especially when you have these stories of of

mosques\nOh because it it should concern to solve it you know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons uh and\n... to Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates\nHow China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology um that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states\nYou know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Would ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders and Peter the great\n\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nAs you know really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that uh they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponized everything against us you know if you look at political corps and a predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard\nAnd there was a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in their defense ministers just met you know for taking time over the top\nSide for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick up on the other side alliance of evil lieutenant

lead sound like it sounds like in Saturday's shooting and I paid for a synagogue nature's NHL or to the nation's top policy interest as Robert Bowers and they paid the ultimate\nI think that they decided that their brand is that they're going to be the most shrill anti Trump lunatics on TV and that's a very crowded space right now is you know that's not an easy thing to be number one it\nOh and the drama they bring to the table I mean they ain't I mean imagine if you look so miserable they've noticed that when they're on air how happy they look yeah well you know generally like to go through life buck and so I start to things I'm just putting a ah\nJust putting that out I Know I Know I Try not to go to personal but you know\nThat that's not a good thing that I'm not a what's the word bad karma yes bad karma so speaking of 'em\nIn here but you know she because I was like wait NBC CBS they're both networks other than that they're both full lives but CBS had this uh the second each in taking down hate speech and\nThis has been one of the issues that has you know I've been talking to you about for a long time here where we know strictly on the left of oh you've got to get rid of certain kinds of speech on line\nUm and and you're not doing a good job of it and then we find oh and that they're just going to use this to shut down conservative statutes shock\nNo one oh but that's what ends up that's what ends up happening a time and again and so they they they can't get the true anti Semite off line they can't get ISIS and these other groups are to be\nTaken out of their face but they would they can do is is all of a sudden have second a pro Second Amendment groups that find their Twitter accounts or their Facebook accounts the activated but here's part of this a discussion and I have a slightly different view of this in terms of what the actions of these platforms should be play clip Thirteen job\nYou can be radical online\nOnline has already been supported by\nThat we believe that after nine eleven when people had access to ISIS supporters and if I played it individuals we know now that Facebook Twitter and YouTube all had agreed with that and have worked with the government can take a lot of these videos down why not when it comes to right or left wing extremists on line\nWell for one it's very hard it's hard to identify what is extremism it's hard to identify what exactly is hate speech words are very complicated and different context in a particular case of Bowers\nYeah ... it's very easy to identify what he was doing he should have been found that should have been taken down but as a general principle it's very difficult to identify what of hate speech what is not hate speech and is that foreign policy is on that\nIt's difficult to them any leeway on this issue it will invariably be used to the\nDetriment of conservatives in a situation where conservatives are the ones who find themselves the rules will certainly be much more strictly enforced against the right if they're enforced against the left at all and and here's you know a very good example of exactly what I'm Talking about is the fact that Louis Farrakhan\nStill has lots of social media are still is able to view his hatred and tolerance and this is also why I just find so much of\nThe media's\nEffort over the weekend to try and create this narrative of right wing extremism is responsible for all or almost all of the anti Semitism in this country when that's just not the case not the case at all and you know here are the kinds of things that Farrah Khan who\nYou know gets deposed in photos with Rocco bottled journalist hid that in the public because they didn't want us to see what was really going on there are but Farrah Khan is still treated as somebody bought Avon does have a boy he's not the platform he's not pushed off of all the different social media outlet but here's the kind of stuff that\n... fourteen and one\nWhere you recognize the\nOne where you and the synagogue of Satan which has many\nRaces in it\nBecause they\nThink about what they're going to say\nWhen they have been so\nAnd come on mad\nWhenever you read that God\nHas told the Jews to hear and obey and here and I did oh ...\nOnly disobeying\nPretty gross pretty clearly anti Semitic the state panic Jew Farrah Khan says\nHe's still somebody that prominent Democrats can hang out with an public can can speak with whether it's commentators or politicians or you'll notice that you don't have Democrat presidential contenders asked the way that the way the Republicans were asked about\nDavid Duke a loser that nobody cares about nobody you know gives it you know what to hear from all Republicans have to be asked in every presidential cycle will do do do do do just about David Duke\nWhy is it ever Denver oh do you disavow Louis Farrakhan why wasn't Brock Obama asked you you disavow Louis Farrakhan why wasn't Hillary Clinton asked circa\nOh that's right you mean

to get written out of the show according to reports from last because uh you can have well a couple of things right he's a an Indian a quickie Mart owner in store owner\nAnd you you can't have you know Indians and seven eleven you're you're not allowed to to have that stereotype anymore in pop culture and media where we've talked about you know the the war on a pool before\nBut now they finally decided that it's not just that there there were some concerns or some\nIdeas out there that they were going to voice a pool 'cause Hank as area who is the uh the guy who wrote voices and that was a white guy\nYou know the whole lot of voices he's a voice actor but he's a white guy voicing a brown guy which is obviously on this for the social justice love it's a big no no but they're actually just going to\nOr at least the latest warning I saw as yeah that's right there are writing him out of the show\nSaying that uh you know that that they're running the show now some people are pushing back on that saying that it's not true that he's not being written out of the show and I I think they are responding to back last year because people were hurt is now\nNow you you can't have this cartoon characters been around for Twenty years and and I would note a pool is yes he's a stereotype\nOr on the show for sure there's no question right he's a stereotype\nBut he's also not ... you know he's a family man is a successful business owner I really mean that I mean it's not\nHe's not often used on the show to highlight the silliness stupidity and ... of other people whereas you know he's actually concrete got a nice wife you heard or on the than the when we came into secondary got a whole bunch of kids he's a business owner I mean you know what a lot of people aspires you in this country for themselves\nAnd and he's not you know there's this big difference between laughing added laughing with\nA pool is I've seen enough of the symptoms of the many episodes certainly not all of them it's been on for one they laughed with character\nYou know you're laughing with it and you find him funny he does insightful political commentary yes he has an accent and yes there is some stairs it's all being used for the purpose of not just entertainment but also a inside and I just think that they're being really unfair to the character but I I Would say this\nYou know over the weekend 'cause the political correctness thing everyone hates it except for the twenty percent of the country are so that are just social justice left\nManiacs everyone hates this cult of political correctness this idea that we can't laugh at anything anymore nothing is allowed to be funny anymore everything has to be treated with this you know this deadly seriousness and just being normal people ah who can laugh at things that a normal person would find funny\nWe all reject this but we find ourselves still stuck in the totalitarian psychological prison all the time of the political correct speech and and thought police but I I I'd rather than get rid of a food than just\nYou know do what they usually do which is either take the character and remove any hinge of humor from him rights\nAnd all of a sudden a pool is going to have like an English accent and be a Harvard professor and just make fun of like the stupid fat\nWhite people like The Simpsons carrot you know that that's one way that they would go or the social justice warriors would want this to go a ... and in another way that they would go in to make social justice you know to make more social justice related points\nYou know now all of a sudden the food so I just I I don't want any of that you know I just get rid of this character then destroy the character I I think that's a\nThat's one movie silver linings holding but it's just indicative of how I don't even know what what anymore because you know it's going to change in a year and not based on humor but based on what is acceptable based on where to left wing draws the and something as\nAs really honestly durable and the comedy world as the Simpson has been around for decades their college are on the social commentary in The Simpsons believe it or not that's a real thing and The Simpsons has really stood the test of time when The Simpsons isn't safe anymore that then you little out there that I find funny\nIt so often the case that humor is now blended with political comments is it's a it's a cheap and an easy way to try to build audience right away what you do is you say going from the left that you hate the right people and then there are more jokes are funny I mean this would be able to Amy Schumer she's not funny\nShe just plays the politics right and people pretend like she's a comedian she's not a comedian she's

powerful that you no longer have any individual you have whatever the state Danes to leave you um but I suppose I'm getting\nToo deep into this rabbit hole a here's what I Would say about oh wait we've got more social Trump will actually say what needs to be said here which is that Hillary's a loser to John loser for president never really done anything impressive in her entire career has just been writing her husband's coattails\n'em and crumble said other people right the Romney wing of the GOP Romney wing of the GOP is much more\nWilling to sit back and take these nasty comments from people like Hillary Clinton much more willing to sort of take the the underhanded and unseemly an unfair critiques without punching back in any meaningful way\nSo a Trump is a new era for

way\nOf doing politics um he said things like you get tired of winning we're certainly not tired of winning\nBut that's not just a slogan you win or bad things happened to me you know if you believe for example\nThat the Democrats pursue immoral policies which certainly in the case of a roe v Wade and there are other things you could power right on top of that then there is something of a moral imperative to do at least everything you can within the political system to prevent them from having the power to enact there will\nUh but Hillary\nHas gotten in the past as we know from the media for

isn't\nA Bernie Sanders I I wanted to get away from the whole un climate change topic 'cause there's there are so foolish but they're so devoted to it\nNot just because of what they've been ... planet that's there there's a whole nother component of this discussion which is that they think that climate change that pushing climate change hysteria is a way to get\nCloser to a one world government and and I know that's that sounds like crazy talk but there's also why ... why didn't liberals have such an affinity for the United nation the United nations has proven itself ineffectual\nSo many times over at its core missions\nUh it it has not prevented genocide despite UN Mandate to do so it has not prevented armed conflict despite you know un efforts to do so and it often give some of the worst\nMost offensive an odious regimes on the planet cover for their activities because you know Libya will be on the human rights council or whatever\nYou know that they they have this fall the notion that all nations should be treated as somewhat equal\nWhen the truth is that there are some there are some there I say crappy governments out there there's some crap hole governments and then there's some pretty good governments or at least in comparison to the other governments pretty good oh and we shouldn't have to treat them all like they're the same but Sanders year when he talks about promoting a shared prosperity\nAnd solidarity that goes beyond any one nations sovereignty\nThe now now you're getting further along into what the progressive and state is with regard to climate change and and these activities the the fixation on multilateral isn't that you see from a body like the United nations\nI that's why I was all because they view the UN is essentially a democracy of countries and democracy is a is an almost fetish eyes word among the left because they think that democracy is an idealized state of all people being equal in all ways\nWhich of course interesting to me is somebody who is a it has an interest in\nAncient history and and western civilization is if you go back to the ... the earliest democracy or ancient Athens in Greece or they only had a very small percentage of the population that could vote you had to be a landowner you can be a slave there was a whole\nI had to be male obviously going to be or you had to be a land owning a resident of it would essentially be the upper middle class or the upper class to be able to vote in Athens in a very small percentage overall so you know the notion of democracy as just everybody gets to vote and they get whatever they want by whatever the majority\nAre ... by whatever the majority says that\nIs not really anything that will be a good government system you can imagine that extrapolating ... even further to what Bernie Sanders and others want here which is all the countries of the world gets a vote on things and then we are held accountable to what all the countries of the world want I don't I don't want to be responsible for what\nIn any way I I don't I don't care what European nations think about\nWhat my rights should be I don't I certainly don't care what Muslim nations thing my rights should be I don't care what the nations of East Asia think my rights should you know I just go down the list I don't care\nI Am not in any way bound to their notions of uh my protections in in

right now I Believe in a civil war\nAnd it's time to stop saying that it's not happening because it doesn't affect you directly it is happening the media is playing into it social media is playing into it and just because it hasn't been declared we can say that isn't happening here it is happening here\nThe civil war we are in now\nIs that two sides fighting against each other even though there are two sides but liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\nAnd that is that that is the main fight\nBut what we're saying if somebody is asymmetrical we're seeing something that's a patchwork of affiliated in surgery or insurgency groups\nAnd we have counterparts engaging in fights in skirmishes along overlapping edges of other networks that are demanding your support and your attention occasional ... and then this leads to occasional high value terror attacks windows terror attacks happened there turned into political radicalization points\nAbout things like gun

one asked me to join the war no they're not going to ask you to join the war that are going to ask you to pick a side because the war itself composing\n\nAnd the thing is if I say one thing we so

no official or to be called\n\nThe wars were then all of us were angry about everything what radicalized about everything we have an opinion about everything that doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even healed\nAnd the aftermath of course is when we identify the war you're not going to identify it during the war you're identify it after the war and that's what historians do\n\nWhen you take a look at all of the things that we can say we're a little skirmishes ... and little ideological or fights we had Charlottesville\nBerkeley Las Vegas and what's going on here in my my city is it is just it's\nTerrifying\nAll fronts aren't territory and we're not fighting for territory we're fighting for ideological or ideological superiority\n\nJust as we risk missing the signs of networked violence\nThinking in terms of classic civil war can blind us\nTo the many actors working to disrupt the United states from within and beyond our borders we heard Carlos talking about the rough childhood the cirrhosis of the word world we got a benefactor's provocateurs Olive Garden plutocrats transnational credible criminal networks we have\nA Islam we have a border skirmishes where you have ever has Thirteen we ... I mean we have everybody\nWants to come here and disrupt the system this is why are you know we always hear about Russia provoking anger this is why George Soros is always the guy that's being said well he's funding move on these funding all these other groups\n\nNow if you can think of all these characteristics if you think about how we're all breaking down into like these tribal segments and now they're fragmenting everything you can see that this is what a modern civil war looks like\nMore sporadic and unexpected conflicts but with fewer deaths\nFactions prodding like mushrooms taking different forms but coordinated across invisible networks waves of information warfare\n\nOr seeing chaos accelerated ... accelerated bizarre of violence in all kinds of I mean look\nWe have a healthy immune response obviously for the local and national authorities\nThe goal of the civil war is not death but the fragmentation of the republic the goal of the global assist or will America down to a

I mean she was a strongly high ... profile I'm ... I'm UN ambassador in part because she was a governor of his state to more of an executive function so\nShe certainly extremely opinionated in into the uh you know the Trump you\nKnow kind of foreign policy in line to AT T I mean I I think you know it's not surprising to the extent that Haley may want to follow the path of perhaps the person that will replace her who is Dina Powell Powell is resume reads like somebody a hundred years of age or even though she's forty\nFive she was with the administration now she's with Goldman Sachs investments for\nWell I mean not only was she with this administration she was with the Bush administration ...\nYou know she started off in turning with Kay Bailey Hutchinson and went to Dick Armey I mean this girl really knows how to move and shake and I think if they can wind and you know she's an extremely close associate of a bunker Trump I think you can really\nUh uh uh ... uh diminish or discount the idea that that are evocative Trump is going to take this position she says she's not going to\nKnow and she's not at all but I I think if they can can cajole or you know twist Dina Paulos arm to take this\nIt will be far better than Margaret now here's the current ambassador to Germany or this girl is God you know she's got all electricity about her and I I mean to wind up managing partner at Goldman Sachs without a bachelor's degree in finance she's I mean how do you do what George how did these people\nWhy am I I Know it's crazy but let me ask you this John because I Know you've been a staunch supporter of this administration have you ever seen more up ... in two years with members of the cabinet or his own staff\nThough I I think it's pretty safe to say that ... there's the turnover rate here is a you know a unprecedented on the other hand you know you want people when they are who are you know better and brighter type folks I think Haley was an outstanding UN ambassador\nAh and I think she just had enough of it I think that you know that's a really tough job especially today and you're just button heads all the time I think she wants to kind of move on to other things and pass the baton there was some speculation that you might even run against Trump but you know this is just absolutely hogwash\nThe likely scenario is that she'll probably be Trump's campaign manager in two thousand twenty I mean she completely

but Google Plus will be no more but it took more than that being the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus accounts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lauren\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus for Google Plus\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago I'm\nGoing to be missed what it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been\nVery happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run Google decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or\nHis book so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people to come to regret it given what's going on\nBut sizes everything with social media scale is everything at Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\n... of the right at the top of the currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't if they found that in a during a if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it was a theoretical bought her a bit\nBut apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that while the stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why are there things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why they're petition\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and uh it would have been a lot better off if they had\nIn the meantime all of a food but he was a group of all these years of trying to find other places to go or experimenting with other things that are mentioned that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head\nUsing of that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably about a good idea of the first place and that the time at ... at the end at the time it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out\nBut as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious wave to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question

more difficult thing to do usually whenever anybody asks me what's going to happen in Washington I'll say my general prediction about politicians is what's the easiest thing for them to do 'cause that's what they're going to do a this was not the easiest thing for Jeff like to do the easiest thing for him to do would be just a vote\nFor a cabin on to get him out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as it were basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to decide\nSee I investigation and that took whether or not you agree with it that was a gutsy thing to do it because it made every Republican in the Senate mad at him\nTapper is the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThese Steven cold there show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThe reason he did not was that he could not take the heat\nThat's not courage that is actually the opposite of courage that is called cowardice but notice how this has framed\nThey're trying to you and this is very oh tap are very establishment news media they want all the little senators that are still in the mix they want everybody who is perhaps persuadable on this one when you get to the final vote process\nThey want everyone to know that you know the ones who wants to stop this process or the brave ones let me tell you what Jeff lakes calculation was Jeff Flake really really wants to be liked\nBy CNN by the New York times it's adoptive these are powerful cultural institutions and especially if you're no longer going to be a politician you want in your day to day life you be thought of well by people who have large megaphones who have cultural influence and also by the way\nCan pay you a whole lot of money to do a whole lot of different things that what you want\nThat's what the self interested person is going to be concerned with first and foremost\nLike didn't show courage not the harder thing to do he knows this is a scam he's not a complete moron and he knows\nThat if he were to have gone along and on the right thing he would be in tremendous hot water right now with the left with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself\nI'm Still not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process who when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen\nOr East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the lead again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know that they can kind of accept him\nHe will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that made sure that there was this ... investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham and flake knew it was a ...\nSo what did flake do why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowardice because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a straw roast funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day than what he had already said in the morning same day\nLike is a self interest in power in this whole process and that won't change even if you vote for cabin on the ad because what he's done is just created additional risk for a man in this case judge Kavanaugh who has been ambushed who has been smeared who has been slime\nIf you're a person of honor and integrity you don't allow that to continue when it's in your power to stop it that's what Jake Tapper doesn't understand apparently it's what Jake Tapper does know yeah there was a hard thing for me do it was a hard thing for him to do for the few days but he'll get criticism from the right\nIt's much easier thing for him to do for the rest of his life when he's going to want to be at the country club or he's going to be able to go and get a contributor ship at MSNBC or CNN or ABC and he'll say I'm the Republican who broke ranks in order to try and defend\nOr what does the process of getting an FBI investigation was total and complete garbage that's when in doubt tappers got an entirely wrong that's

as\nYou're being told that is of course told that his by people like me in a a bunch of others but not the mainstream media not the overwhelming\nNumber of media outlets out there they're so invested in telling you that Trump is a bumbling the food that he can't do anything right that he's terrible in negotiation that he has no idea what he's doing this is what they'll tell you\nI'm this doesn't swear at the reality though and you know I'm I'm Out here in this this conference a which stands for research some of you\nKnow them 'cause I Do a podcast with their with their founder and chairman and stands for it's a it's a great group\nI learned a lot about investing in finance from them I really enjoy working with them but they bring out all these experts experts on trade and crypto

know that's one thing you get a lot of these people go on TV are all going to cost them a style of across like a number as oh this is what Paul Krugman says\nI'm Talking about people that have to be right because of where they're putting their money where they're investing what they're doing and even the ones that were very skeptical at Trump and there's a lot of Trump skeptics out here that I'm Talking to you\nYou will just capital Trump or saying you can't disregard the results and that's what people want to do I'm not even saying you know you're not allowed to argue that the results aren't as good as people say fine you know people want to quibble over how good the results have been that's one thing\nBut you can't just regard them you can't say oh the economy is amazing but it's not Trump that did this or Trump doesn't get any credit for this that just\nThat's being unreasonable that's not looking at the evidence and making\nDecisions based on what's well making coming to conclusions based on what's really happening here\nOr there and there's some other stuff that has been said about Trump in the last day or so you had to a union leader a union leader no less thanking Trump for tax breaks play Thirteen\nThanks to Mr ... tax rate farms and they are in\nGeneral confidence in the economy I guess we have really been able to invest more in our employees and grow our company and the last year were investing more in\nIn play wages and\n... and ... says are spending millions on Clinton and I said and\nIn general is the thing is huge increase in and work this coming out because the attorneys are spending more to update\nThe aging infrastructure so thank you very and I made a huge impact\nLooking to grow about ah twenty or thirty percent more and places and the next few months we had a lot of large projects that are starting and um [noise] let's we'll make I think a big difference and\nReally it is and ... that are good for businesses are really important for our employees also the communities we work at it and leave\nAnd thankful and had the ... President Trump for an office\nSo that's a union leader telling you what the tax break has meant for the union that she represents for the employees that people showing up trying to earn a living trying to pay their mortgage feed their families and all this positive stuff she's saying you're you're getting the message elsewhere\nIt's not rocket science folks if you have more money if your business has to give less of the money that it makes if you have to have less of your property taken from you by the government venue or in a better position\nTo invest to pay people more to grow to compete this is\nIt's so straightforward isn't Democrats come up with all these ... theories about oh no we need a higher tax for why should we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world why does that make sense someone explain that to me because we get the best government services for our business is that is a laugh\nAnd it's not even just the tax breaks that have resulted in so many benefits and and so much good stuff going on or there's also the regulatory environment change which I I ...

chance of defeating Donald Trump just doesn't have it doesn't have the skills\nAnd I think that she's also already really been marginalized by building a career\nBased on racial fraud that's what you did\nOr that she became a senator because she was a Harvard law professor she became a Harvard law professor because she claimed that she was a Native American on an application there now I Would say that I'm actually\nIn favor of doing that meaning I'm In favor of using the system in that way but only to bring the system crumbling down and to be open and honest about it and say oh no I Know are not Native American but I claimed it\nI think I'm a I think I'm about\nPercent according to my brother's ancestry DNA I think I'm two percent so good I claim Native American status I'm I'm not exactly sure I don't I don't know what it's worth a shot\nBut I don't think war and speaking of a shot I don't think Warren's got a shot and the fact that she's even talking about this for twenty twenty just goes to show you wow Democrats have a very weak bench right now\nAlso this notion that she needs to turn the country around I I keep returning to this\nNo ... this point because I I have to tell you I'm I'm sitting here and I keep saying to myself\nWhat exactly is it the Democrats hate so much about what's happening around us well what is really their objection again we're not starting wars in countries we don't need to be at war in we don't have some ... we we don't have the worst thing happened in this country now so crazy Democrats are it's just the truth\nThere's nothing that's going on right now that you say to yourself oh my gosh this doesn't stop I don't know what's gonna happen I don't know what kind of shape are going to be a no that's\nThat's not reality reality is that overall

properly ...\nHow a person like having all would feel under the circumstances\nI think that you're taking a lot of your outside observations about as you say preppy spoiled kids and and try and

there's far too much sexual misconduct among them none of that actually matters\nWhen you're looking at the innocent or guilty of an individual did Kavanaugh do this thing is there evidence to believe he did this thing I answer those questions no and no\nAnd I also think that your your being far too kind to Dr Ford's very selective memory and her recall is such that she cannot be challenged on anything and\nShe's only certain\nThat Kavanaugh's the bad guy I find that a little too convenient I don't believe it I don't believe that her memory is accurate\nMaybe she believes that this happened to her but I Do not think that her recollection of events squares with reality that said Sally I Do like when people write in who disagree I Do like when people want to try to either convince me of their side or just have a different voice heard so\nDon't feel like I'm In any way trying to shut you down or shout you down I I just have to tell you why I strongly disagree with your entire\nPremise on all of this um or I should say I disagree with your analysis on all of this max\nRight hey buck a with a new FBI investigation look into the will the new FBI investigation look into the new accusers background where we learn is lousy for ever had a substance abuse problem or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or borderline personality\nWill we learn what she was like in high school and college or if she ever complain of any other instance of sexual assault or having been molested aren't these things that we should note to assess the reliability of her memories from thirty six years ago\nMax let me tell you uh I I agree in the sense that your question here is why is it that we don't get any answers about lousy for why is it that lousy Ford\nIs a sacrosanct she cannot be cross examined she cannot be challenged her sexual history when she was ah in high school her sexual history in college or as an adult beyond that\nOf that can be discussed ... meanwhile Kavanaugh can be\nTrashed why is that because he's accused\nI'm Sorry but we have a system of justice that relies upon oppositional narratives\nAnd it's not just you get the first crack at somebody and then they don't get to come back and tell their side of the story or this is fundamental to our justice system we are letting it'd be abused in front of us right now because there are so many people\nThat just want to believe lousy for desperately want to believe it for reasons of politics for reasons of their own emotional attachment to the notion of sexual abuse is something that has not taken\nSeriously I reject that by the way I think the sexual abuse has taken very seriously there's a reason that sexual abuse in many different ... you know many different iterations is a very\nSerious felonies people go to prison for a long time so I I reject this narrative of sexual abuse is not taken seriously which a lot of people seem to want to believe\nUh Jennifer I say there podcast listener here

are similar to her description under oath long did I miss something and this new cycle it's possible know Jennifer I don't think he missed anything I think the two questions test\nSeems suspect me all along and I think that the whole polygraph in the way that they have been trying to hold this up as the biggest piece of objective evidence they have I think that it's\nA I I think it's a scam quite honestly I think the polygraphs aren't used in court for good reason and I think that we should all be very clear that what's going on here is all coordinated if you didn't want if she didn't want to

I I highly recommend it\nWell thirty nine was gone with the wind right and the wizard of Oz\nSo you had some really big movies it's easy for a movie they get lost so now I have to look this up shot over doubt I Will check this out Jody I Will absolutely\nTake a look at that and a night of the living dead is the one you want to see if you want to be scared dawn of the dead was the sequel and I think it was a lot cheesier it's still is wonderful in terms of horror film classics\nBut to me there's nothing nothing scarier than nine to the living dead in a close second is Texas Chainsaw massacre too because I I knew the young lady who played the lead in that\nAnd that movie would just terrifying so I'm so glad you're still out there Jody so glad you're still loyal to buck and uh all of all of his exploits and appreciate you being there every time I'm here filling in for thank you very much my friend\nOr a ... a lot going on I Want to bring something up I was talking about\nAh just before the break I was talking about one of the sponsors of this program ...\nAnd it's a company that has a new social media platform and I think it's really important especially when we see what's going on on social media it's been weeks now that one of the brighter people on social media who happens to be a conservative has been silent some talking about James Woods\nJames Woods has over a million followers and Twitter has told him he cannot come back on line unless he removes something he posted he posted a comedic meet him\nAnd he even said this basically is a joke but they told him unless he deletes it he's not allowed back on the format and I thought wow this is a publicly traded company and and then I thought well maybe just maybe they're out there making sure that\nThey apply the same kinds of standards of principles to everybody who's on Twitter and I looked at and I saw\nThe horrific thing the Rosie o'donald posted\nAfter Lindsey Graham went after the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and called them out for what they were doing how they were destroying judge Kavanaugh and how they were actually make it impossible for anyone to want to be\nWell a Supreme Court justice God Knows what else will be affected by this attack on a good man but Rosie o'donald tweeted out\nAnd I have to um have to delete\nOf the things she said 'cause they can't say I'm On the radio she said F. you you closeted idiot this is the patriarchy exposed this is reality deal with it no Kavanaugh's confirmation not my president well Rosie O'Donnell\nPut that out there and went after Lindsey Graham and she's basically here's a gay woman who's making an allegation that Lindsey Graham is a closeted homosexual\nHow is that allowed how is that not considered hate speech how does that not considered to be over the line by the gods of Twitter\nHow Twitter how explain I guess if you're a liberal you can say just about anything\nI guess if you're a person on the other side of the aisle it's okay to smear somebody for example a Bill Maher did the same thing Bill Maher on his show this past weekend after Lindsey Graham gave his fiery speech supporting judge Kavanaugh\nThis was on television this weekend and appeared all over Twitter\nYou know which is bad is this truck before I\nThat Trump can either find people like him or make ... strain was stabilizing influence your boyfriend because he is [noise]\nChanel bill Marr has smeared Lindsey Graham and he is also smeared John McCain all in in Seventeen Seconds on his show\nHow is this a loud and don't even get me started on what senator now why did attacking Kavanaugh\nSaturday Night live attacking Kavanaugh and Graham and the entire process is all about any means necessary to tear down this nominee\nBut I don't understand how one social media platform is allowed to\nSingle handedly silence conservative it's I've been shadow band if I put a post on my Twitter account at stumped for and if you will and I include a reference to a gun or a firearm\nIs uniformly relegated to the ash sheet of Twitter shadow banning I'm shoved off into the abyss and not given the opportunity to let my audience read it\nBut if I take out the word gun or a firearm\nAnd put in something like banana\nInstantly it's available to everybody\nI Know it sounds paranoid but it it's true so how's this allowed how's this even allowed to happen\nWell I think we've lost their minds\nWe have given every opportunity to be offensive to the left and zero to be offensive from the right and maybe it's time we all stood up and looked at some of our folks and there are alternatives to these other social media platforms I'm just saying oh I don't\nGet me started on Cathy Griffin Kathy Griffin also went after Lindsey Graham and called Lindsey Graham ms Lindsey Graham\nAnd John Lennon overt CNN additionally said that Lindsey Graham had the vapors something usually attributed to a woman in the south\nSo Don Lemon Kathy Griffin Rosie O'Donnell and Bill Maher you can all make jokes that impugn a man's heterosexuality or mark a man\nAnd yet you are the people living in the universe\nIt seems like the people in the universe might get a little upset too but I guess not I guess this is about any means necessary and I just don't understand\nIt I maybe I'll get a quick uh movie here a time in New Haven Connecticut Welcome to the buck sex than show yet a scary movie for me\nYes I did a a Halloween you know as much in the lame\nYou know that's a really good point to the babies too obvious that they were talking about October and the fact that so many scary movies come out but Halloween now which one I thought like forty million of them\nCome along that God are you know I'm just going to say just like the gentleman on the part wanting park to hand down and no one mentioned friday the thirteenth\n... you know you're right on Robert England would be mad about that if we didn't [laughter]\nNo no no no that that's a nightmare on elm street that was my choice but Halloween\nSorry I'm Sorry I got people yelling in my you know no no that's not married out straight yeah\nI don't and you know what I recognize the shining and uh the empty all horror absolutely The Exorcist hands down five stars five stars but\nAll I was born in Seventy one so I don't really recall too many of them about the nightmare on elm should try not to allow a wage yeah it's way too many Halloween but we try to search age but those definitely\nWell as some of them work she got to keep doing it that's that's the way we are Tom I appreciate you for joining the conversation real quickly Dave in Albany New York you got a scary movie for me Dave\n[noise] ah the shining\nYeah it looks like the shining is running away with it tonight I thought it was going to be able to convince people that neither living dead is the one that deserves it but ah the ... Senate votes\nRight now leaning towards the shining\nOr false are classics and therefore I think for me there\nWell there's a lot of good ones out there I I've been in my\nMind has been open up to a lot and there's a lot that don't have monsters they just have terrifying story line it's it's crazy but thank you for calling and Dave I appreciate you that's a good suggestion again the shining\nThe incident happened in Connecticut well Kevin I was attending Yale he was accused of throwing ice on a man while one of Kavanaugh's friends supposedly through a glass at the guy no arrests were made President Trump says Democrats are the party of crime\nThere really are you look at what they're doing even look at what they're doing in Congress even look at what they're doing with our laws the way they treat our laws the way they speak our our country\nAt a rally in Tennessee tonight the president pointed to democratic policies on immigration saying they favor open borders the Justice Department is working to ban bump stocks which are rifled accessories that make guns function as if they're automatic\nOn the one year anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in us history the D.

I came out of the belly I was like a year that was a jumping\nThe the thing but you're right about the wizard of Oz or we were in a big family and we would watch it on TV one would come on every

didn't follow up they were up there already and it's I don't know where I was a kid at the high school cars whatever you're always downstairs you know cardio stuff why would they be waiting upstairs

waiting to violence\nThreats I got the same so how do you marry the situation with the president last week says he's a national audience daily say white nationalist to that he does have to take some responsibility for the type of rain than vital climate that we find ourselves answer\nPresence opposite racist things obviously demagogue condos and if I'm ... stokes of national it said this is all the left\nReally has by the way at the national level for why you should vote for Democrats Trump is so terrible Trump is such an awful person and what they don't seem to understand is how much that then factors in to the other side beating our sides unwillingness to change any of our tactics\nDo not try to convince us they are trying to strong arm us into abandoning trumpeter bending the movement they're not making good arguments they're engaging in moral blackmail\nWhy would anybody who's really thinking about the issues and thinking about what affects them and their day to day lives\nWhy would they listen to any of this they're not even saying hey let's have a bigger European style social welfare state with free college and free healthcare now and as you know there's no such thing as free so it's really\nA ... you know state\nPaid for health care and state paid for college which means you pay for the question of how much it who\nAnd then let the mayhem of the bureaucracy ah get unleashed in terms of price and and the distribution of care and everything else but you're not even hearing them make a real picture about any of this\n... this is where we are the Democrats I think had been anticipating either a bad economy right a ... a downturn economy right before the election war they were anticipating that people would become\nShow beaten down by the anti Trump rhetoric and all this stuff about racism and racist Republicans on the show terrible on a show of all that stuff they really thought\nThat that would be enough to turn the tables against Trump but they don't understand is by doing that\nThey're actually making the case 'cause there's only some people were going to be persuaded right you're you're never going to you're not going to turn the tables with some ... hat\nWearing Trump early stage true believer many of whom listen to the show and high five to all of you for seeing a political movement that Ninety five percent of the professional political class\nHad no idea what's happening until basically had added already occurred on election day\nRight so you guys thought Ninety five percent of the professional political elites did not but you're obviously not going to change your mind based on\nWhat they said no matter what no matter what right I mean 'cause you see the result but I'm Talking about if this is really a function of the persuadable going into this midterm election a few days right we're we're a week away\nFrom finding out who controls the Senate who controls the house that has profound implications for certainly the next two years I'm not I'm not the most important election of our lifetime that it's not true okay that'd be ... stop what that\nIs twenty twenty gonna be the most important election would probably be the second most important election of my lifetime because I think the most important was twenty six feet\nSo twenty twenty will probably be the second most important I don't think you're ever going to outdo twenty sixteen but you know obviously every election really matters and and the next two years or that the tone will be set\nIn terms of legislation and what the government's going to do by how this mid term shakes out and that's why I just think it's so noticeable the Democrats aren't even\nAt the at the national level and they're trying to do this thing and every different race will do they're trying to run a good candidate for the district right or a good candidate in that state if it's kind of a purple state so they have these people that are a little centrist on some issues it's like the Joe Manchin affect\nHow is Joe Manchin even a Democrat 'cause he likes unions\nI you know you look at it because he's pro worker I mean Trump is pro worker so you know you get some of these people who are Democrats who might as well be Republicans there's a few of those but much more common was on the left or people that are pretending to be\nA more centrist then they will vote to sexually fool the voters and then get in bed with the Democrats later I mean that that the more common tactic that's much more likely to be a what you see happening and and that's why it's either a local local media markets stuff about\nHow protecting protecting preexisting conditions on Obamacare and that's what this is all about but at the national level all you're hearing you get base turnout from a left his trumpet Trump is a racist these terrible\nAnd you know they're just they're never going to stop so\nThat's why whenever they make it sound like oh if only Trump would if only trouble one what stopped being Trump's and you'll like him this is nonsense waste are based on a mentioned twenty twenty and how do the second most important election of of my

J.\nSprings Colorado is news dependable accurate ballots [noise]\nFive Ninety Casey as Jerry yesterday on\nMy heart radio or do your Google was just an okay Google like five Ninety KCBS Jay on I heart radio all your favorite music all your favorite stations like us all three of my heart radio try at you like it on your smart speaker new stock by Ninety KCBS Jay and I heard media\nSarah are you this is a this is a part of the discussion that I think always somehow gets or other pushed aside because the politics or maybe there's just some some on his confusion on the part of those who are trying to get a handle on this epidemic but we always hear that it's the proceeds prescription drugs that are pushing this epidemic for what you're\nTelling me ... it's it's really that these are similar to prescription drugs but there are being obtained illegally and being made illegally so ...\nIs is that an accurate reader of what's going on here it is it is being made invests in Mexico it's obviously they're not being filtered through Pfizer and then sold via legitimate pharmacies to people in the streets this is just cutting out Pfizer has ... from the picture and or any drug company entirely from his\nParents who are we so we know that there was a problem and we know that there was a problem with the pharmaceutical companies and that's been very public and that you know the dangers of you know over prescribing a opioids to patients even when you're going in for a debt tool\nFor dental work there was over prescription of opioids on we saw a rise in that not only with veterans but with both with people across the board in the United states when when the escalation of addiction\nRates started sky rocketing\nBut what what happened was as soon as those\nIssues began to be regulated and of course the federal government stepped in doctors stopped over prescribing for the most part one of the things that happened was the drug cartels said wow look at this we can potentially be making billions off of this and that's exactly what they're doing and not just the drug cartels\nBut China China is also a cooperative this with that and all and I think we've been hearing a lot about that at least a little bit more in the news media\nAnd what they've done is they have created their own till they're owned pharmacies and and they made him look like the actual pills so some of the markings I was actually in Ohio talking to some of the undercover da\n... that are working there and some of the local law enforcement who work with the DEA ... look these pills are almost identical you look at it as an ex it looks like a Xanax that would be made by a a a pharmaceutical company but\nIt's not it's not a real ... it's not a real purpose that it's not a real actually caught either way taking those for recreational use is dangerous it's addictive it ends to lives lost\nBut when you see it come talented with enormous amount of narcotics that are being spilled into our streets this poison\nAnd I'd sure about you you hear about this all the time but sat in all it's so dangerous that in its pure form\nWhich has moved across the United states many times in its pure form could literally cause someone to overdose and die by just touching it and in the documentary it's explained very well that only for grant for little grains like four little grains of table salt\nOf that no could literally kill a grown man\nAnd we've seen loads of this stuff come into the United states for example in April this year in Nebraska state troopers they seized over a hundred and Eighteen pounds of that and all\nAnd authority said this is enough to kill twenty six million people when we showcased\nAre ... and premier the movie here in Washington DC and then showcase did in Ohio which was which is really the epicenter we use Ohio as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country when we showcased it they're one of the head of the DEA Mario Jimenez\nCame and talked to the audience you know the full house because Ohio is really struggling with addiction rate and he said look if I close off this theater right now and they released a small package affecting all through the air system\nWe would all be dead\nHe said so this is no longer just about addiction this is about saving our children's lives\nRealizing that this is a potential national security threat really understanding where this is coming from and not being ashamed not being ashamed about addiction we have to come out you have to talk to our kids\nWe have to let them know what's out on the streets we have to be open and honest with one another if we're ever going to find a solution and I'm not saying we're going to find a solution to stopping addiction we have to stop this before something potentially so dangerous happen\nBefore we lose a generation of our kids and we have to face it and we have to be honest about it [noise]\nService this documentary tacos what is the biggest health crisis in the United states are more people are dying\nFrom this than died from the height of the AIDS epidemic or the crack epidemic in this country ah when when you speak to these families obviously\nGoing to be very and people that have been affected by this in any respect because it's very emotional and and it's it's haunting for people there's clearly no a greater awareness of it than ever before what what is the answer what can we do about this\nI think first of all people have to find their lane everybody in ... in\nAn all parts of the ... our communities need to find out what they can do what's their role as a parent it's educating your child\nAs a health care provider it's understanding what's going on and be able to be aware of of the potential dangers out there and assessing goes right away so we can save lives and as people we have to realize we have a problem with addiction we also have to have the right\nResources appropriate at the right way so that when the federal government put money\nAside for this epidemic\nThat there's accountability for it that this money isn't being funneled through the federal system through state and local agencies and and just disappearing into the vast array of our of our\nOf our money pet but that it's actually working\nAnd that we support our law enforcement and our federal law enforcement I Believe that as this as we start looking at this on a broader scale especially with the threat of setting all especially with the threat of the drug cartels and how they're pouring this poison into our system and into our children's lives we call it not in vain V. E. I. N.\nNo I didn't gain the drug cartels are using the veins of our highways to infiltrate and lose their contraband into the United states and that and you are people's gains and into our children's game and we have to find a way to stop this we have to work with our southern partners with Mexico\nWith Colombia with Guatemala with Nicaragua with El Salvador we have to insist that they do their part and honestly there were a few people in the documentary that brought up some great ideas you know look this is not just a criminal organization this has now become a transnational terrorist\nOrganization they are pumping and chemicals that could potentially endanger the lives of millions of people and we have to start treating it that way whether that's putting up the wall building the wall or enforcing laws\nOn international live and going after some of these drug dealers that's what we have to do more importantly educating ourselves and educating our children I Can't tell you but how many parents I Know\nThat have no idea that this is actually going on on the streets they have no idea that these pills are manufactured in trailers that that our kids are purchasing step that the drug cartels are making look like pharmaceutical or prescriptions\nA that what our children are doing really understand that it starts at home that it starts at home and now we've got to tackle the bigger broader problem of holding people accountable\nLike the drug cartels in Mexico like you know lower elementary 'til all these different cartel the Beltran Leyva at really making sure that the Mexican government understand that we're no longer playing games\nThat the the left has whenever they're running for office or their somebody in public life you know their public persona\nIs wind is something get treated as a joke versus when is it treated\nSeriously and and when it's done when given the benefit of the doubt\nBy the media you know the narrative the conversation that people have based on what they're reading what they're being told what they're hearing when's that benefit the doubt given to somebody versus when are they to be made an example of which is the obviously the opposite of the opposite effect of all that\nAnd the truth is it's a\nIt's still very much the case that lives pretty much across the board get the benefit of the doubt and then some and conservatives just get crushed and I find that frustrating and\nThis this reminds me of a Lindsey Graham is saying well the only way to get lifted\nChange is to\nDrive them from their villages and here the limitations of their women so to speak ah here's what he here's what Lindsey says about this liquid to\nThe American people have had it with this I've had with it\nKavanaugh the caravan blaming Trump for everything under the sides if you want to change the way the country is going and you want to tell these people they got it wrong\nThen vote a week from tomorrow for the Republican Party the only way they're gonna changes for them to lose the ... the main anything and if you don't want any more Kavanaugh carrier assassinations are\nThen you need to reject what they did and hand them that the state they deserve they want power so badly the media is and the tank for them and the only way they'll get it as for the American thankful to send a loud and clear signal that we're tired of you tired of their tax they've had outlining every Republican for everything\nI think this is an essential element of the Trump movement\nIt really is it really is a strategy winning and winning and winning really is a political strategy and I noticed that sounds ridiculous because it has not always the strategy no in fact Republicans for a long time we're happy to lose as long as they last like gentleman\nBut that obviously didn't get the left to act more gentle mentally it just got the left who say oh great we're winning\nScrew the other guys Trump comes in and says okay it's not going to be perfect is not going to be pretty but if we want them to change we've gotta when\nLindsey Graham is saying that you and you know what Lindsey Graham two point oh is correct

usually don't miss an opportunity to spin that narrative well Maria they are already out\nSpinning a narrative perhaps not quite as clearly as they have or as a and full throated a fashion that they have in the past I think that's mostly because\nThe anti gun anti Second Amendment left knows enough to know that right now there are Democrats who are in some tight races in states where a gun rights are very much a supported by folks who vote\nAnd so they don't want to create more problems the Democratic party right now that's the only reason I think your honestly not seeing more shrill ah anti

much worse stuff in the oval office you know Bill Clinton's\nDisgrace\nOr it's something that the left was not just they didn't just turn a blind eye to eye they aggressively aggressively and with all they could muster with all the help they could get in the media and you know people like Stephanopoulos Stephanopoulos was part of the Clinton machinery for example\nAnd he is treated with with ... and he's a hundred million dollar men now ABC\nNews anchor that has to be ... who decides to pay that much money it's it's just an astonishing thing it really is oh without Stephanopoulos who would watch these shows everybody would watch these shows these are platforms wherever they put in these roles is going to get a certain amount of viewership\nBut he seems to get a excused from being a part of a country machinery and Hillary who just had her clearance taken away I mean Hillary just\nWas finally told you don't get to have a security clearance anymore for jury on flagrant violations of national security protocol for anybody who has a clearance she was just told that now she still hasn't\nRaised show has been achieved even a modicum of honesty you could say to bar from Obama\nSmoking smoking um honesty she doesn't have a smidgen of honesty she's such a liar and she knows that she well she still thinks that she has a a political future and it would be a problem\nFor her the left has gone show all in on this whole\nMe too movement they've made this such a a prominent part of what the left and for now it's the ... movement of the moment I we've had black lives matter or we've had Occupy Wall street we've had these different a political ... revolutionary\nLeftist movements in this country and right now it's the me too movement it will change they will move to some other intellectual fat or fashion in\nSome time just just wait for it but in the meantime they have to make sure that they don't have the weaponization of some of these things occurring back on them\nThey don't want to score and their own goals here with the me too movement and that the enabler I've always felt that the enablers in this whole process we're getting off far too easy you know the people men and women around someone like a Harvey Weinstein seeing people men and women around someone like\nA Les Moonves you know those who were\nNecessary in this whole process of predation they they don't get in trouble they don't really get called out and Hillary was the ultimate in that not only did\nShe stand by her man of course as we know for the most obvious and a self interested political reasons imaginable bushy went on the attack against these women and whenever I hear people say things like don't they have a right to be believed\nI was wondering respond well to the women that Hillary demeaned I mean did did the women that were completely attack verbally in the media down to their very character\nThey were all considered to be fighters for the cause at\nThe time and there has been no accountability for that whatsoever and there's no accountability to stay for Hillary when when she held accountable for the fact that she was\nEssential in her husband's not just denials but continued book flagrant violations of the public trust and an overhaul Bill Clinton was accused of rape folks rape not just your ... and I really don't like and this happens you know this usage of the term\nSexual assault and sexual harassment being conflated with sexual assault and all of a sudden people are like well you know both sides have their problems you've got Clarence Thomas on one side Bill Clinton\nOn the other no Clarence Thomas was accused and I don't think particularly credibly accused of saying some inappropriate stuff in the office I mean a worst case basis Clarence Thomas should have been pulled aside by age aren't told hey you know knock that off there's going to be professional consequences that if he did it I think he did it\nBill Clinton could have spent decades in prison for what he did the allegations against Bill Clinton were of of rape by force and that's\nThat's going to send you to prison for very long time in your life is essentially over and he went on to be the president of the states for eight years so yes Hillary coming out now and saying that she wasn't a part of any this\nShe lies now with such fluidity and so shamelessly I Would

is back [noise]\nMaybe I'm particularly attuned to this right now because of the madness that we have seen just just today a with regard to this Elizabeth Warren DNA\nFiasco this this self inflicted wound that uh that Elizabeth Warren now has ... and and it reminds me though that that's the last\nReally is increasingly a just just\nLosing his mind I mean there's nothing that you can really say any more of that is an extension of their previous\nBeliefs there's there's nothing that you can really say and think well there's no way they'd ever make that you know ... ... if I'm trying to make a point about the extremes of what they believe and what they think they wouldn't go that far\nWell it it turns out that we're running out of\nAreas where that is still true it it turns out that there are very few things that we can point to and say oh they would never they would never allow that thing to happen anymore because those examples that we used to use are increasingly now the reality on the left\nRight so this is that this is the perfect example you have the Daily Caller with a piece that a biological male\nWho identifies as a transgender woman\nWon a woman's world championships cycling event on Sunday you know Rachel McKinnon a professor the College of Charleston won the women's sprint thirty five to thirty nine of age bracket at the twenty Eighteen UCI master's tracks cycling world championship in Los Angeles\nSo we have somebody who's the first transgender woman world champion ever and we're supposed to celebrate this do they really expect us to celebrate\nThis is supposed to be treated like it is in some way a victory a victory for whom I advocate for transgender rights\nCertainly not a victory for women the reason that we have sex segregated sports is not because of sexism and maybe this is where progressive Z\nJust can't follow the logic training or maybe they just are unable to understand this but the reason we have sex segregated sports\nIs because men are overwhelmingly and invariably biologically larger heavier stronger and faster than women as a function of hormones and genetics\nThat's just that's the truth I mean I\nI used to occasionally with some friends of mine a scrimmage with some of the women's varsity teams when I was in in college and then I can tell you that I a reasonably athletic\nCollege male would probably be a three sport superstar for most female programs if he had had some of the of the same skills by playing let's say on a high school team I mean that's just the truth\nBut that's why we have sex segregated sports but the leftist show devoted to this idea of transgender rights in transgender resume as something that must be celebrated remember I've told you the the way that the progressive approach these issues is it starts with just just tolerant be tolerant\nAnd then it's you know be inclusive and then it's celebrated and then it's you know\nExcept willing to accept this or else which is basically a version celebrated but they they always have this sliding scale and it will start just with oh just tolerate it that's the first thing\nAnd and then you have to you know later you off from it and then you'll be told to celebrate it that's I skipped affirmed to celebrate their before but here we have it I mean if I told you five years ago\nThat we would see pieces about how men could compete in female sporting events because they say they're transgender and that would be considered fair somehow on the left\nYou'd say buck that's just crazy and I would say well yes it's crazy but now it's true now it's happening\nA this that's why these here you have this is the ... this was the women's world championships women's world championships and uh you have your men competing in these events now\nThan the whole notion that we have to say biological mail I Would note is a misnomer because male is a function of biology as his female we can pretend to these things are separate we can pretend that they are distinct but we're just only fooling ourselves and\nAnd it can't be a shock to anybody that are on a day or it shouldn't come into shock that on the same day we were told that somebody can claim to be Native American because they are point point point zero zero zero zero zero one seven whatever Native American and not even really Native American\nI I think that there's ... there's an adaptation going on in my thinking and it's maybe something I've been a little slower than some of my other colleagues on the right to adopt in some ways because I come from this perspective of\nWell this'll sound self aggrandizing but knowledge having a background in in the actual work that I Do especially in the national security side knowledge and facts and wisdom that's how I tried to approach would I Do and and so I always want to think that I could have\nLiberals listen to this show when I certainly hope to all the liberals who are listening that they still feel this way but I Want them know that I I Want to bring them over to my side\nA and I don't want to be too strident that has always been my approach but recently the left has gone insane and so I Am separating out in my mind\nI Want to say in saying I mean more insane than usual I separated in my mind how I speak to Democrats really in general from how I'm now speaking to the hardcore left because I Am an ideological war with the hardcore less a centrist Democrats\nI Want to come over to my side not necessarily even on everything but um whatever they're willing to\nBut the hardcore left just must be ideologically smashed and and destroyed it must be defeated you know the ... the ah the people that are running around with the pink hats on and that are saying due process doesn't count anymore and\nThey they the ones who are doing deep platform and want people to be boycotted and to be fired from their jobs for\nExpressing conservative opinions we we have to fight that ideology not not meet it in a gentleman the contest but we actually have to throw some elbows\nAnd that that maybe has been a a learning process for me in this Arab Trump because I've seen more and more of what the left are not just with the left is but how much of the Democrat Party and how much of the ideological a center left they control\nAnd the hard left I mean the progressive vanguard each way to prominent way too powerful and can and cannot be a just wished away any more so if I found that all like I'm a little more strident or a little more uh fired up about things in the last few months it's really because\nI've seen what this battle we're entering into is all about\nAnd this is political total war this is not a you know made the best man when this is one man will win and one man will not leave the octagon so to speak and in that kind of political environment you ... you have to be ready to to go bare knuckle an end in a sense that's really what I've learned from Trump you know there there have been some things\nThat Trump has Donald Trump is said and I thought oh my gosh that's such a mistake oh my gosh how could Trump if have gone with that that's so that's so foolish of and that's so silly and then within a few and this happens less and less now because I realize we're dealing with with Trump\nOr and then time passes and I realized wait a second he was right\nTo apologize for that they would have just mould him like a like a ... I was gonna say a flock of ... but now I'm mixing things up a like a school of angry raging per on us or that they they would have torn apart if he had\nAgreed to what they said he should agreed to about one statement you made or another better just stand and fight and constantly push back on these issues these things that I'm learning from Trump isn't just like all of you\nI have to adapt my approach and my thinking for the the current moment I have to actually think about what's working what's not working and I I reevaluate I'll say one of the most important lessons I've seen one of the biggest\nUh differentiate or is when it comes to whether someone is successful or not is do they have the capacity for self correction\nOr do they have the ability to look at whatever they're doing in life how they're treating themselves how they're treating other people or how they are doing their work or whatever how how they're taking care of their health and an objectively assess what is going right what is not what is going wrong are not going well\nAnd make changes I'm constantly making changes I mean I have core principles and a and an approach and an east coast but I'm counting making changes to what I think is going to to work best in this this ideological fight I mean that's really what I Do hear everyday yes I like to present information and there's an aspect\nOf this that's a really just about there I say ... community right we're all a community here on the show um but there's also how can I equip\nThose listen to the show with the best arguments possible and equip them also with the knowledge that they are in fact correct in their beliefs I ... explain not just what we should all thinking about different issues but why we should think that way\nSo I think that's all very very important um and and yeah I I Am also in a process of of learning all the time I don't want to ever make it seem like I'm just the one guy who thinks that he's doing it the right way and and it's never adjusting I'm adjusting all the time\nBrad writes dear book I just read that Hillary Clinton security clearance revoked at her request\nI was wondering what are your thoughts on this are and why in the world would she make such a request especially if she's planning on running again in twenty twenty\nI'm a loyal pod cast listener and wanted to thank you for releasing your podcast earlier so us folks up here in Alaska and listen to it on the way home ... thanks for keeping us in the know Brad a well Brett first of all I'm so glad you liked the pocket gases out sooner and I'm hoping that everybody in the west coast now is that we're pretty much now our\nPodcast is going up for this show for the buck sex and show in drive time on the west coast\nSo you know ... there's no problem with you decide and that you're going to just get a little bit ahead of the game and a and listening to a lower early ... you don't have to wait you have to wait for it to be rebroadcast her to be broadcast on whatever stations near you you can listen to it on the\nOn the podcast however you consume podcast or and so that's great news and you're listening up in Alaska that way and as for keeping everybody in the no I certainly try Hillary and her security clearance\nLook let's just let's just call it where it is Hillary should never have been able to keep a security clearance after the debacle that occurred with her private email server private email account all that stuff and that was just\nCompletely it should've been terrifically embarrassing or for anybody not just associated with Hillary Clinton but who was willing to defend that nonsense that she held to a new clearance until this point just goes to show you how broken the system is\nWhat am I knew all that just this Friday I Will be doing an event with my friends that stands for research\nThere'll be about what's coming next in the markets and big big things to tell you about I'll be joining them for a full [noise]\nLive event this Friday just go to buck event dot com free to register folks totally free you can watch the whole thing register for free all free book events dot com and getting ...

industrial deep state which is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations and I don't know how you defined I Divide that this worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that uh I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together agreeing with the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order that wants to take over go to Jackie in California Hi Jack you're on ground zero\n[noise] ... yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things to just didn't ring true to me about how you feel name could so he\nCould show games like Amazon gift show gets ...\n... you know you had the church came out ...\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise] well if they knew that these guys were there to put it on somebody why didn't they stop them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit but they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is\nHave you ever heard of a of any nation state funding Fifteen people to do it\nI mean if you're if you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill people you have in a in a place like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true\nBut Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now because you're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but you know\nFeet does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket\nWould have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of a worldwide deep state manipulation it is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump is about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWith this ... this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go by\nWell\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy wish it were to look at\nAn other indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil's going to start going up I think to moral can be a very bad day in the stock market is is this thing somehow\nStarts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when cars show ...\nIs a Saudi citizens\nAnd he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states as a consequence the president United States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia\nBut you know watch him get pressure to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to lead the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed in was dismembered and they flew his remains I Can't remember the food too but uh the gloom out of the country\nFlight if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the hit team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it will\nProbably do the same reason uh you said that he was in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can't get in there and embassy and do anything about it\nWell but but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey may be arguments the CIA was facilitating operation deep said opportune argument that he'd said operatives in the eye a\nPoor facilitators to the murder of this uh uh I'm a ... and of course Saudi Arabian\nUs to be said operators were involved here as well now if turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too but what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more because of Trump's pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that can happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you would want an incident is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia and\nThe thing that I have a feeling we do need to do that while I have a feeling though that's\nWhat they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you've got Bolton who certainly was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and if they moved them into another George W. Bush were screwed so he's a am old\nEnough to remember when Saudi Arabia pulled back their oil supply in the seventies and we had an immediate gasoline shortage there were long lines for gasoline yet and they went to the odd even license plates right so you can gas up one day if you play it was even in the next day if you play it was an even\nOn that I think they went by the last number of your plate so I remember I was working in the motion picture business at the time and I'd have to have my\nWe had two cars so I'd have my wife gets up the car for me you know to get the car ready for the next day and then that day she gets up the other car\nAnd because the lions horrible I didn't have time to wait in line for gas but the price of gas skyrocketed and you can only imagine the leverage that Saudi Arabia still has now they've pulled back or on their oil and they're saying if we're retaliated against by sanctions or any other means\nA that we're going to fall back on our oil and I think they use the figure that oil could go to two hundred dollars a barrel\nSo it'd be looking at ten dollars at the pump a gallon\nOr easily my critic I don't know does does a Trump want to call

eighty plus percent of our job creation is services so when you're a service economy\nThe way to stimulate your economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to state anything that raises the price of a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government as a tariff it's just another tax\nBefore we're close out here it's a real quick here to get from a great on the economy a threat what would it be so far\nWell you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents a pretty good regulations are on and taxes are down\nBut I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader\nAnd there is such a thing as subjectivity\nIn in cheerleading and you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way uh this way\nBut the economy has done better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow millions of dollars every every month you know so uh but the economy on the surface is good but it's not sound is not lasting it's based on that and the payment will come too soon\n\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul and NFL through saying it's all going to come crashing down\nBefore that you had Gary Cohn who is very much the establishment voice in and were ... years right now and he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Wal Mart and\nI was going to say here's our IDs years all righty but these are very different views\nOf what's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul um let me let me they will drop off at first I was from an interview we did on rushing by the way we're going to speak to for Congressman Paul\n[noise] ah [noise] he's right Ron Paul is right mathematically historically he is correct or there is a\nVery clear history of the currency you are in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial calamity\nIs very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly now that\nShed Ron Paul saying that the economy right now is not found a way too much debt and all that she can be right put on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't want to say oh for my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that\nIf it fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the the basic financial challenges that we all have ride telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I think that's ever going to happen but even if it weren't true that happened to fifty years that's not very useful information right now\nTo Ron Paul's been saying that the economy was going to crash out for a very long time and it was kind of writing two thousand and eight we came up on the precipice I get that are two thousand nine\nBut I don't think that he's right right now I\nPut his I put his words in there because I Do think that it's a long term warning and\nEspecially as we are considering now the possibility of dealing with some of the entitlement programs that are the big drivers of our debt we got to remember that\nWe're we're heading into we're heading to a bad place might not be two years from now might be twenty we're heading to a bad place as an economy unless we do something about it and it's very hard to get the political will you know look this is I go home and I'm like you know what I I really\nWish I'd get lean again enough that that I Would just see all my muscles right that'd be fun but you know it's more fun than than putting myself on that pretty strict routine of calories a calories in calories out and all that you know it's more fun eating a big gluten free donut when I get home\nThat's the thing they exist or you know deciding to just eat half of wheel of breed that's fun right now\nAnd when you're dealing with long term projection sneak and it was in pre amazing breeze always so good when you're dealing with long term projections in the economy does that sound will to fancy I like to debris debris delicious your is fantastic uh I also like American cheese on America Jews I'm a burger yesterday was\nDelicious [noise] ah [noise] nobody wants to be the one that has to think long term no one wants to be the one that I have to think strategically about is you want to deal with your immediate needs answer Ron Paul as I said he's right but when we just don't know [noise]\nUh that doesn't mean we shouldn't take action or just means we need to be aware that\nThe action is not going to come quickly and we should balance out what are what what what risks are acceptable what systemic risks are acceptable to our our economy for children and grandchildren's economies are and then you Gary calling with tariffs on China I I really hope that Trump is right on this one I've given up a lot of credit on the turf issue\nAnd um I've

are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars announce narrative Costa production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely not nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production cost and industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty\nMillion ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go down\nThe hall I guess not but could silver reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think's a one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate you have anything that you can send out

part of some international conspiracy Thirty years ago I Can't tell you where or when but it happened\nThat's a lot less convincing that last week I met with a guy named Bob who is part of some big

well\nTired of high taxes which we gave the tax cuts with us so much\nThat they want a strong military they want for executive they want safety they want security we give that the Democrats do not give that the Democrats don't know what they're doing they don't know what they give it I think we're going to do very very well in the race yeah\nNothing Trump's right I think that we are going to pick up Senate seat something's going to be fifty five you heard it here first fifty five Republican Senate seats by by the end of this thing not quite the super majority of sixty although wouldn't that be sweet\nMidterms going to be tight I mean a house rather intimate church going to be tight very very tight I I think it could go either way right now and it's going to be just a few seats that separate the Democrats and Republicans\nAt the end the day but Trump is incredibly\nPowerful voice in this whole debate and discussion I think that he's really making a very he's making the case very well\nWhich are the Democrats don't actually have an agenda or a platform other than trying to restore the legal and cultural edit fish of Obama is them while Trump is ...\nIsn't it and they're ... they won't be able to do that so this is really just going to be much more a rhetorical battling much more fighting it out in the media and nastiness and it really is it is moms or jobs\nAnd Republicans need to hammer that home the point that I think they're on that and they're doing they're okay and they could be stronger on this but\nOn health care I'm furious with the Republicans because they don't have a unified message and because of a couple of\nVery unreliable GOP senators we don't actually have a real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm and Obamacare is garbage in Trump is allowing people to get out of the individual\nMandate but that and also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means and what it does for them you know they are not\nEffective messengers\nOn health care and that could be I really do think if if the Democrats when that when the house it's going to be because of that issue on the

I Am ... senator don't forget it or do you want of embryo buddy I live on a city called ... you'll\nFind yesterday\nQuote yelling and elected officials in public is protected First Amendment speech and it's pretty disgusting to see journalists lecturing our fellow citizens for directly petitioning government officials\nLiked to fully brain split everything he said here as it is wrong\nIn in ... an hour ... yes it is is protected speech but that's relevant because they're protected speech we're talking about here in a restaurant no one's saying the government has a right to come in and arrest these people but the establishment could get out your trespassing is private property\nThey have that right to you know the the left thinks that the first amendment means they get to say whatever they want an act however they want and nobody else gets to say anything about it because we're infringing on their right by exercising our right they don't understand this they have no concept of a of\nRights existing in parallel to each other you know somebody can say something really stupid about Trump but I can say that was really stupid that doesn't mean that I'm getting their First Amendment right if I you know put tape over their mouth and locked him in a closet that's probably kidnapping but also it's that's negating their First Amendment right\nIf I refuse to give them a permit to speak in a public park when I get that permit to other people to speak in a public park because of viewpoints discrimination that's not respecting their first met right but in a restaurant no you don't have the right to go to a restaurant and act like a moron or any more than he was the right to go to a restaurant and play your\nYou know boom box which we used to have some you remember we used to have those in the eighties and nineties [noise] [noise] the boom box you remember he's carried around with you I\nRemember how cool you were a high school was almost directly correlated with how big your speakers were you know you want to be\nSpeakers then you were really cool I always thought little speakers were much more cynically pleasing and people like why do you like little speakers book\nAnd and one of the speakers there there was a guy there was a public pool that I Would go to 'em over the we were all sound really public but a community pool whatever that I used to go to over the summer and there's a guy to show up there\nWith and he would bring every time he was there he would bring a little outdoor speaker with him and play his weird Buddha Bar lounge music\nAnd and I just think that that's ... ... weird thing to do like everybody else the pool wants to hear your music you know that that's a bold thing to do to inflict on ever bring a Bluetooth speaker with you you can blast your music at a pool with a hundred people\nI think that's very very strange\nUm and I think that you know it's it's something that people should not do anyway back to Mitch McConnell what's going on here and this guy wisely at the Washington Post\nIs essentially a doesn't understand where the first amendment stops and starts and you see this from a lot of journalists which you think that people who make a living from the first amendment would have a better understanding of it but they're understanding the first amendment is they have special rights in privileges and everybody else needs to just deal with it\nUm but that's not the way that's not the way this is supposed to function that's not how this is supposed to go\nAnd so the Philly brains thing and it just say that were given comfort to white nationalism and we're uh I hate this talking point it's so vile it's so despicable and unfair and they keep saying all the time and it's just a way of shutting down any honest political dialogue\nWhich is why people like me and increasingly said over the last six months you know what the Russia collusion thing now they know they can't win that you're just you're just going to see that same\nThat same mentality that same insane tenacity around an issue where they think they can destroy the president\nThat's going to be a expanded to cover any number of things so that the the craziness that led them to believe that Russia collusion was going to bring down the president that same level of just was jar\nOr will now be on everything the twenty Fifth Amendment stuff the confronting people in restaurants because that was just the that was the place where you had the first real symptoms of ... from arrangements syndrome\nThe first major symptom was Russia is going to bring down the presidency it's really going to happen Trump is a Russian Jew Jenna Russian pond where it's just a matter of time before we prove it and now you see that because that's just not going to work\nThere now pushing out into everything else and you're seeing the same incentive even though we brains they're saying that you know it's it's not a big deal that people were yelling at Mitch McConnell\nRemember you know what I'm saying these people should be arrested what you're saying they're idiots and people shouldn't do this and we should be able to share that opinion without people so you get your your opinion that's destroying the first amendment no\nIs not\nIt is not and uh I I just think that this is\nOne of these places where you know you either have principles you don't abide by the way I'm not skipping over we just don't have unless you're there were there were a bunch of people that were harassing Nancy Pelosi over the weekend too and they are total moron okay they absolutely should not should not\nOr be given any respect or any you know approval from anyone I heard somebody say they were the Proud Boys I don't know I just know that

nothing to help their cause and a lot to harm it or if their cause is and I and I don't know what their causes I'm assuming it's just anti left wing something\nBut the left you are doing their huge favor no matter who you are if you say you're on the right and I know some people are talking false flag I haven't seen any evidence of that\nIf you say you're on the right and you are screaming and yelling people on the left now you give them the ability to say oh see both sides are doing it when both sides are doing it but that one case will be magnified so those individuals who are banging on doors and yelling at below sea have done the far left\nA huge favor\nI just saw the c._e._o. of global verification network last week here in DC we caught up for a while I said hey mark how's business
