you know no I can turn around and say good bye to you know\nIn swing\nAnd only a very big on its after I'm Johnny Caldera Rio three seven one three eight to\nFive five in from Michael Brown yep it's all Donald Trump's fault you see Donald Trump made us polarized and because he says such mean things the logic goes\nNow more and more people are being ugly on social media including this free job who shot up a synagogue matter of fact he said some ugly things on social media before he went to do the deed\nObviously this is Trump's fault it's going to the phones thrilled three seven on three to five five Hey Eric you're with John killed there are so glad that\nYou John how you doing this evening I afternoon I was born and raised in Pittsburgh not not that that I don't want it to the point of view I'm Sorry brass on ... or\nI or I'm going to be honest with your John I I have a hard time\nGrasping the notion that this is somehow the president's fault\nOr you you talked about this because think about the increase of anti Semitism\nI don't think any of us I don't care where you are on the political spectrum I don't think any of us believe that there isn't prejudice and bigotry not only in this country but throughout the world but you know John I have a real problem with the whole hate crime legislation\nBecause to me the fact that they hate Jews that's evidence of motive\nIt does it make killing eleven people better worse it doesn't mitigate it it doesn't compounded\nIn my argument is the argument is that it does make it worse let me let me throw up the argument then respond to it\nThe reason it's worse because he targeted to these people based on their face that they are Jewish therefore by attacking them he is making it\nA much more fearful for Ole Jewish people everywhere in the same way that a cross burning on someone's lawn might be a crime against that person that African American who lives in that home but really it's meant to scare\nAll African Americans and then that way it's a hate crime can be a response\nWell my response is two fold up first and foremost you had the shooting in South Carolina a couple of years ago at a black church OK I'm hate tends to despise religion\nPeople who hate tend not to do so except uh gifts you know I mean I guess you want to counter with certain Islamic sects but by and large hate is an absence of religion is not\nI don't know if not most religions\nYou know I don't I don't know or a because I just don't know and I there is something I listen I I agree with you I'm not a fan of what's called hate laws I I think they're overused and you see I think the danger of quote hate speech is really just to censor people\nThat being said I Will tip my hat to the notion that\nA crime like this\nImpacts a group of people more so than ... and they didn't have in mind ranger strangers in a room\nIt it is a hate crime but but the but the point I was making bringing up the whole hate crime legislation nowadays John I feel that a whole lot of crime this one excludes because of his rhetoric okay so let's let's let's acknowledge upfront\nFor more rewarding vacation tried choosing a location with the culture you are interested in then you can book accommodations that let you come in contact with the people who may if they're\nA great way to do this is by staying in a place where the kitchen such as a timeshare

may\nWell below thinks we're listening to the Michael Brown show him five Ninety to see us\nAnd I was just one room but\nSt minutes for the top I'm John Caldera in for the vacationing recovering let's just say it he's on some bender Michael Brown give me a call three oh three seven one three eight to five five seven won three talk the word is narrative\nAnd he who controls the narrative usually wins\nThe media controls the narrative\nWhat's the old saying don't get into arguments with somebody who buys their ink by the barrel that means\nThey they have a way of getting their viewpoints out it gets repeated and repeated and repeated it gets echoed because one new sources pretty much like all the other news sources even though they think they're wildly different\nAnd they all hate Donald Trump there's just no question about it which is entertaining to me because they have no idea that they're smuggling is in the media they're elite isn't there sticky sweetness\n\nIs what caused Donald Trump\nHe is a reaction to them thinking that that they're better [laughter]\nIs that the best way to put it so the narrative that the media is going to pull on this is that there wasn't any ugliness in political discourse on to Donald Trump came along\nSo as you may or may not know I run the independence Institute\nI've been in political battles now for a quarter century here in Colorado oh we do things like proposition one oh nine which you should vote yes for which gets us new roads without a tax increase\nA lot of people on the left don't like it because they would prefer the tax increase\nThe money that's coming into the state governments going to get spent one way or another but by bonding for roads it means that the future governor whoever he may be cannot take that money and spend it on trolley cars or even more Medicaid expansion\nSo I I put these things out and I'm going to tell you for the quarter of a century that I've been doing this type of stuff\nAnd it's been ugly it's been ugly I've been called every name in the book I get hate mail that would make you lush\nI ride a calm weekly for the Denver Post\nThe comments are hateful just hateful not no I I think Mr ... wrong and and here's why he says this but I really think a better point would be that no no no it's it's personal attacks\nI have a Facebook page and a Twitter page by all means at John Caldera please follow me ... Caldera\nAnd I'm Amazed what comes off of people's fingertips\nSo to have a president or guy running for office who has just been doing what so many on the left already do but forcing it out there and bringing the ugliness forward I don't find\nAs vulgar I find it\nGod should I say it almost refreshing why because we've been seeing it for decades we've been seeing the intolerance for decades so somehow and I knew this was going to happen\nThey're going to try to tie the caravan of Central American immigrants coming up a through Mexico to to this violence yes to this violence here's here's how the logic goes I heard it on NPR so you know it's got to be true\nThat\nThe guy who shot up the synagogue did so because he believed Jewish people were conspiring to get the caravan up here\nNow I have no idea if that's true or not but just just for a fact that it it's thrown out there as the motivation and this is why Trump is responsible for the shooting that's how loony this gets\n\nSo the Anti Defamation league is reporting that there are more hate crimes in the last year than ever on record\nIf true I find that pretty shocking\n\nBut let me throw out the statisticians I'm concerned it goes something like this whatever you measure you get more of\nMy sense is more hate crimes get reported since Trump has been elected because people have been sensitized to hurt\nPeople believe that Trump equals racism and therefore things that might have might have slipped by in the past\nWell they they are now hate crimes and therefore they're getting reported more you're that are there actually are more hate crimes which would be awful it'd be hard to explain that to me\nAnd I don't understand how from\nWould be the symbol of anti Semitism as one of our callers pointed out when he finally did what every other presidents said they were going to do but never did move our embassy\n\nHow was that anti Semitic helped me understand this give me a call three oh three seven won three to five five seven to one three top I'm John ... activity here\nMaybe Casey that's J.\nSprings Colorado was news of an double accurate ballots [noise]\nFive Ninety Casey has Jay I'm Helen has changed their lives gears they one of our very first customer\nHollering my own hair is easier than I ever imagined the best part I no longer had to sit in a salon and pay over a hundred dollars to have this done now I ... when it's convenient for me\nAnd it takes less than an hour people complement me on how great my tolerance and my hair is incredibly San in healthy looking experience beautiful\nMulti dimensional ammonia fried salon policy color for under twenty five dollars and joined the hundreds of thousands of women who have tried and loved Madison Reid\nFind your perfect shade and Madison dash free dot com and get ten percent off plus free shipping on your first caller can't use code trust that code trust and try and love it that's the beauty of Madison\nRead by Casey yesterday was\nDi di di di di di di\nDi di ... Fox News forty six year old Robert Bauer it's brought into court and Pittsburgh in a wheelchair the truck driver could face the death penalty\nDrew magistrate read the twenty ninth federal charges he's facing for killing eleven people at the tree of life sanctuary according to the FBI the Pittsburgh native repeatedly expressed desire to kill all Jews on Saturday\nMy thing is the man was partially elected because he is so politically incorrect and vulgar\n\nBecause that's what's been going on the left has been vulgar the left has been mean they have attacked\nI see it every day on Twitter or don't don't tell me that our site isn't guilty too yeah yeah conservatives are just as guilty\nBut there's something else though there is this this one two punch that the left gives one when they're being ugly and working on the politics of personal destruction we saw that with Kavanaugh\nWe saw what the Clintons did to their bimbo eruptions we understand how they attack people on a personal level\n\nSo they they say it's okay they give the example I should say that it's okay but if anybody tries to reciprocate then they say that's offensive\nWe put it this way so if there was a nut job on the right and he is tweeting away and being vulgar and calling names\nYes that's awful and the left will respond\nBut the left might be putting out vulgar terrible things but then they say you can't do the same you can't do the same to us because then you're a racist or then you'll vulgar order then you're dangerous\nAnd I think it's that dichotomy of\nOf act the way I say you should act don't don't act the way that I act\n\nIt's it's really ingenious when you think about it so\nThe only way you can win when you're in these battles with the left is just shut the hell up which is exactly what they want and I believe for the better part of a decade that's what a lot of America has done they shut the hell up\nIn fact I could read into something like last year's NFL\nFight over taking a need for so many Americans said forget this I'm I'm not playing any longer and people got upset now the luck would say no you're being racist and I think a lot of Americans said no I'm turning off my TV\n'cause I don't need to see spoiled brats disrespect the country for no apparent reason\n\nI think Donald Trump is a spark that says it's OK to stand up\nAnd and not be told to shut up and that's exactly what the media is doing so a guy in the Jewish community in Pittsburgh where the president is set to uh visit tomorrow says the president is not welcome\nNot until he denounces white nationalism\n\nNot until he denounces white nationalism which I'm pretty sure he's already done probably hundreds of times what you just can't do it enough in order to appease left you you got to commit Harry Carey on a stage and spill out your guts and an ask for major forgiveness\n\nShould Donald Trump asked for forgiveness should he should he say I'm against white nationalism now can I come to Pittsburgh and pay my respects\n\nWhat I don't get is it seems as though he's he's getting it from both ends it was wrong for him to move the embassy to Jerusalem so the left hated him for that but somehow he's responsible\nFor these shootings of Jewish people in a synagogue so on one hand he he was caving in\nTo the homeland for Jewish people he was caving in to Jewish interests at the same time he's anti Semitic it causes a little cognitive dissonance for me\nBut then again there are things I just don't quite understand three oh three seven one three eight to five five seven one three talk talk back and like that and get my east coast on\nSo there's an interesting website called slow facts fast opinions come and go here slow facts and I really don't know much about the guy who writes us maybe he's a whack job maybe not\nYeah asked this question after the burgers at the Pittsburgh synagogue I keep seeing this question\nHow do we stop mass murder most of the people asking this question feel strongly about things they don't understand they have not studied the issues of physical defense or contemporary mental health sorry to give them the bad news but there is no magic button\nTo fix this human condition notice he didn't say silver bullet because I Would not have worked\nHe said we can reduce it ... this was fascinating\nAh any puts out three plans and most interesting lasers third point I'll get into these after the break but it's\n\nIt's the second one that says almost\nAll mass murders are in so called gun free zone\nSo make the government strictly

Jay\n[noise]\n\n\nJohn Roberts is focused first time since the confirmation of ... capital\nYou spoke at the University of Minnesota law school\nAnd he reminded everybody that the Supreme Court does not speak for a job as or political parties that the Supreme Court only speaks for the United States Constitution yeah I Know many of you including myself are frustrated with justice chief justice Roberts\nFor his decision in the Obamacare case\nInserting himself\nClaiming that Obamacare is valid because it's a tax then because it's a tax Congress has the authority to tax and so therefore Obamacare's constitutional when nobody\nEither proponents or opponents of Obamacare ever argue that it was a tax\nSo you can take what chief justice Roberts says with a grain of salt\nBut I Do believe that it still bears merit it's that theme I've been stuck on for the past ten days or so that you could actually have two conflicting thoughts in your head at the same time and live with both of them\nAre still think the Justice Roberts was wrong on Obamacare and if you ever read if you ever really sat down and read the decision you would see that he jumped through all these convoluted hoops to make ... constitutional he actually made the argument\nOn behalf of the GOP instead of taking the government's argument at face value but by the same token I take what he says at the University of Minnesota law school and say hallelujah you are exactly correct\nBefore I sit down with professor Stein for the main event um I thought I Would spend a moment or two touching upon the contentious events in Washington of recent weeks\nI Will not criticized the political branches we do that often enough in our opinions about what I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is how it must be\nVery different\nI have great respect for our public officials\nAfter all they speak for the people and that commands a certain degree of humility from those in the ... of us in the judicial branch who do not we do not speak for the people but we speak for the constitution\nOur role is very clear we are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United states and ensure that the political branches act\nWithin them that\nJob obviously requires independence from the political branches\nThe story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence without independence there is no brown versus board of education without independence there is no West Virginia versus Barnett\nWhere the court held that the government could not compel schoolchildren to salute the flag\nAnd without independence there is no steel seizure case where the court held that President Truman was subject to the constitution even at a time of war\nNow the court has from time to time aired an air greatly but when it has it has been because the court yielded to political pressure\nAs the Korematsu case shameful Lee upholding the tournament thrown during World War two of Japanese American citizens\nThose of us on the court know that the best way to do our job is to work together\nIn a collegial way I'm not talking about mirror civility although that helps I Am instead talking about a shared commitment to a genuine exchange of ideas and views through each step of the decision process\nWhich is something that we liked him a public hearing they're able to do a behind the both the doors of the U.S Supreme Court he's about to explain to you how they do their part of it\nBut if we could just do\nIt I don't know why we can I get I mean I I get angry at people will do mastery opinions but I still like to hear their opinions because usually if you're a good listener they'll give you enough holes to drive a Mack truck through\nOr enough rope to hang them four or five times over\n... goes a long way toward just having a strange ideas\nWe need to know each step\nThat we are in this together\nThere is a concrete expression of that ... in a tradition at the court\nThat has prevailed for over a century before we go on to the bench to hear argument in the case and before we go into the conference room to discuss the case we pause for a moment and shake each other's hand\nIt's a small thing perhaps but is it is a repeated reminder that\nAs our newest colleagues put it we do not sit on opposite sides of an ...\nWe do not caucus in separate rooms we do not serve one party or one interest we serve one nation\nAnd I want to assure all of you that we will continue to do that for the best of our abilities whether times are calm or contentious\n[noise]

Saudis maintain the show he left the constantly had nothing to do with his disappearance they're walking back a little bit and saying well maybe with some rogue agents maybe it was broken boys we don't know but western mainstream media\nHave mainly been presenting to show you as a liberal journalist that opposed the regime of the purported Saudi modernizing crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nKnown as India's crown prince ...\nI'd like to know where that started is it just too hard to say Mohammed bin Salman the western narrative goes the NBS had him killed because he really wasn't a modernized to modernize riddle\nAccordingly NBS ... show you kill\nA rival analysis has been doing the rounds the show he was actually Muslim extremists the former friend of Osama bin Laden some of you submitted a picture from the Nineteen nineties of bin Laden and to show you together in some desert\nOutlive somewhere there to show you as an act collide with the Muslim Brotherhood I don't necessarily do that but he was a hater of Israel who called and all Arabs to join the resistance against it and who opposed crown prince NBS not because he was undemocratic because he was not Islamic enough\nBut even so\nWhy would NBS have to show get killed in this complicated macabre and political exposed way why does it need Fifteen men to do that why kill him at all as was also reported to show his criticisms of envy yes had been relatively mild\n\nSources that are beginning to read provide answers to some of these questions in an even more startling account\nThey say that to show he was indeed still very much in Islam was connected to the Muslim Brotherhood but much more significantly he was intimately connected to the Saudi regime\nThis is bitterly opposed to the Brotherhood he was there for the ultimate insider that had gone rogue one of the stories that I read says he was the Saudi intelligence service asset for more than Twenty years it was his report\nIn Nineteen Ninety four that Osama bin Laden was was inextricably under the influence of Egypt and the Brotherhood that convinced the Saudis bin Laden was a lost cause\nHow many if you've ever heard because all we ever hear or\nA level of the of the nine eleven attackers were from were Saudis okay\nHow many uh MS hurting gang members currently in the United states or Guatemalan I mean I think that's a fact without

he was the architect of Saudi intelligence brigadier general useful followed the Siri\nThose people had no problem with him being out of the country but he knew a lot of intelligence secrets so when he got too close to the Qataris into the Turks who are now the arch enemies of the Saudis that's when the show really cross the line\nDo you know there was fiance a Turkish diplomat is the daughter of a former advisor to Turkey's Islam was president or to want to show you started tweeting pictures of himself with while the bars remember turkey and the Saudis are mortal mortal enemies at this point\nTo show he was also planning to start to turkey sooner funded by the Turks and the Qataris\nNow if you're getting resorting Muslim center it was going to be funded by the Qataris and by the Turks piss off the Saudis the meaning of the dissenters the show he was chipping whereas llamas opposed to the attempts by India's to modernize the Saudi economy\nI'm Saudi society it is a complex you

your show like what's wrong with you my lawyer can do it why can't you and we were talking about somehow we got off on\nI think we were talking about something to do with the Senate or the house\nBut in any way I ... at any point at some point he made the comment I Love it when you are willing to say just the unvarnished truth\nAbout a Republican or a Democrat or whoever it might be and I made a and I made the comment joined kind of off handed Lee where you see it because I don't care I don't care anymore\nOnce you reach that point where you do the endless I've said this is a bunch of times before do I care about what my family thinks of course I Do I care about what Angie thanks well sometimes well okay we'll watch more\nWhat I mean by not caring is\nYou have to be able and willing to risk a lot\nIn order to gain a lot and my lawyer retort right back to me I should say retort his response to it was it's it's not that you don't care because you always do care it's just that you've been killed once and they can't kill you again and so you don't care\nWhat they think or say because they can't kill you again\nAnd that kind of feeds into the whole the whole thing the the whole monitor that you hear that you know what doesn't kill you actually makes you stronger\nWell when I made the comment about Cory bookers idea that we're going to give these poor kids fifty grand and they can use it for things for things like the down payment on a house or college tuition some people either texted me on the text line or on the set it on\nYouTube or Facebook now fifty thousand ... ... ... where do you get the idea that fifty grand is enough for a down payment on a house\nThere are a lot of places\nWhere you can buy a mansion for two hundred thousand dollars now as of Denver is a Colorado in general no is it Texas probably not but there are rural areas in Kansas Nebraska Oklahoma the Dakotas there there there are places all over this country\nWere fifty thousand dollars is double what you need for a down payment\nThe problem is is that people are not willing to take the risk because somebody said to me well not everybody can pack up and\nMove that's not true you can if you want to everybody can do almost anything they want to do that well why ever be a first baseman for the Colorado Rockies no\nI'm within the all the really the bat boy for the Colorado Rockies would I Love to be the first baseman for the Colorado Rockies in a heartbeat\nBut I'm also realistic to know that that is not a realistic dream\nBut if you have a realistic dream the only thing that keeps you from accomplishing that is your unwillingness to take risk somebody you're when YouTube just said you know what I did\nI sold my house I think I think it was different if you can scroll through the comments again but I sold my house in Denver move I think the Fort Lauderdale or somewhere bought a house twice the size had enough left over to buy a rental house and I'm the I'm Down here dumb fat and happy making money because I was willing to take the risk\n\nBut most people are willing to do that he goes back to the story I mentioned at the\nTop of the hour about this so called

and it's hard I'm not saying that any of this is easy what I'm saying is if you really want to do it you can't\nIn virtually what I'm saying is most people really don't want to do most people are

does but ... to to to ignore the elephant in the room it's just you know it's a fool's folly tie think\nOnce again to shepherd Smith the elephant in the room was Donald Trump\nTo shepherd Smith the

the room as the president of the United states and Chris what was\nHe was handing Shepard Smith is a\nFool's folly I think that it's a really incorrect to somehow hold the president\nEither by

Mr Pruitt I'm going to fact\nCheck you after reading your movie an inconvenient truth came out in two thousand and six you made the following comments as part of your\nPublicity for the the movie you sat on last week Trump quote drastic measures the world would reach a point of no return within ten years and you called it a fruit planetary emergency were eleven years later now Florence raw\nEleven years later so aren't you wrong really kept talking about the Democrats moving the goalposts on the Kavanaugh confirmations the ... moving the goalposts on climate change too\nWe now know that the fruit meaning behind the New York city climate change lawsuit is is not about climate change it's about bringing down the oil and gas industry\nJust similar efforts we see here in Colorado you think Al Gore has an answer you do oh he's got an answer All right but just if it's not to Chris Wallace is question weren't you wrong when you predicted that within ten years\nWhere now way beyond that eleven years and no\nWell we have seen a decline in admissions for the for all on a global basis for the first time they've stabilized and started to decline so some of the responses of the last ten years have helped\nOr think about the missions have the claw\nSo wouldn't there be a corresponding decrease in what ever climate change effects are caused by increased emissions\nBut uh unfortunately and regrettably a lot of serious damage has been done Greenland for example is losing one Cuban kilometer buys every single day\nSo we've reduced just take take a look I'm not this not dispute Al Gore's fat because Al Gore's Fox live in his brain and that's why\nHe admits that there's been an overall reduction in emissions so you would think that there would be slowing down of whatever climate change damage they want to point too but I don't know the alarm isn't continue\nI went down to Miami and solve fish from the ocean swimming in the streets on a sunny day\nUm yeah because the day before hurricane blown through or tropical storm and the storm surge dumped fish all over the streets I've I've seen fish on the streets in Miami\nJust as obscene fish on the streets of New Orleans\nThat crap and then the sun comes out\nAt the same thing was true in Honolulu just two days ago just from ... because of the sea level rise and now we are going to suffer the some of these consequences but we can limit and avoid the most catastrophic consequences if we accelerated the pace of change that's now beginning\nOh so for whatever reason maybe because\nKevin miles on the court and they can't really do much about it CNN decides to go all warm is\nDire warning about our home planet earth\nSay our planets only has a few years for effects of climate change the obvious and even

twelve warriors now moving to a more years\nTo avoid catastrophe it also says that he is unprecedented changes are not made and made soon there will be you reverse damage to the planet that we all share\nIs like Groundhog Day is the same story every every every decade we roll out the same old Trump and just play it all over again that dire warnings we got ten years well it's always a decade to you always got junior you got ten years to such crap or you know what we're all going to hell of a hand basket\nI've been going to hell of a hand basket for decades by\nReport focuses on what could happen if local temperatures rise by more than one point five degrees Celsius that's two point seven degrees Fahrenheit CNN meteorologist I refuse any international weather center following the details of this dire report either\nHow many times you think they use the word dire in the first forty five seconds I think at least five or wasn't Catholic but I'd say five or six times in the first forty five so\n[noise]\nSo but every nine seconds dire dire dire\nDire and they're always die or I mean we're talking about climate change here and it's really not going to be used George I think we passed the event horizon in that if we were to stop emissions today we went to zero we would still be in a heap of trouble\nThem why should we care if we're doomed which is what we're seeing him as if we're doomed anyway why don't we just enjoy\nThe arrogance to think that we're so do that even if we go to zero emissions you certainly we figure out how to\nPut a windmill in our cars we can drive eighty miles an hour down the highway then we're going to die some I don't know messy climate change of in any way that I'd say let's just let's have a party those bills go to a party brand of all let's get going\nDire warnings from the United nations more they say the world has barely ten years ago to climate change under control or the results could be catastrophic a new report says the plan and is already two thirds of the way to a climate tipping point now\nSee we were ten years were two thirds of the way which is really clever because that means every prediction over the past ten years

I mean you'd they really are in the ...\nUm when you have the entire nation a hanging on your every word of the nation divided very divided like matter what especially for Susan with all due respect I mean it's funny 'cause I'm One of my very first campaigns was in Maine in Nineteen Ninety four Jim knowingly in in up in Portland and I remember season was running and we didn't know the Ninety\nFour way was necessarily ensue in without by far was gonna wait and I remember when she won and she's a very nice woman and I've known her in some of her friends you know years and years ago\nUm but Maine is a very independent state they have an independent rights you know they've they've elected in ... governors before and um it's main yes but at the same time the elect conservative ... you know like they didn't see it as intense um\nBut it was a difficult vote for her and not just because she's up in two thousand twenty and it's you know likely to be you know a ... year more younger voters are going to turn out to vote but I Do agree and I think that um\nThe case that she made and her reasoning behind arriving at our decision today was was very well uh laid out a\n... I I Would encourage people to give them if you if you didn't see a ... let me make very clear you will see snippets of his speech on TV Tonight and over the weekend but I Would encourage listeners to go on line either go to the Senate website or go to her her ... her so the website\nWhere I'm sure it's a good fight on YouTube or something to watch the entire forty five minutes here's a woman that\nI knew them and she sort of\nA new or should we do so I knew it was going to be with us [noise] with the way she laid out who reason [noise] even dealing with the issue of doctor for the fall of her testimony viewed as a speech worth watching [noise] absolutely\nAbsolutely it wasn't necessarily partisan and I think her among\nAll we can take a break okay I Can't hear anything apparently we have to take a break ... ... ... to leave with whatever the Michael Brown will be right back\nLike twenty five wide open in directions on your drive to the city ... boulevard looking good has well fourth street is problem frantic sailing on highway the overall a nice quiet drive you should have no problem getting wherever you might be headed I'm Janine rather rent traffic\nIt's to a terrorist attack you know so I I Will respond to that I\nJust I don't either I I I cringe to think about it and you know knock on wood that doesn't happen on anybody's watch\nDo you think that that we're polarized because we really have it and I'm asking is because this is partly my theory so feel free to rip it apart\nIs that we have the sides have been pushing apart because we truly do have almost a black and white view of the country should be this versus the country should be that the vast become so\nStark that something's going to finally pushes one direction will be over for either going to end up being a socialist democratic European country right or we're going to get back to more of a free market fruit capitalism not crony capitalism type of economic system I'm\nGoing to be really honest about this okay and we do say this out of our shop we don't drink the Kool Aid even though Republican leader for him okay who I think the downturn of two thousand eight so many Americans lost their security their savings you know they're number one asset\nThey they build well no the value their home wrote on then we got thrown into two thousand eight and ... won that election in a landslide wrote exciting I think the federal a legislative session of two thousand nine is slowly and a two thousand ten with Obamacare and the AC a coming on and all of that\nReally led a fire and a lot of voters you know you know how should I say just they were physically lapsed voters are out there but the amount of seizing getting government to solve our problems are a problem created basically the majority in Congress that we have today we've been running on that for eight years\nGive Donald Trump if you don't believe that he has perhaps stoked or\nCreated some of the education that is involved in our politics for I see this in my research all the time to be honest with you I called brown where very frankly you know what do you think of President Trump to\n... I I see open ended responses and we see it in some of our focus groups where we have people saying the negativity he's so combative he won't listen to his own advisors he picks fights with everybody everybody whether he's beating up attorney general route you know the attorney general for not standing by hand and firing call me or not\nI mean I'm Donald Trump's behavior the president's ... unfortunately he goes about\nAddressing the American public and being so combative feeds that frustration and anger without question especially in the middle it makes people feel uncomfortable\nBut particularly here to Colorado you want to be honest about it\nBecause we have so many people moving here our cost of living has gone through the roof ... it is pushing or right yeah it is at the root of many of the problems that voters want salt rate today do they want to be able to afford an apartment they want it for to home they want to the cost of living go down that has them angry and frustrated\nBecause it's things beyond their control their kids or their families cannot necessarily get that\nAnd I feel that from time to time when the president is tweeting or perhaps picking a fight in his own way in his own New York wrote however you want to ... feet said agitation\nBut so that we are [noise] are perhaps more ready to pick a fight with somebody that we ever have that um ... under our current\nFrom Obama to Donald Trump to different things where ... says ... rather than perhaps try to leave with the silent majority if you will [noise] he's leading to the frustration

the emails because\n... ... really good job as you ... you you you use the word transparent earlier argument that's that's a good word I think it's just something that the average\nPerson that listens to talk radio would find informative because he'd read easy to understand it might help them understand exactly what's going on in this crazy a third third third state\nYeah and I would hope so I mean because we we do include documents that are very intense crowded as I tried to write my summers dropped tables in here and say hey here's how this breaks out by Democrat Republican independent age group\nGender you know men and women if you're just curious what to look like and try to make it a little bit easier for people to see oh that's interesting walkers leading by four points among men and among women here it's got a larger lead to a you know and so people can get a little bit beyond just straight up you know forty seven Jerry you know forty whatever for Walker\nAnd so on the way down here today [noise] uh\nI was listening to a slip between Fox News and CNN MSNBC and other whether Frank loves was quoting another pollster or water or food over somebody talked about the enthusiasm factor yes and that the enthusiasm poll you guys do\nShow that you ... among Republicans have jumped up about twelve point a there was already higher ... for Democrats but it also increase but only by about two points what do you think you ... in Colorado\nI you know I'll be honest with you I we will have a hard data on that are coming out within about ten days 'cause we we are going in the fields were going to be measuring that resenting that and I hope you know encourage people to learn that\nHere's the difference that Democrats in younger unaffiliated voters do not turn out to vote in his large numbers as Republicans do why is that\nTo be very honest with you a folks that identified they're registered Republicans tend to be older they had to pay attention more and they vote in non presidential your elections more often and just to give you an idea for example like in two thousand fourteen out of all of the registered\nRepublicans at the time and there was roughly one point one million of them sixty eight percent of them turned out to vote in two thousand fourteen Orlando non presidential election looking at Democrats though on the other hand only fifty nine percent of their voters turned out to vote in two thousand fourteen\nWhy is that well more Democrats are perhaps younger younger voters forty four Ninety or typically do not pay attention as much a turn out to vote they're harder group to turn out to be very honest with you but that's gosh that's gone back since Nineteen Ninety two when I surely identities racket has always been\nA it's more of a challenge for Democrats to turn out their voters during a non presidential cycle you\nAnd you know so but I think right now\nA Donald Trump Kavanaugh olive sort of the main forces in played at our energizing folks to get up off their couch and vote 'em\n... I feel like the Democrat intensity is coming up to match Republican city but I don't have data at this time it was a yeah it's ten points I took a hit you forget your data for a minute okay\nSo we're talking today with clarity for ... yes so we had this crescendo ... today on the cloture vote and then Susan Collins mansion coming out of a bathroom they would vote so it appears that we're going to get Brett Kavanaugh as the next associate justice of the Supreme Court that fired up\nAnger whatever you might want to call them both sides because of this confirmation process when the bell extra\nWeek of October Fifteen so really going to be getting around over Eighteen so\nWhat we what we've seen over the past few days yeah how how sustainable is that do you think\nIt will all wrote some among Republicans more than\n... for those of you are watching I'm watching the besides I've tried to see OK er road what does that really mean how much of what do you think it'll it\nMade a little bit honestly if Brett Kavanaugh had not been nominated it would've been the best\nThing happened the Republican Party cage\nThere's fewer if you if you you mean if you're not thinking for if you if you had not been confirmed to\nThe Republican base that we'd be yeah that would exceed anything by their Republican strategist greatest dreams and that's why like same sex marriage on the ballot that gets Republican voters up off the couch are very very intense voters when it comes to issues of a life and so forth um but since\nBrett is up as apparently going to make it to the court\nUm I Would say they would give a slight edge to Democrats they really have something to point you to get that unlike the opposite of absolutely just the opposite so now I think the Democrats have a slight advantage it will still far up Republicans sure no doubt about it but they're going to run with it and see we have been denied\nA woman's right has not been heard they allow it I mean I've seen stuff on Twitter today that I haven't seen a long time but I mean that is extremely rotational yeah um\nBut I think that you have to give a slight advantage to the Democrats on intensity because of\nWhat he got what we what yes so we were fired up it was like somebody\nPut into dot you're right they're going to feel like hey you know I Believe for all of those rally cry\nOr go to are gonna be like the big question is does it extend beyond for about ... you know be on the Democrats thing because you have plenty Democrat went in there is a serious with Donald Trump's presidency they're already there\nSo to hold that thought absolutely took it as ... we're going to talk about Colorado politics Linux does sound stick around Raqqa [noise]\nYou're listening to them Michael Brown\nTo Denison Fox News with three swing senators announcing their plans to vote yes it appears the Senate is likely to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh tomorrow Republican Senator Susan Collins and Jeff Flake along with Democrat Joe Manchin today announcing they will vote yes\nUm [noise] if you look at the ones that voted in the primary just so you know a hundred and Seventy five thousand of them because this was a you know the first time in the June primary wrote that they could vote which is interesting new observation for us political observers to follow a hundred and Seventy five thousand vote in the Democratic primary a hundred thousand voted in the Republican primary\nBut from our modeling data we know among these one point three million unaffiliated voters they do lean Democrat\nThey do tend to be younger um but they don't vote is often perhaps however um you know the voters that religious ... elections they do make up a solid Fifteen Percent of that they're in there\nThere are Republican women that you tend to be more moderate and will consider cancer both parties through the number of registered Democrats as a smaller number if you will um but surprisingly they're not as young as you think they're not like a bunch a young\n... they're not that millennial group that everybody kind of ... there but\nThey're in there but you'd be surprised a lot of on a ... came on the rules during the Obama administration you thought during those years that hey ah they're all going to register is Deborah these young kids are so far the first African American president roast that's not really what happened in fact there was a ton of younger voters still remained unaffiliated 'cause they didn't weren't exactly sure what they were\nAnd that kind of maintain through where it is today however what's different is like nearly fifty percent of registered voters that are forty for another in Colorado are an affiliate\nIn two thousand six that number was his lowest twenty five for so well at the expense of the Republican majority Republicans right now only make up roughly twenty two percent of all registered voters that are forty four now under\nThat used to not happened like in my days in the nineties it the Republican National committee when I was ... and so forth\nEventually when people became in their young thirties they would choose one Saturday at her you know I never mortgage I understand taxes or I have a job I'd like to keep more money or I like what they're saying about schools and you fell in one pocket or the other and the Democrat Republican parties both got their fair share if you will at least in the state like Colorado and they used to be more Republican if you will\nThat's not happening anymore in Colorado now it is just everybody's so frustrated with both parties that but you know Republicans or Democrats were like treading water Republicans are really though falling behind all you have yeah they have to have really have in the expense of at the expense of unaffiliated again\nOkay so indebted to feel you watched uh if if they are just interested to some degree did was even driving them out to vote\nNumber one issue among using the unity\nOf voters more than ... yes that's all I Do all my focus groups guess what I don't bother talking to Republicans and Democrats you know uh yeah we knew what pocket you're going to go ... unaffiliated voters they're the ones that really decide to understanding them what their fears are what they want out of their elected officials were problems they won't solve really is a big key to\nScare me which humans cycle [laughter] [noise]\nRight now it's really a tie it's number one is public education hooker especially among unaffiliated women that you consider candidates of both parties\nAre those the old saw what we call the soccer mom I don't mean to you or over but they are\nThey well they are the soccer moms absolutely because here's what they see the rising cost of living touching everything and they know thirty five thousand dollar salary teacher cannot afford to live in certain neighborhoods of school districts in our Fatah in\n... right exactly and that's why you know the the teacher movement and the you know being out there in in you know marching on the capital but not you know making their case her shirt on this past ... we need more pay\nThat's exactly what they echo because even though twenty five percent and say that's my number one issue I Want saw public education what do you want you know we always do a follow up question well that's great that means different things to people sure what she'd be done to improve it overwhelmingly in this environment is we need to pay our teachers more we need a trach for quality teachers we need more money in the classroom and ...\nWhy can't Republicans latch on because what you just said I'm Mr conservative as I can buy into every one of those things you just so\nCan only put the information out my oh we can't afford to go in that direction and I'm not saying that you know walk a staple tens campaign hasn't he pointed out a lot of areas and\nEducation or because of our elected officials in the legislature will look more towards well they're spending money so they can reallocate money and so forth\nWhich I agree with that too absolutely we do but the perception right now you have to deal with the perception that messaging and communicate directly to that perception right now is you need to speak more around that they need to pay most people don't know it's the school district perhaps that actually makes\nThe decision again not just made out of money that's number one number two residents of member to anything so you learn you know radio like getting the cloth there I'm not a veteran so they only have ... like you know yadda yadda yadda for\nYou're listening to the Michael Brown show [noise]\n[laughter]\nFunny I'm sure we're what's new

maybe not even an affiliate voters I shouldn't narrow it down to the right\nIf they don't just said everything there's plenty of ... votes up for grabs among Republicans and Democrats too if you make the case it really that is true like the candidate matters and their message truly does matter\nAnd you know I had this conversation during the break about it's really a double edged sword because a ... ... people are looking at what's happening and it's not necessarily translating to them\nOr a four point oh GDP or right this record high right unemployment\nLike my wages are up like if you are

mean and and and feel good about things or put a lot more money and you know what I'm going to even though Trump may be difficult as well I'm going to give him some credit or give the Republicans for

into me being able to buy a home if I moved here 'cause I saw how great the economy was so I moved here I'm from California yesterday I moved here from New Mexico yup and I can't do anything\nRight it's the cost of living having gone up that's why Colorado perhaps as unique I don't know if the you know people moving here okay has driven up the cost of housing\nAnd also touched a lot of other things I've seen in focus groups women saying yeah the economy's better and maybe make a little bit more money but everything else that I have to pay for has gone up to it's interesting because I'll

and put two percent roughly you know what I mean toward transportation\nWhat are you going to go for it and these are folks that are just sitting in traffic you know take some Fifteen minutes to go to

you can afford it they're like no because I'm working as hard as I can just to keep up I don't feel like I'm getting a hitter and it's in a lot of it is a tribute to in Colorado especially on the

hadn't even been through O'Hare international airport in the past year so I haven't is in fact I should say yeah for the past year because I went all way back to January and to see if I could find any

divided up the hour long presentation that she made in to see one two three four to five different soundbites\nBut this is a situation where I really do beg you to have I'm growing now really want you to listen to\nBecause if if we are to be critical thinkers if we are fully to be willing to open their minds and recognize the labels don't always encompassed what somebody is\nCamille paleo points that out to us in credible way\nThe first clue that I Want you to listen to is where she describes\nFeeling ism as she understood it and this what she describes as a second wave of feminism\nNeedless to say she has a lot of problems with second wave feminism because it's inherently based on political correctness\nHuman beings need religion they need a ... perspective a cosmic prospect down and getting rid of the office max religions because there was too conservative and simply led to the new religion of political correctness I\nMean I'm only eleven second singer she's absolutely right the dinner gracious of religion as a whole I don't care whether it's Judaism hinder was a lot of Christianity or I don't care what it is but the deliberation of religion\nBy the Marxist list\nHas been substitute that because it creates a vacuum if you don't believe in something greater than yourself if you don't believe that there is something other than just this\nVery very short period of time that we have on earth when you consider how wall\nThe earth has been in existence then you tend to want you tend to be arrogant is just like with climate change why do I think climate change advocates are so arrogant because they think\nThey substitute of religion they've taken God out of the equation and they think that somehow a public policy mandating fewer fossil fuels or more wind turbines or this or that\nIs somehow going to change what Mother Nature does its other arrogance she continues\nAnd I and and the it's the same kind of fanaticism I mean I I mean I I have found that the second wave feminists\nAnd I I don't know if the Spanish Inquisition I'm not kidding I can ... you know like any anything with that that's I mean any any form of dissent even within feminism is treated as heresy okay and and they and they actually tried to destroy you went when I when I\nWow didn't we just see that\nAny sort of dissention even within the feminist right what do they do the left eats their own and that's what she's pointing out\nThere is no room for this so there is no room for critical thinking that's what that's why when I called the well the current wave of Democrats fascist and mark says this is why\nThere was no critical thinking it's just well that is just about feeling roads I'm\nMy mind at my might be Sunday at random onion anyone there was clearly an organized campaign I'm a feminist\nGroups to get me fired from my university they harassed the president of of the university and I and I thank heavens I had tenure and I'm going off and he took them a lightning via that's on the faculty are free to express their views on anybody but if I if I were a young faculty member I wouldn't have dared to speak out okay\nI Would have been vulnerable and in in in the promotion process insulin so I just think that the independent thinkers hadn't hadn't um\nHaven't haven't been driven out of academe I'm an\nIndependent thinkers had been driven out of activity\nYou know I've sort of thousand times on this program if you've got a kid that's in college right now I don't care whether they're getting their bachelors or masters or a PHD you need to pay attention\nJust don't send them off to the university and then just expect them to come out on the other end of some sort of incredible critical thing\nYou can do all you can as you raise those kids but once they leave home and they go to college if you don't pay attention to what they continue to learn you're going to end up with one of these ... on the streets of Portland\nNot and I find him of not of men who just gave up okay I heard\nThem from a letters I've been getting for twenty five years I mean that's why one when\nI remember very clearly um new from a woman a woman who said that that she was out painting houses in in in Missouri okay and then she said that she was in comparative literature broke out program at Berkeley which is extremely on\nYour PC and so on and she said that ... every time and and there's an air seminar and that she would aggress ensues yes I'm I'm often work on a sunny day and people would look at her and said she hadn't had me had created something some offense can because of course in the new style is that you had to take this deconstruct kind of you know\nWhat she's about to explain here is so important is so here's a woman who ... who talked comparative literature at Berkeley right\nBastion of liberals she gifts denigrate because she said actually we should look constructively and critically\nA literature and the faculty was like no you can't do that well the what the hell's comparative literature about\nDebunking view of great literature and art and therefore you like you Wade into something which is ... and you would you rent pen check off you know racism and sexism homophobia and saw it I says what's happened is the universities have increasingly become a place for the times over us when he obedient from the ...\nAnd the ... and the two independents are gone\nA place where the you'll be the ... in the survivor\nWhen you hear me talk about\nHow the current wave toward social is ultimately leads\nTo a ... and the problem is exactly what this film with us [noise] if you become serve venue are afraid to speak that\nTo to come in and feel\nThat that that's what's happening to this country to do one of the we're just getting started\nExactly the same exact way to say that some of look for the\n... what's new today on the free I her radio I hardly yo\nLasts for decorating the house floor just letting the theory mood [laughter] how Republicans by the playlist has ... with the labor is why why we've\nEveryone's talking about like the fantasy football or bobcat than Joe Rogan experienced all your favorite music all

I Hope you find yourself scratching your head going ... are pretty much agree with almost everything that she says it's\n\nNot because I just want you to do with that I Want you to recognize that if you stop and actually do which is what I think\nWe'll be careful here at all I Want to be careful here\nBecause sometimes I'm guilty of this too so confession sometimes is just so easy to look at what the left is doing and I have no problem mocking\nBecause it deserves to be more\nBut sometimes it's also important to understand that even those on the left recognize that well they may have a different world view about some issue\nThere's some agreement that what's happened to the well\nIs way off base and if you apply\nWhether it's mockery are critical thinking too it it just dissolve it just dissolves like I don't know like to\n\nWatch an aspirin a bottle of coke or something\nThe important lesson for us is to recognize that on the political spectrum that rumor that you've heard me describe a thousand times Peggy Noonan came up with is that the moderate middle ... six inches\nHas moved so far to the ... which is where the ... in his what's represented by the Democratic party today that they are so far to the left\nThat a liberal not a classical ... just a truth liberal like a John Kennedy liberalism tell what Camille paleo is like like a like a John Kennedy who wants to see you know\nBigger government government doing more for its people as opposed to the smaller limited government that we want to see still recognizes that culturally\nBecause some serious problems\nShe she makes it abundantly clear in this clip where she adults the current language that you and I use to describe the wealth when she talks about current female college students\nWhen my generation arrived in college I I write\nAnd I can see foreign college and the college is still believe they had the right to an obligation to act in local apprentice in place if the parents are

thirty hours could also be conflated down into a shorter time period\nIf senators wave their time to pontificate on the nomination my guess is nobody will\nSo we'll take the full thirty hours and it will be some time around oh I don't know what I'm guessing between nine thirty nine eleven thirty our time on Saturday before we actually have a final roll roll call vote on the nomination\nAnd I think it will pass\nThe less we find out that my tweet earlier this week about Brett Kavanaugh kicking the little boys\nIn the church law after mass on Sundays turns out to be true or did he kicks

yesterday said this morning\nThat data center hardware used by both apple and Amazon Web services and provided by super Mike Rowe was actually under surveillance by the Chinese government now Amazon speech the report\nApple disputes the report which then begs the question and this is the world that we now live\nWho's telling the truth or is the truth somewhere in between with Bloomberg\nJust willy nilly report that the Chinese government was implanting chips into servers used by apple and Amazon\nI don't think so which the beggars the question of is it how extensive as apple is vehemently denying it of course I Would expect apple to do that Amazon is disputing\nThat to me those are two huge differences apple is vehemently denying that that's the case and that there are no Chinese chips on any of its servers or on any ... any of its devices I Can't open my devices up so I don't know I don't know how we tell anyway\nBut Amazon disputes the report\nI'm always fascinated by lawyers language lawyers can be so hypocritical lawyers I I Know because he was one lawyers can be full of crap they can say things that when you read it on Facebook\nOh you you look at it and you go that just doesn't make any sense that's why when\nI hear apple denying the report and Amazon disputing the report\nI tend to more believable than I Do Amazon\nOver the course of the past year apple writes Bloomberg has contacted us multiple times with clay and sometimes they sometimes elaborate\nOf an alleged security incident at apple each time we have conducted rigorous internal investigations based on their inquiries and each time we have absolutely zero evidence to support any of these allegations we have repeatedly and consistently offered factual responses on the record refuting virtually every aspect of Bloomberg story relating to apple\nOn this we can be very clear apple has never found malicious chips hardware manipulations or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any sort of\nApple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident we are not aware of any investigation by the FBI nor or our contacts in law enforcement\n\nWho do you believe you see

vote\nAnd no Democrats vote yes now you've got a fifty fifty tie Mike Pence comes in and votes yes the other scenario and Lisa Murkowski voting no\nWhich again is a fifty fifty Thai is the one Democrat decides to vote yes\nAnd that one Democrat would be Joe Manchin then Joe Manchin could be tagged with this with the rest of his political career that he\nWas the deciding vote that dragged Brett Kavanaugh across the confirmation line\nSee willing to do that I don't know\nHow do you hike camp up in North Dakota I was telling you yesterday as you're still about ten points behind her US Senate race I think has probably looked at internal polling that says she's going to lose\nSo North Dakota would be a pick up four Republicans so she's announced that she's going to vote no\nWhy would you do that if you think that Brett Kavanaugh should be on the Supreme Court or if you think the voting yes in red North Dakota that it might get you closer to winning re election\nI think she's looking at it and say no matter what I Do I'm losing I'm so far behind my challenger in North Dakota that it doesn't make any difference so I'm going to vote no so I I think you could write her off unless I mean once again once the roll call starts on Saturday who knows what they do\nKnow I don't think Chuck Schumer Dianne Feinstein will ever focus\nBut I really question mansion does he wants to be the guy does he wants to be the one senator that absent a tie where you bring in the vice president does he want to be the one to bring him all I don't think you'll do that\nHere's what I really do think will help I think Lisa Lisa Murkowski likes me all of these senators like\nThe glare of TV [noise] I think she likes being the lone holdout right now because it keeps everybody told a TV cameras around her fall I think ultimately she will vote yes [noise] and if she does that give cover for Joe mansion to do what he thinks he needs to do [noise]\nTo vote in line with his constituents in West

and trust me it's the same on the other channels to just make fun of Fox because they're my friends\nAnd so I kind of flip up the volume a little bit and I look over and Feinstein and Chuck Schumer coming out of the house or the ... minority leader's office and they walk over to the the likes of cameras\nAnd Feinstein talks first\nIn the first thing she starts doing his ... about\nThe cover up and the lack of an investigation she's disappointed that you know everybody can't see the document that's been produced in the the review this morning and I ... and I'm thinking seriously\nAnd and Chuck Schumer says especially the same thing Chuck Schumer started greatly on the fact that you know that this was this was a sham just just doesn't make any sense it's a it's a bunch of old August

they're guarding murder liability\n\nAnd here's the latest fourteen and Fifteen year old cannot it's no longer up to a prosecutor it's not up to the prosecutor based upon the special circumstances of a case\nTry a fourteen or Fifteen year old as an adult\nIn murder case in fact now in California if you were fourteen and Fifteen Years old\nSo here's a good here's good news roller view him as Thirteen gang bangers ... you cannot be tried as an adult for any crime including murder\nSo if you're a fourteen or Fifteen Years old and you're a member of MS Thirteen and you decide that it's time to go out and take a ... to somebody's head and decapitated them\nOr you decide to go out and gang rape some poor little girl and then stab or forty seven thousand times and didn't chopper head off just for good measure\nYou cannot be tried as an adult\nNow I haven't counted how many people\nAre in California state prison serving life for murder forty fifty probably I don't know\n\nI can think of only three that were committed when they were Fifteen Years old or fourteen years old they were all stone cold killers\nBut the story of one of the fourteen year old was was one of the first monsters you could imagine he and his Fifteen year old co defendant committed multiple shootings in the weeks long crime spree that terrorizes Long Beach about nine or ten years ago\nNow people like that\nWill be held in a juvenile facility into their early twenties at the ... of the outer limit and then they will be released back into society multiple shootings in the weeks long crime spree in

released when they reach twenty Twenty one years old that's reform that's what California's sees as reform\nNow I Know if you've got a Fifteen year old you got a fourteen year old you may be thinking to yourself oh my gosh thank goodness I Hope they do that in Colorado because I Would not want my fourteen or Fifteen year old tried as an adult\nYou know as a parent a grandparent I get that\nBut the realization should be some fourteen and Fifteen year olds commit heinous crime they don't have to be members of MS Thirteen I I was court appointed to prosecute or not to prosecute to defend to fourteen year old\nBoy that raped a little twelve year old girl and the prosecutor even though I thought I believed it was right prosecuted those two as adults\nThat only did they write the little twelve year old girl they ended up killing\nI'm not convinced the killing was purposeful but it was a killing committed in the active another fellow\nThey just Bangor around so much and the covert you know metal covert that she just died for injuries I think those two little dirt bags oh yeah\nThey were convicted I ... I made sure they got a fair trial make sure they got a fair trial but I think they're still in prison as quite frankly they should be\nCalifornia's then something else too they become they ... they have now become the first state to require a publicly traded company to they must have women on the board of directors\nThe law requires at least one female director on the board of each California based public corporation by the end of next year you know they need up to three female directors by the end of twenty Twenty one\nI'm all for diversity I'm all for finding the best people\nI suppose they get around it now by finding men ... women and those men who identifies women could then claim yeah I'm On the board of X Y Z Corporation identifies a woman [noise]\nNo just during the quarterly bored me [noise] what else are we going to be well why don't we just had the government just start running businesses altogether how 'bout that just just all you've business owners step aside that the government run your business\nThe Michael Brown show continues after this [noise]\n\nRadio makes our job's easier we'd like to thank the folks DNS Bain center in downtown bubble for listening paradise on the south side and the ... convention center all for having us on when we were there and we hope you're enjoying high heart radio it's so were they may\nDay die on your mind that and I guess that's all I have got the Iranians\nAnother chance for you to win one thousand dollars coming up with five after the our ... our Monday through friday ... need to be I'm right\nHere some Broncos why [laughter] yes\n[laughter]\nSunday Monday channel way Broncos radio network what blows Fox Sports Thirteen fifty I hardly used to show up or down some on your favorite I hard radio station\nLive human program is probably better we can see that I'm aware of the year ...

Kavanaugh\n[noise] herring\nYou noticed that the other thing that fell off the news cycle that meeting that was supposed to be held a week ago today between Rod Rosenstein and President Trump which\nThey called off because that hearing was being held west but we could go Thursday and clearly Trump didn't want to be interrupted while he was watching the hearings and he certainly didn't want to fire or heavy anything take away from the news of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo Rod Rosenstein lived another week whether he will live another week or not remains to be seen\nNo Baker being the top lawyer the FBI\nIs the guy that would help secure the ... world's on quarter pay as well as the three subsequent renewables of the ... war no prior to the deposition the Republicans said they believe that Baker would explain why information\nObtained from Christopher Steele that was behind the ... you see we haven't used the term Russia Ducey a Christian steel Peter Struck screw ... they will use those names words in ten days and then all of a sudden boom the right back in the new\nSteals a pair of bias against Trump all that was withheld from the Pfizer court and apparently he gave information as to exactly why it was helping the flies accord Fox News asked Baker ... about the deposition about the handling of the Trump does do you\nWhat he told Rosenstiel about exculpatory evidence they ask you what they thought he was the subject of FBI investigation leak and he told Fox News obviously he was not going to and could not answer those questions\nSarah Sanders told reporters that the meeting remains limbo between the president Rod Rosenstein\nSlipped back in the news you see it's a never ending circus in Washington DC here's my fear though about the investigation being conducted by the house intelligence committee in the house special of the house select committee on investigation my concern is this\nJust Republicans lose the house next month those investigations will virtually vanish\nBecause if you don't have the support of the house leadership if you can't go to the house will if you can't go to the house majority leader if you can't go to the speaker and say we'd like to issue subpoenas to do this or that\nThe investigation just language\nSo after me this if the house Republicans lose to the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi who apparently it's not going to be challenge or she is going to make any difference if she ends up being speaker\nMaxine Waters who are being house majority leader which is not going to happen but wouldn't it be fantastic\nIf if you look you've republic if you're if Republicans have to lose him closely has to become speaker then I went back seem to be the house majority leader\nThere should be on the news every single day and you know there it it wouldn't take the ten days before she could stick her foot in her ... her foot would be so far down her mouth that we could pulled out a rear end she could scratcher but with her foot\nPole of those investigations will disappear and voted best ... we'll start oh let's see the New York times which is laying the credit for apparently Fred Trump may have violated some tax law\nForty or fifty years ago you wouldn't\nHave both stature limitations has passed on that\nI also find it interesting that then I look I printed out the New York times story about the the whole the whole ... thing I haven't read it yet I Can't get motivated to read and I can't get motivated to read it because we're talking about something that happened decades ago that again is beyond the statute of limitations\nAnd there's a fine line between tax avoidance and tax evasion\nThat the New York times throws around the word tax evasion a lot and Donald Trump says he scored a threat is threatening to sue them I'm not sure there was a public figure he has standing to do that but the state of Fred Trump might have standing\nBecause even though he did you stay to play with the New York times is fueling the character Fred pro and Fred ... is not a public figure I saw that with the Democrats [noise]\nTechs make a little piece of your mind send your message alone with his name Mike

makes a huge difference snake we are seeing in eighty percent of the students that have a mentor their grades improve\nTheir attendance approved and improved and their behavior\nImprove why as well and so it's just somebody that is willing to listen you don't need any special skills you don't need to be a tutor if you forgot algebra long ago don't worry about it now than they do all you need is

Fox News President Trump in Florida for the first I'll be eleven rallies in eight states boxes that Iran has more live it hurts arena outside Fort Myers\nAnd the thirteenth amendment the fourteenth amendment which does a whole bunch of important stuff including that and of course the fifteenth amendment which says that the right to vote cannot be a bridge based on race so\nI'm I'm trying to understand what it is that they were trying to achieve back in what was Nineteen Eighteen sixty eight with this amendment ... it was it so that anybody who immigrated here and had a baby would become a United States citizen\nKnow the primary thing they were trying to achieve with this particular clause along amendment issue as you know John were just talking about the first sentence of it which is called the citizenship clause its purpose was to ensure that African Americans\nWho were born here even if they had been slaves were uh were treated us citizens as you know of the United states and\nJust for refreshing my my history even those slavery was legal until the thirteenth amendment importing slaves was against the law correct at a certain point\nThat's correct and that raises a whole host of very interesting issues because anybody who is important between Eighteen away when the slave trade was made illegal and Eighteen fifty six when slavery was abolished\nThat person was an illegal alien and um you would think at\nColorado not of not of his own shoes and all of his own but he\nBut he's in the country illegally and so you would think that Congress would have taken that into consideration but\nHere where there are a lot of I'm Sorry with a lot of slaves who were smuggled into the United states after the ban on importation of slavery well did you\nFind a lot I I don't know that anybody really knows me knows no certainly that their worst touch person and that they're not and that their presence was known about but the people who drafted the fourteenth amendment you know they they weren't like the founders of the U.S\nUp the founders the people who wrote the original constitution were extremely precise\nAbout the language they use their extremely competent draft a lot of people who tell you out there that language and the original constitution is vague it generally is not about the fourteenth amendment was not as well drafted\nAnd so I'm not even sure that the people who drafted it really knew what the phrase\nSubject to the jurisdiction meant in completely they they did understand that if someone was let's say born an Indian tribe out in Montana Territory before it was a stay at that person would not be a citizen I understood that\nAre they understood that someone who was born in this country was African American even if he or she had been a slave would be a citizen\nBut I don't think that they fully thought through all the implications of what subject to the jurisdiction there of means and for the Supreme Court has had to struggle with that phrase on two occasions\nAnd only two occasions as this is a law that's been around for what a hundred and fifty years or an amendment and it's only been looked at it from the Supreme Court twice\nExtraordinary isn't it a but there's a lot of\nThere are a lot of permission of the constitution like that\nBoth of the cases that interpreted that language subject to the jurisdiction there off off of um arose in the latter part of the nineteenth century one held that I'm a Indians who were parts that were members of tribes\nAre out in the territories that they were not citizens you know they they were later granted citizenship by statute but they were not subject to the to the jurisdiction of\nThe United states for first up there 'cause that's that's fascinating yeah fourteen amendment and the fourteenth amendment that that just wanna make sure I'm I'm up this we will so when the fourteenth amendment passed\nIt did not apply to Native American Indians and that later on by an act of Congress they\nWere made into citizens but even even those people who were born in American territory because they were on a reservation where they they were an Indian uh territory they weren't citizens of the United states\nThat's right the tribal tribal members okay I mean if somebody was it in their involuntarily left the tribe and came to you know be an American citizen that that was different\nBut I Try tribal Indians were not citizens the second case dealt with the question of the children of illegal immigrants\nOr what happened here was that there was a Chinese couple living in California in San Francisco they were here in this country illegally and they had a son and then the son left the country to go visit China came back and the immigration authorities wouldn't let him out and they said you know you're not a citizen\nAnd the U.S Supreme Court said he absolutely a\nCitizen or that because he was born by legal that's right and what it was that ruling they\nSet those uh that that's a Eighteen eighty four and so that I'm a that decision held that people who are in this country illegally ours are in what the what the\nRob you're gonna have to hold that thought

Congress could similarly interpret all the phrase as yet a team's best but the ultimate decision has got to be up to the courts\nOkay so I haven't heard\nPaul Ryan say this would be a question for Congress\nCould he doesn't he doesn't really know either does he\nKnow he doesn't it could be a question for Congress and and if Congress reaches an interpretation one way or another it's possible the

you'll forgive me call three ... three seven one three eight to five five seven one three talk\nSo surprise surprise when the experts on television tell you the president does not have the authority to do this with complete certainty does not have the authority to\nDo to make sure that\nPeople who come here and have a baby who are here illegally that baby can't be a citizen of the answers we don't know the courts haven't looked at it since the late Eighteen hundreds\nAnd that whole little of jurisdiction phrase has a lot lot to do with it so the beating force if they have a baby year according to the Supreme Court ruling back then those people were not citizens\nI'm not convinced this is a slam dunk he can't do it the way that the New York times and NPR will tell you it's going to the phones three ... three seven more than three eight to five five to Denver we go Mike you with with me John killed era\nSo like I I Would love to see a lot more background\nThat the example that Nader sing gave about uh the rescue boats\nTaking a pregnant woman on a like to know more history about when that sort of thing came up\nAs it always I mean I don't know that we can gauge in rescue operations that long and ... as it was it sort of default because the anchor baby concept was already kind of ingrained and so they just people that did that or is there some actual legal reason for it the latter\nOr get it at the southern ... it's not there for a second I think the point of what Rob Nielsen just taught us is that\nWhole legal principle\nHasn't been challenged to the courts for for a resolution since the late Eighteen hundreds so anything that the president does\nCould start the ball rolling on what that really means so even by him making such a pronouncement via executives I'm\nAn executive order it could result in clarity on what the Fourth Amendment means as far as citizenship so I don't I I kinda hope he does it\nAnd and then just to be clear as far as the less concerned there is nothing this president can do that he has the authority to do\nYet in resident before he put in more executive orders and the other ... yesterday I think yeah it was fine\nOr aid even be in there right now yeah so uh but the last word in that sort of settings paragraph wherein they reside that reside word also strikes me you know if you're here on vacation you don't reside here\nThat's why the the reasoning for it applying to slaves of course they reside here this was their their home at least you know it had been for quite a number of years they didn't just happen to be walking through on a on a vacation\nAnd that reside anyway I just\nThink that well I had my I I think the resigned regular I I think that refers\nTo pardon my my English at the nuns taught me but I Believe that means of the state so in other words it says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and the here's the fund raise and subject through the jurisdiction there of meeting the jurisdiction of the United states\nAre citizens so this is the other part of the sentence they are citizens of the United states and of the state where they reside which means that if you reside in Colorado your Colorado citizen if you write and I didn't\nKnow what if you're just you're on vacation and you have a baby you don't reside here you just happen to be standing on\nThat right by the phrase or moment I I miss the time when when I was a kid the nuns would have us um graph out sentences you have to do a graph you have to do this you do these lines and so\nThe where of has to do with being a state\nBut that that doesn't come into play unless you are a citizen subject to the jurisdiction there up so if you're not a subject of of jurisdiction therefore you're not as a citizen in the United states then that last phrase and of the state where in the reside wouldn't apply to that person\nGraph right up to ... and it becomes you know\nThey could have just as easily left out that whole section of and subject to the jurisdiction there they they wouldn't have put it in there if it meant\nAnybody who has a baby on the soil it's completely redundant to put it in there if that was the meaning\nIt must remember when this was ratified when this was ratified at Eighteen sixty eight it's not like you could jet on over here to drop your baby off of it to get here was in or\nDeal or unless you live right on the ... or do I do like cat Canadian or order you know neighbors right but even then to make that try to make the trip back then was not was not an easy thing so\nIt had more to do is slavery that it had to ride with within ... knows\nAnd those people live here anyway I just I think it's a to think that the anchor baby concept applies I think flies in the faith that negates any other immigration law you can have it just makes\nNo one's taking or taking my call let's see if we can squeeze out an anti really fast and then we got less than a minute you're with John

board is with the county clerk and you can fill out an affidavit as to what your addresses\nAnd you can probably cast a provisional ballot or more than likely if you fill out an affidavit under penalty of perjury that you live at such and such place you live in that particular house and Senate district you live in a particular congressional district\nYou're probably going to be allowed to vote\nIt just means that you have to make your next trip so while you're making your trip to the post office to pick up your government check or whatever else you're picking up\nYou can just walk

United Way how are you young lady I'm doing great Nick how are you good good to see you and you've got the good stuff coming up we're talking mentoring so we need All right\nYeah we are making our big push to recruit carrying positive adult role models right here in ... to spend one hour week with a struggling middle school student in our United Way middle school mentoring program\nAll right so what are the qualifications or what do we need\nWell you just have to have a listening here you have to be a positive adult role model course pass a background check so but when we ask if you spend an hour a week with a student and one of the five middle schools that were at and that you less than that you provide that support\nInformation and advice on life skills that you can share and the hours typically around the lunch hour so if you're working individual and you can get out for lunch\nAt spend quality time we've seen that it really makes a difference in the student achievement in academics in their behavior attendance but what's harder to measure but we really see a lot of strides with is in their school engagement and our overall felt the same because Nick do you remember when you're in middle\nSchool ... horrible so horrible yeah\nIt just makes me feel sick when I think about it and so so many of these kids and they just come from families that maybe they don't have support or maybe it's a single family household and they need that additional\nPositive adult role model just a little extra encourage me and it really makes a difference and it's a bond that's forged um that I think is not only benefit beneficial for the mentor but also the person doing the volunteering\nOkay well I'm thinking back eighth grade that was what the toughest three years of my life [laughter] actually yeah so you're looking for people from all walks of life yeah run all walks\nOf life and we we are really putting a target on business people and the reason is is just people that are in the workforce but will we love retired people as well is that so they can explain and demonstrate how school help them and their specific job because if you remember in fifth grade you're like what the heck does algebra\nHappened in New York I live I still think [laughter] I Wonder\nWhy I think I should have paid more attention in algebra I couldn't figure out how to lay this all the ... naturally\nSo it's really kinda to show the students at how school goes into future life and in their jobs and and just not only that but just life skills player you know how you become more organized the kids in the program are smart kids that's for sure you just\nNeed a little bit of help to them chewed up up yeah may\nMaybe I give them advice on how to be more accountable responsive but these are smart kid they just need a little ... and all of you you're thinking I Know it when you open up the paper you're\nOut there thinking how can I help them level of youth this is a great way to do it one hour week during the school year it's safe it's monitored and we do field trips to as well to create Bonnie this is a way that you can make a meaningful impact in our community because this is our future and you\nKnow I Know in the past you needed more males is that still the case\nYeah we typically need about sixty percent males and forty percent females because we we see that that typically mostly in in that's the breakout because just the the blaze you know they need a little bit of extra help so we need a lot of men that are willing to step up\nAnd and be that positive male adult role model but of course we we use females and our gladly are able to accept them\nNow if somebody wants to do this what how do they sign up\nSo I'm In a direct them to our website Diablo United Way dot\nOrg slash mentor good information there they can sign up they can apply and again you just have to pass a background check we do an interview with the perspective mentors just to line them up with the student that we think they'll let you have and then we do a training just to give a\nProse on and plates on how to best interact with the kid but if you can listen you can do that it's not a tutoring program\nIt's just that positive adult\nRole model ... which we all probably have somewhere in our past\nYeah have you back you know we all know there's so many that made a difference I mean even outside of our parents teachers yeah sure something like that and I still have mentors and if I didn't have mentors I just can't imagine you know when my life could be said they they always make an impact\nWell there you go if you feel that in your heart's again well the United way dot org is that\nGreg last mentor yet you can go in there and check it out and we're happy to answer any questions as well or they can that give us a call I teach you five eight five eight the role as well\nI bet lots of information on on the website and we laughed all had to be a part of our mentors are amazing people there are busy they uh care and and for them to donate their time is really humbling\nAnd mentors I've talked to their rewarded as well they may feel great about it they hate to see the end of the school year\nI said yeah they do so yes we really encourage if you want to make a real difference in my view the United way minutes commenting programs the way the gap\nOr do you need

[laughter] yeah I'm\nVintage NASA\nVox dot com the headline is the Senate represent states not people that's the problem\nIs up heading is states as states do need representation\nIn the federal government but under the constitution they have far too much well in that a cropper malarkey\nYeah I wanted to say something else there\n\nBut of course the fact that the constitution does something isn't the same is that something being good we continue to debate the constitution itself and specifically the disproportional Senate\nYes our intuition tells us that there's something wrong when a minority has that much power we should pay attention\nThe sin is equal representation of states not people should be discussed\nOn its merits I don't think it stands up\nThis is one of the ... too but his articles I think I've ever read why do you think we have two senators\nFor every state because the Senate was supposed to represent stay in the Senate no longer represents states the Senate now represents the entire population of a state\n\nThe whole idea behind the Senate by behind having a bike ham role legislature or lower house an an opera house\nWas based on one simple fact that I think most Americans don't know\n\nThe federal government didn't form the states the state's formed the federal government the states are supposed to be\nOver the federal government\nExcept in those areas where the Congress and the constitution gives the federal government certain enumerated powers the idea behind a by camera legislature was that the lower house would be divided among the several states\nSo that the population would be represented\nProportionately so that individuals\nCould be close to their representatives that go to Washington to represent them for example the population of Colorado has increased so substantially that we will probably get an additional idol thing too but at least one additional congressman after the next\nSince some states have one congressman still have two senators\nBecause the idea was you wanted to equalize out heavily populated state\nWith less densely populated state\nAll the power to start spending money to raise tax was supposed to start in the house of representatives so that the people if we get pissed off enough which we don't get pissed off enough", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dan Caplis Show", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "16",
