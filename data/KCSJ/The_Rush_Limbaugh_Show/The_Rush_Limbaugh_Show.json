said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have the Mayor Bill Clinton was very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you but um there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's\nAbout something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're

dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that and all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of

grew up\nI mean it's hard time I grew up with ... and maybe it's because I I mainly grow up and military synagogue my dad was in the air force but there was never politics never came current events did but not politics\nLet me ask you this is it's not like me ask you this ... in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in your appearance that opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they but they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't couldn't I said that they were I mean because what I'm going to\nSay that yes because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're really they're willing to claim the victim had but nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nWell the one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThe ... it it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there's there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and do quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti that religion is not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's it is a religion in time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from the religion I don't think you can and it's you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal\nYou're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes out now with the disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel's doing that yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a book 'cause if they're inside the religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] but um yeah but I I don't\nI used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheism and you see that they're anti Christian too um I don't see them as necessarily\nBeing assuming Islam but I mean you know but I Do the it's a it's anti God\nThat's exactly right I was wearing Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes image judgmental isn't right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else it bears no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's X. men one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I just I'm so how this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say but you are\nThere's all the liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's any Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it\nSo this has been in Pittsburgh than it does it add to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't and I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there are targeting\nA Jews in a way that they would want to go she'd have to think about I think that this is these are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nUm I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous\nAnd it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything silly like that\nGlad you because I'll tell you\nThere's a lot of people that think and they're predominant bite thank you thank you so much Rachel I purchased racial ... Thousand Oaks California [noise] um\n[noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do a lot of people think it's\nGoing to dampen a turnout what you you would think I'm wrong or you\n\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by Senate Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nWell there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in ... fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump\nI have I have an\nEntirely different which is why I did the show opened today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nEnd of the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it has this happens to these two events come along and they I this is that this has to be what it is their thinking\nAnd they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking the president\nWhat he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible\nAnd what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how it's Washington the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be\nPunished is where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern government as an agent of power\nTo enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes place a Web says\nWhat's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponent Congress writes the laws but the idea that Washington should be able to\nPost I Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American\nViewers are looking at in terms of murder\nI don't want to add a lot of the reason I was a murder\nYou know here's what I said ... yeah he is responsible\nFor fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out oh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for a ... looking at him as a murder we didn't say that no we didn't see that Matthew Dowd but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that led to emerge\n[laughter]\nNo they are so they they when when they're when they're confronted with what

small part\nIt's kind of amazing or a last question I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repair this relationship where do you see him going forward just doing exactly which weren't so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's a failure in these horrible news or something ... and if something is but the bottom line is\nThese crowds of a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere ... what do you see them doing going forward\nAnd if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if they walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing hauling the press is not going to happen and that's because it's interesting it's not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision\nTo go to war with the media\nBut but now that the media has made the decision to go to war

result of the shooting incident\nIn the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the caravan that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let and it's the wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid germs at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen\nCan't pin it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever know whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in place\nActive on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurts\n\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump with their stories earlier this year about how he\nSeparated families the border and how Trump didn't like the narrative and didn't want it but last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans at look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one the issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right where would they would be mightily disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles I also\nThink if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell [noise] I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human the fate [noise]\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border may cause they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those are very real limited that's over for three months\nAnd the objective is to show up\nRight as the polls open on mid term election day\nSo if they had been walking\nFor what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of course a ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox News in the a P report that a second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already crossed into Guatemala\nThey're hoping to catch up to the main group\nAs the massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing to join the main group which reportedly and swelled its ranks with several people who've already been ... or did the caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on the more again Monday morning departing the southern may cause city of tapping Chula the smaller group trailing entered walked a mile away from Honduras late Sunday according to the aid pay\nSome in the second the caravan are said to have experience in getting across\nThe border with includes a number of deportations have some of whom have been sent home multiple times\nEight twenty nine year old the inner Anthony ... is reportedly was deported for the six time from the U.S five months ago said they catch you and you're trying to get back he has a son and a U.S citizen girlfriend living in Birmingham, Alabama according to the Washington Post\nJust like that which occurs every day and has been at the southern border for many many decades I mean it's it's an invasion that has so far\nLead to a minimum twelve million illegal aliens of the country and these incessant calls for amnesty for all of them\nBut let's see what happens when they are supposedly a week out let's see if the organizers\nOf this thing began to deny the members food and water\nLet's see if the people behind this creating a humanitarian crisis one week before the Irish jeweler rival\nOh my God\nLook what's happening it's in the middle of the Mexican does or doesn't they've gotten out of water and there's no for my we've got to do something we got to do something\n\nThere is a hurricane coming that Mike oh well it's a perfect storm that couldn't be\nComing to fruition here this is the ultimate\nOctober surprise that we're still trying to figure out who's behind this here's let me go from Texas He was on today with the Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us\nWhat you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way to the border\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats and Democrat name Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents ten Nineteen sixteen after ... gangs came across\nThe border New Mexico and killed a bunch of people not only did he four Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's I'm going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs me stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to remember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim\nAnd Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the the way I talk to the Louis he'll talk about Jeffrey is talking to Jeff and I don't even know who these types of who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions Jeff Sessions or big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points\nThey already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country and if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary mover is behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises its eventual waiting but I think this is the left behind it\nFor a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review and we're back great to have your Rush Limbaugh kicking off a brand new weak and broadcast excellence here an eight hundred to eight to ... to eight eight to [noise]\nOne more of an Louie Gohmert he is from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill cameras says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply conservative violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of and by the way the the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night\nIs it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nWho right mind would want this who when their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they've they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nOne of the world is so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration\nOf how soft this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the\nElderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest they're being driven solely by emotion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a masked a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and saint of the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't been here for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nCom\nFormulate your [noise] dominant gets to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah a lot of people worked up\nAbout that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nAh there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence from up by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because of positive comments out for\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections [laughter] what if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do\nStand aside for seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms\nOf it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because\nOf the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized has the border if they bomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address\nPut everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean I think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is about the people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can't try to deal with this on his own he needs to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on\nTape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends and we will continue as we always\nHave to get them off\nTo Russian by be Mitt and work\nOn the radio on to win\nDot com [noise]\nMy friends I enjoy things that are well made take cigars for example the details are what matter a proper assembly properly rolling the cigar is central for a good draw the

still volumes pickles catch most or many of us we see coated [noise]\n\n\nWell we have some interesting calls way and then you hear a false in a couple up there a couple of callers really really\nWorried about this after Trump's not going to be able to stop this and that the military\nIsn't trained for this and we have some people on the phones or think this could go south\nPretty fast and wreck and ruin everything we'll tackle this\nAnd much much more when we get back after an obscene profits time out ...\nYears ago making a murderer became less the TV show then a force of nature and veto uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice and\nIt was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan gassy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to overeat budding emerge\nMounting a murderer is now in the ... radio as to when the fog\nOnline at ... dot com and on your phone with our ... radio lab\n[noise]\nHeartbreak in Pittsburgh I'm Joe ... in the morning has begun in Pittsburgh after eleven\nTo know what's good for you which is how the left looks at the body politic in general it is how the left it's how Obama it's how Hillary Clinton deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton can says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past him kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to\nPromise to do this that and the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are elected properly in Tampa David they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support it but able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to their Jim Acosta\nIn Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside just roaring\nAnd cheering and having the best time they've had in a week or longer and he can't stand it\nAfter all his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you keep falling for the lives and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gotten so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore\nBut what is troubling as to what behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now is as to who believes and he does it I think because it still works instill rile people up that divides us horribly yeah\nOh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes is\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump has been working is spend like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers hey resent the hell out of Trump Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you\nAre which takes me to one piece that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to a David go lurk near brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science but we have cited his work countless times on this\nProgram over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the ... way\nBack when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate ...\n\nAnd let me give you some quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating\nIn for a reason most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming\nAmerica's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased\nPrint says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist\nFor future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten and this is so\nRight on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has none left\nAs this or go larger says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain\nDestruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again\nFor now though the ... only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America\nThe implications here are important and they're painful\n\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America it does folks\nNothing every leftist hates America but the leftists either no right to alert and her at all they do hate Trump\nThey hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectuals they hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all he doesn't have any ... except getting the job done\nHis goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself\nInvents and uses I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate\nHis certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many people\nAre just not right and everybody has their you you just don't wait too you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am\nI Know your full of it fine no you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this and you'd be doing the right thing they can't stand\nThat they love equip vacation they love people see the both sides of the things they he reaching\nOut with the heart they hate certain movie especially when it conflicts with their\nOwn now back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities guidelines women\nDoesn't see the need to apologize for it\nSometimes he's treated women disgraceful aid for which Americans left in Ryder ashamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but Gartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America\nI'm Sorry about the ...\nOf ... constrained average American Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself a losing sleep over it\nThe difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with him\nWhether they love are merely tolerating comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer the factory hand the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife\nLeftist intellectuals I Know say they dislike such people in so far as they tend to be conservative Republicans\nDonald Trump was elected president by a significant electoral college margin\nThey can't win these elections that they've been hoping and praying to win ever since all these special elections now the midterms coming up we'll get another lying to themselves about the future are going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do with it they're going to investigate Trump\nNancy Pelosi can't help herself she's bragging talking about the subpoena power is that really what the American people want they want Donald Trump and the people that work for him brought up under investigation for two years instead of real life on the ground improving the way it is\nIs this what the Democrats in media really think it's just what they're left wing candidates really believe\nThat the American people are so filled\nWith a range Donald Trump and his administration they want all of them investigated they want all of them put in jail they want the truth to come out the Trump cheated against Hillary with\nRussia they're still obsessed with this stuff they're obsessed with the fact that this election was they're stolen\nFrom them and now it's time to make it All right\nAnd they are convinced you what Trump investigated to aunt there just to be tied to heaven persuade you to join them so now you're part of the problem\nAnd so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation that consists of a majority of angry deranged\nLunatics in order to get what\nThey the media and the Democrats want that's what they're trying\nTo create right in front of our eyes radio ... practically an inspirational post I Want to\nPossess the character that that is non green weeds are you guys thought he might be that ninth grade we southern again try our new nine green wheat sounds to me John sweet yeah freak yeah it's\nDifficult to find a person in America right now whose life has not been impacted by the opioid epidemic in fact a recent report found that enough off the lights were prescribe in two thousand sixteen for every man woman and child in the nation to have thirty six till\nFiction is taking a toll on millions of lives across America but together we can reduce the devastation and worked and addiction and it all starts with prevention\nNow more than ever this important that we educate and empower patients to talk to their doctors their post surgical pain that [noise]\nWe can reduce

okay so I'm not against or the ... at once again I sincerely appreciate everybody holding on we're going to start in a viable Ohio David Europe first that I hire\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening to\nNPR and Steve as a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the hardest jobs in the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mom they use what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's not when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nThat there's you know thousands of people on the line went on they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so ah your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you wonder what the enemies doing or what they're up to that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can\nThat uniform we've got a bad we got a a a a bad a connection here uh about the only time I read or sitting NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said oh for the audience and\nAnd that happens when I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA ... but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\n\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and a ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day as I Believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings they give you just have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know and so me screw with Trump Trump's Hitler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge ...\nRamos or whatever it is it is what does he tell among do ... what what what is in ... Illinois but what does it Univision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob\nWhere packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks\n[laughter] they don't look like they're kind of people you'd want to run into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's ... he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want us a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and let them in the all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are the peak of humanity these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this much which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nIn these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye of the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats booked asked about the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\n\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats on immigration as a loser for\nThem\nMemo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win all never gracious vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most draconian of Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border\nAnd threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has

starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard up but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like that where they didn't want it to last and so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gamut is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not\nGoing to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right where they would be my only disappointing particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody\nHas to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two\nThousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states since ... Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTwo thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and it'd be one of them start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think but I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams of what would the environmental wackos thinking about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the ... in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human PC\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to get her I just hit the southern border may go they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many miles\nA day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next\nDay that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen\nVideo of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand\n[noise] and\nThen of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox News ... ... S P report to the second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and\nHas already crossed into Guatemala they're hoping to catch up to the main group\nAs the massive migrant caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing\nTo join the main group which reportedly and swelled the ranks with several people who've already been deported the caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on the move again Monday morning departing the southern may cause city of ...

this morning bill hemorrhage says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence pond pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when we have a\nParty a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this un wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe\nHave somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging at a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest are being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help the benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having them may I ask a bunch of experiences there\nIs no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever we may as well not have any\nBorder if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just a race to the border and say to the world come\nOn it because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning anything\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to hurt gene point advantage

attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer out\nWe're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned about this ... saying that we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because a positive comments out is look\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what window Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou didn't you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized just a border that if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and\nPut everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bringing back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean I think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else's but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is it a whole lot\nOf different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get off\nTo Russia by be Mitt work rain\nRussians

play\nIn the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're individual you're sort of very good at it\nThat wouldn't be enough okay what about this what about the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and what\nWas the end of the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you know you and your like you you don't use bullet you use a ... one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force not lethal\nYou only have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then it's you know we ... we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\nBut the presidents would be okay so there's ... you think the cherry showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lowe's Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good at they are not used to it I don't know how to do it\nNow that still terrible you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily well then what is it what's the preparation for you to have to be prepared to use deadly force\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay and I'm just doing this in the interest of time on my bed may it may sound\nSince I don't mean that they hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presidents a visual obstruction they send the signal not come do not cross there will be constant warnings\nBut somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line it probably would push or I'm Talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got to hit that it was storm that caused the mob in rain storm\nTerry just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm and gotten you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strength or we just have to\n... even if there is a casualty or to the dry eyes have their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd they're still peril yeah\nOkay so the alternative is still a lot of men\nNo no I have to hold a lot it and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to take one for the political legalized asleep it's unfortunate but this is what they this is what they take it all by taking there's just\nYour own okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that that this is um I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio rain again you're going to the network\nRene rushes long five Ninety\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's ...\nHome advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area in the handle any kind of project you can read reviews from check their email ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is at home in mines are completely free to you\nGo home at ... dot com or download the ... to get started [noise]\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage your well\nOur investment advice is about to you it's about providing your kids with opportunities for a head start in life viewing secure and your retirement in ... in your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you the path to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your new steeple financial advisor ... that's S C I F E L people make wasn't company incorporated member S.

Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of census last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to

imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved with any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because it'll like Trump's manners because they think Trump has goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's no line to hold off\nOn this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding an end to the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home

were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when suddenly said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point

pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything if has got to be in tents everything has\nBlown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on I'm Hillary

goods on how Trump's Foley election my chipping in colluding with the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Muller is not going to deliver your key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with the like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but they're there and look to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up\nBase\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been\nThey've bought it\nThey drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump gee even with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this folks\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released within this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated\nRural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise I mean it's it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections\nI thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies in the drive by media rather\nThan break the rules and released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don rollers wrapped it up my mother\nIs gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking it up before the midterms\nIn hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's throw the election is imminent that is what they're hoping\nThey're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed out there\nThe ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here\nIs\nWill create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that port handles disaster for Trump they'll ...\nAnd ... each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms wouldn't\nBlow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this\nIs going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic peaks lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is\nVery serious take them very seriously don't tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth\nBut you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and\nAnd and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that\nThat that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's\nIt's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people to think about this series is it makes no one's about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched\nThis I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen really honest this is one of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\n\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally\nOn affected by life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling it it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he'd one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ...\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would

get a blue tie we need these women to when they're wearing says I'm confident not over confident\nYou asked me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats how would target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so what what did she do differently she's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that\nAt the White House today Trump would not say whether the FBI is involved in the investigation Turkish officials believe to show he was killed by a Saudi hit squad but the Saudis deny any involvement secretary of state Mike Pompeo visited Saudi

back to the phones we go I I'm I'm not through making the point is blue wave stuff but there's a lot of like here\nIs that CNBC poll do not expect a big democratic wave this fall I got three stories that are out here plus Don of Brazil about\nThis now I don't want to make too much of it but that's the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence or maybe they are just purposely dialing back\nFor Strategic reasons and I still think there is going to be what I I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able to discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegades that'll bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this but\nWe'll get back to this I Need to get back to the phones first Canton, Mississippi\nIn a Damien nice to have you welcome to the ... network\nThank you Mr lumbar I appreciate it this is definitely a bucket list item for me\nWhen I'm flattered I appreciate that very much\nUm so I had a a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the terms and not not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh\nI don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the flight the Democrats' chances and you know boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term\nWell uh I that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worth\nThere is in in the\nIn the quote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and vaunted department of justice that nothing they do should impact elections\nI mean call me even cited this\nAs reasons for doing some of the things that he did it\nOut I Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact\nOpposite forget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this it may even be a written regulations for all I Know\nBut it I I I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentleman late procedure that the D. O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales that justice are blind the department of justice does nothing including indictments that would impact and election now\nThe Hillary cases do they had ... heard their futures dependent on it their careers dependent on it and she was a Democrat nominee they're not going to be in the business\nOf charging and pursuing indicting the Democratic nominee again ... the unwritten regulations not impacting the election so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in Mahler report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to leak that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is eminent let me get that headline again just to\n\nNot have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know this is going to drive the left literally ...\n... ... ... they're not going to be able to restrain themselves how long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is\nHow long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian ...\nJake Tapper start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we not insured affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds of that are pretty good or not what about you play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump hate mongers on Mueller's team if they had the gods yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nOh my God presidents doesn't next you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called paragon virtue on the left we're wandering perversion has become normal in their world and they demand that we accept wanting perversion as normal they sit there and act like\nIf you called women Austin but we're not talking a woman we're talking about a dual ... a porn star double crossing\nBack\nStabbing woman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer she's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call it a name she is a woman who attempted to run with him\nBut for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like\nPeople don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on\nPeople talk this way this is what resent what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply looked at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom your Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people\nI mean they're they're comedy has become literally hate\nAnd then they act like one of the greatest social trends question your history of humanity is occurring when Donald Trump uses the term horse\nFace when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ...\nFeet in the truth about her allegations I just I just find it to just a little bit hollow as though take your pick ticket that take your pick any left wing or on media\nGriping about Trump's using the word Horst base and ask yourself if that media reporter\nNever talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity the presidency\n[noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they can try\nAll day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters Mike Shanahan fact that there's so much good going on here focused on that don't don't need to distract everybody with that stuff\nBut you do\nThere are also going to they're not going to give

she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump there was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because

cause which was getting rid of ...\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence\nPlaces people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer immediate not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap\nAnd reports over and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo mock or he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate or he simply reminded everybody unreal world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point\nIn the outcome of those hearings make no mistake once Trump\nDid that and cause the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford vanished jihad no evidence there was nothing to support\n\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to do you believe her yeah the basis of what well it does happen but if she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said that were there and say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point in cabinet came in and of course his his re testimony is re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\n\nThe story was that the

and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around the drive by Israel they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause lab even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit\n\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn or your who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to what news story that's a drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was thrown Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay is legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here ... the prostitute porn star is paying

Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep\nDescribing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more ... low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to him\nAnother poll quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved\nFor the job he was doing and that was after the failed pork you it was it was after the signing of Obamacare and after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nApproval from only five percent of Republicans\nAnd I

what\nHas it been confirmed if something happened since this program ... has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia has it been confirmed not confirmed so it will likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out\nAnd then they listen to music while

has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable graphics that they were using to try to make that case\nBut I think there's

this\n\nWait a minute it was a five hundred square foot plates at two front doors ... ... ...\n\nI've ever Google employees going back and they had their own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than needing it for claustrophobia and the the as the like being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years well anyway\nEverybody has a home with a front door and a lock on most people have one front door for some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door and every window is what's important\nTo feel safe inside\nNow how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was it was fairly expensive\nAnd then simply save home security came along offering a solution to protect all of your doors and windows in the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using state of the art technology and the systems they make\nThey use ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the H.

now being referred to as a lovable little teddy bear\nType guy in the New York times\nThere is now I Know I went through this the other day but I Am continuing to see this is what makes me suspicious of this story folks you know I read my tech blog news I read everything there are still\nPeople attempting\nVia they're reporting to suggest that there\nWas a recording of the murder of ...\nFrom his apple watch my friends this\nIs item number one that aroused my suspicion about this there's even a tech blog ...\nOut there called apple insider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this inserting on Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying\nAny relation any any complicity in this story so\nWhoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during it were recorded by showing these apple watch and are now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name has been misappropriated\nAnd has been falsely accused of\nReporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly here's why the the apple watch angle this doesn't work\nI Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is L. T. E. or cellular signals two years ago\nWhen apple and well actually fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watch they activated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you could do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operated what you do get emails and messages and their record your workout data and so forth if you could receive a self like we didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that the the watch\nFailed to me are doing just ceased to be a slave to the phone\nThe other two ways or blow to and why fight\nAre the three ways that day they can get to watch in data can leave a watch\nYou take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and\nThere there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in a car in the parking lot at the consulate there is only one way that\nWatch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to his weight by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max you get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against other nations\nBeing able to monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protections that an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's ... that couldn't happen so he only had a way it would be why\n\nThat would only work if the wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered\n\nAnd the wife I connection on watch\nJust because the phone connects the wife by when the phone does the watch automatically comebacks but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fight network because the phone it's parents who uses it\nThen like if you're at home you're ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs\nYou'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range if you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that when he was probably know to do it\nUm I don't know that they would give them the password how what do you get the password of the Saudi Saudi console don't want to find that the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud is\nJust so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this there are still\nPushing that that recording existed it somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish\n\nEncourage him to promote the kind of activity to blind shake was engaged in and bin Laden and so forth so it may be a distinction without a difference\nBut as far as the rest of the world can is concerned and the rest of Islam is concerned de emphasizing a reforming ... some it will be the same as as as telling Christians that we're going to get rid of Christ\nAnd replace him with a transgender what they just and it's been brought that to a screeching halt\nThe reforms this young friends wanted to engage in our done Fox they're done because of this\nIsn't about Trump the\nSaudis have now lost Hollywood area manual says I'm not getting any money after\nThis guy wiped out this this this teddy bear journalists Silicon Valley is running for the hills so fast you can't even see their tracks\nThis dream of a gigantic new city and Saudi Arabia built by Hollywood in Silicon valley people with all the latest tech advancements and modernization dad in its tracks\n\nSo whatever this young prince wanted to do people believed him and with this assassination of a so called journalist who's actually probably more closely tied the jihad than journalism to show the whatever the show friends wanted to do its dad\n[noise] and that's the reform of ... ... hobby is like what have been tremendous if that have happened if there had been follow through but it's all been arrested now\nThe young prince has been stopped dead in his tracks young prince is being blamed for this murder yoga France supposedly called the Fifteen hit men column in nursing white this guy out torture him nobody criticizes me\nYet there is no those who say well those are the kind of reforms he was trying to Institute get away from\nPeople thinking that the Saudi royal family would not tolerate criticism that's not who he is is what he wants people to believe but look at what people think of him now\nSo\nThe Muslim Brotherhood and they don't want any part of Saudi Arabia lining with the United states against\nYou run they don't like the Saudis in the United states ally in with Israel's nobody in the in the in the Islamic world likes is Muslim Brotherhood doesn't want any westernization off any part of the Islamic world much less Saudi Arabia\n\nAir to one runs turkey Muslim Brotherhood I mean this is who ever did books this has been whatever else it is\nThis your friends has been stopped dead in his tracks with this\nAnd the two for I think somehow trying to link Trump to it and blame him because Trump will not immediately walk away from the Saudis Trump will not dump on um trouble not canceled oil deals arms deals\nAnd because of that they're trying to say well you know Trump doesn't care if a guy died oh Trump ... about his arms money in oil and relationship with other rich guys and that's what they're trying to say about Trump because he and pump AOL will not immediately\nSigned on to the still unproven details of the death\nOf ... I just wanted to make sure that\nThis part of the story was given some some time because there's a lot\nMore to this there's always more than anything that Dr biased try to present something simple and open and shut easy to understand top Hollywood professor I'm Sorry top Hollywood publicist on base how or rock\nI haven't seen Los Angeles this excited about liberal politician in years\nUm\nDid Hollywood relocate to Texas or does is Beto O'Rourke running for the Senate in Texas in Hollywood\nIs somebody explained to me\nWhat in the world a yard sign or a series of them from Beto O'Rourke are doing on well obviously fund raising but nobody in Hollywood can vote for the guy\nTop Hollywood publicist I haven't seen LA this excited about a liberal politician in years at not gonna sit well with Obama is not gonna sit well with Hillary\nUh CNN is doing a town hall when back to their genetic count down six or five hours from now I town hall when Beto O'Rourke\nMay hate Ted Cruz they hate Ted Cruz like they hate Obama I'm Sorry Trump\nOr they're all in trying to put that's how you look at last time this has anybody remember the name Wendy Davis\nYou don't remember when did it Wendy Davis was ... she was the ... own rocker per day this is only what two election cycles ago\nShe was this Texas politician so called came out of nowhere and was this really a pro choice anti conservative anti Bush anti she was perfection she was lying snake\nBut she was portrayed in the Dr buys as the second female coming that was going to continue to wipe out conservatives and she was getting\nGrows and grows and grows of Hollywood money and she was\nGoing to wipe out her opponent in the race for Senate and she got shut locked she got shot in a landslide a humiliating last and she swing\nTheir way out there may have been reborn is Alexandra okay seal called tests for all I Know and now this is being repeated Beto O'Rourke\nYou and this guy can't this guy say my mother has been a lifelong Republican and another one of his mother hasn't been a Republican in twenty five years\nHis mother has voted Democrat in the last Fifteen elections\nI think I Can't tell the truth about very much at all then you go to Missouri Claire McCaskill Claire McCaskill got caught are oh buddy James O'Keefe all a hidden cameras a project berets to us\nAnd they get into the McCaskill campaign they get McCaskill campaign people admitting that Claire would take everybody's guns away yesterday if she could she take away their magazines she do everything she could but that they can't\nSay so because they wouldn't get elected if they did and then all these cameras capture McCaskill saying pretty much the same thing\n[noise] [noise] yeah I Can't say that I wouldn't win re election if I told the truth about ... these are not her words I'm paraphrasing but she admits that she doesn't tell the truth about her intense\nOn the second amendment and on guns because she wouldn't get elected and she was also overheard say hang on secret hidden video that she would gladly gladly give up some votes from the boot heel of Missouri in exchange for winning being in St Louis\nOh she's so mad about this now by the way\nThose videos the O'Keefe videos the drive by media in St Louis was ignoring St Louis television stations were not showing the video so nobody knew about it other than those of us here\nIn real American media\nBut ABC CBS NBC for example nationwide and none of the St Louis do these stations were showing or even talking about\nThe video so what is clear doom she called her buddies attention to it\nShe should've just shut up she sure Senate nothing but no you know what she did she went out and she accused her opponent\nOr being involved in this trick Josh Hawley the Republican candidate and\nThen she demanded some kind of investigation special counsel or something to find out how this guy was engaging an illegal political tactics and when he had nothing to do with it\nJosh Hawley have nothing to do with what O'Keefe project very tops were doing but McCaskill is come along and his demanded that there'll be a an investigation or or some something happens to to holiday because of this\nThis has forced media outlets in St Louis to play the video so they understand what it is she's talking about so she succeeded\n\nIn getting the video playing on the St Louis TV you remember it was Claire McCaskill is was um could this be six years amendment uh twelve years ago\nRemember the ... one of the previous Claire McCaskill campaign the big issue in that campaign was stem cell research and she ran an ad\nRecorded by Michael J.

white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown since two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this gross\nWhite liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters while a substantial\nPercentage of Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing it anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute into those are the level of white working class was totally go to hell and all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party I mean the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high for Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rates that they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nInfectious Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some

always concern is that Trump's outrageousness\nNo longer fuels anger on the left as it should just people just got used to it\nUp the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing the Democrats have to get their people to the polls\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a river bay for so long and just people don't gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republicans like maybe the headline is true that Republicans fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\nThere may be an isolated case of a\nSuburban woman thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut this election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted\nFor Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important\nI just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean in a few votes\nHere it may\nIt may have caused other Republican candidates to you know lose maybe hold elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand that because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics and they assume this is it dad zipped Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video than it\nThis

don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for this somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking thing that they've got to be using facilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who\nThinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on a track there's got to be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang if people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe start invite Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the if that's the game plan\nBut I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats things that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp Lennie head back to the phones got time to work so I'm In here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nBut afternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the Hannity interviewed I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you didn't do that in just a second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kym who's always told me to call you I should call you a call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up from South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them since they're not immunized\nAnd if you've been law reform reports recently yeah the new diseases out called will not a new disease is a disease out this has an outfit called ... and it's a polio like oh yeah it's disabling and also killing ...
