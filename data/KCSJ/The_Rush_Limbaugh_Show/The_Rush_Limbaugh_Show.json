said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have the Mayor Bill Clinton was very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you but um there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's\nAbout something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're

dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that and all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of

grew up\nI mean it's hard time I grew up with ... and maybe it's because I I mainly grow up and military synagogue my dad was in the air force but there was never politics never came current events did but not politics\nLet me ask you this is it's not like me ask you this ... in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in your appearance that opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they but they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't couldn't I said that they were I mean because what I'm going to\nSay that yes because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're really they're willing to claim the victim had but nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nWell the one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThe ... it it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there's there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and do quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti that religion is not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's it is a religion in time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from the religion I don't think you can and it's you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal\nYou're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes out now with the disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel's doing that yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a book 'cause if they're inside the religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] but um yeah but I I don't\nI used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheism and you see that they're anti Christian too um I don't see them as necessarily\nBeing assuming Islam but I mean you know but I Do the it's a it's anti God\nThat's exactly right I was wearing Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes image judgmental isn't right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else it bears no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's X. men one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I just I'm so how this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say but you are\nThere's all the liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's any Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it\nSo this has been in Pittsburgh than it does it add to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't and I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there are targeting\nA Jews in a way that they would want to go she'd have to think about I think that this is these are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nUm I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous\nAnd it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything silly like that\nGlad you because I'll tell you\nThere's a lot of people that think and they're predominant bite thank you thank you so much Rachel I purchased racial ... Thousand Oaks California [noise] um\n[noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do a lot of people think it's\nGoing to dampen a turnout what you you would think I'm wrong or you\n\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by Senate Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nWell there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in ... fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump\nI have I have an\nEntirely different which is why I did the show opened today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nEnd of the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it has this happens to these two events come along and they I this is that this has to be what it is their thinking\nAnd they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking the president\nWhat he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible\nAnd what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how it's Washington the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be\nPunished is where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern government as an agent of power\nTo enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes place a Web says\nWhat's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponent Congress writes the laws but the idea that Washington should be able to\nPost I Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American\nViewers are looking at in terms of murder\nI don't want to add a lot of the reason I was a murder\nYou know here's what I said ... yeah he is responsible\nFor fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out oh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for a ... looking at him as a murder we didn't say that no we didn't see that Matthew Dowd but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that led to emerge\n[laughter]\nNo they are so they they when when they're when they're confronted with what

small part\nIt's kind of amazing or a last question I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repair this relationship where do you see him going forward just doing exactly

thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere ... what do you see them doing going forward\nAnd if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if they walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing hauling the press is not going to happen and

result of the shooting incident\nIn the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the caravan that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let and it's the wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid germs at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen\nCan't pin it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever know whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in place\nActive on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurts\n\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump with their stories earlier this year about how he\nSeparated families the border and how Trump didn't like the narrative and didn't want it but last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans at look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one the issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right where would they would be mightily disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles I also\nThink if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell [noise] I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human the fate [noise]\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border may cause they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those are very real limited that's over for three months\nAnd the objective is to show up\nRight as the polls open on mid term election day\nSo if they had been walking\nFor what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of course a ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox News in the a P report that a second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already crossed into Guatemala\nThey're hoping to catch up to the main group\nAs the massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing to join the main group which reportedly and swelled its ranks with several people who've already been ... or did the caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on the more again Monday morning departing the southern may cause city of tapping Chula the smaller group trailing entered walked a mile away from Honduras late Sunday according to the aid pay\nSome in the second the caravan are said to have experience in getting across\nThe border with includes a number of deportations have some of whom have been sent home multiple times\nEight twenty nine year old the inner Anthony ... is reportedly was deported for the six time from the U.S five months ago said they catch you and you're trying to get back he has a son and a U.S citizen girlfriend living in Birmingham, Alabama according to the Washington Post\nJust like that which occurs every day and has been at the southern border for many many decades I mean it's it's an invasion that has so far\nLead to a minimum twelve million illegal aliens of the country and these incessant calls for amnesty for all of them\nBut let's see what happens when they are supposedly a week out let's see if the organizers\nOf this thing began to deny the members food and water\nLet's see if the people behind this creating a humanitarian crisis one week before the Irish jeweler rival\nOh my God\nLook what's happening it's in the middle of the Mexican does or doesn't they've gotten out of water and there's no for my we've got to do something we got to do something\n\nThere is a hurricane coming that Mike oh well it's a perfect storm that couldn't be\nComing to fruition here this is the ultimate\nOctober surprise that we're still trying to figure out who's behind this here's let me go from Texas He was on today with the Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us\nWhat you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way to the border\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats and Democrat name Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents ten Nineteen sixteen after ... gangs came across\nThe border New Mexico and killed a bunch of people not only did he four Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's I'm going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs me stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to remember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim\nAnd Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the the way I talk to the Louis he'll talk about Jeffrey is talking to Jeff and I don't even know who these types of who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions Jeff Sessions or big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points\nThey already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country and if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary mover is behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises its eventual waiting but I think this is the left behind it\nFor a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review and we're back great to have your Rush Limbaugh kicking off a brand new weak and broadcast excellence here an eight hundred to eight to ... to eight eight to [noise]\nOne more of an Louie Gohmert he is from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill cameras says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply conservative violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of and by the way the the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night\nIs it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nWho right mind would want this who when their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they've they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nOne of the world is so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration\nOf how soft this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the\nElderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest they're being driven solely by emotion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a masked a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and saint of the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't been here for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nCom\nFormulate your [noise] dominant gets to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah a lot of people worked up\nAbout that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nAh there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence from up by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because of positive comments out for\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections [laughter] what if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do\nStand aside for seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms\nOf it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because\nOf the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized has the border if they bomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address\nPut everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean I think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is about the people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can't try to deal with this on his own he needs to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on\nTape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends and we will continue as we always\nHave to get them off\nTo Russian by be Mitt and work\nOn the radio on to win\nDot com [noise]\nMy friends I enjoy things that are well made take cigars for example the details are what matter a proper assembly properly rolling the cigar is central for a good draw the

still volumes pickles catch most or many of us we see coated [noise]\n\n\nWell we have some interesting calls way and then you hear a false in a couple up there a couple of callers really really\nWorried about this after Trump's not going to be able to stop this and that the military\nIsn't trained for this and we have some people on the phones or think this could go south\nPretty fast and wreck and ruin everything we'll tackle this\nAnd much much more when we get back after an obscene profits time out ...\nYears ago making a murderer became less the TV show then a force of nature and veto uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice and\nIt was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan gassy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to overeat budding emerge\nMounting a murderer is now in the ... radio as to when the fog\nOnline at ... dot com and on your phone with our ... radio lab\n[noise]\nHeartbreak in Pittsburgh I'm Joe ... in the morning has begun in Pittsburgh after eleven\nTo know what's good for you which is how the left looks at the body politic in general it is how the left it's how Obama it's how Hillary Clinton deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton can says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past him kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to\nPromise to do this that and the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are elected properly in Tampa David they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support it but able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to their Jim Acosta\nIn Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside just roaring\nAnd cheering and having the best time they've had in a week or longer and he can't stand it\nAfter all his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you keep falling for the lives and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gotten so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore\nBut what is troubling as to what behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now is as to who believes and he does it I think because it still works instill rile people up that divides us horribly yeah\nOh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes is\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump has been working is spend like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers hey resent the hell out of Trump Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you\nAre which takes me to one piece that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to a David go lurk near brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science but we have cited his work countless times on this\nProgram over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the ... way\nBack when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate ...\n\nAnd let me give you some quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating\nIn for a reason most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming\nAmerica's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased\nPrint says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist\nFor future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten and this is so\nRight on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has none left\nAs this or go larger says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain\nDestruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again\nFor now though the ... only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America\nThe implications here are important and they're painful\n\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America it does folks\nNothing every leftist hates America but the leftists either no right to alert and her at all they do hate Trump\nThey hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectuals they hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all he doesn't have any ... except getting the job done\nHis goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself\nInvents and uses I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate\nHis certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many people\nAre just not right and everybody has their you you just don't wait too you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am\nI Know your full of it fine no you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this and you'd be doing the right thing they can't stand\nThat they love equip vacation they love people see the both sides of the things they he reaching\nOut with the heart they hate certain movie especially when it conflicts with their\nOwn now back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities guidelines women\nDoesn't see the need to apologize for it\nSometimes he's treated women disgraceful aid for which Americans left in Ryder ashamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but Gartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America\nI'm Sorry about the ...\nOf ... constrained average American Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself a losing sleep over it\nThe difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with him\nWhether they love are merely tolerating comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer the factory hand the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife\nLeftist intellectuals I Know say they dislike such people in so far as they tend to be conservative Republicans\nDonald Trump was elected president by a significant electoral college margin\nThey can't win these elections that they've been hoping and praying to win ever since all these special elections now the midterms coming up we'll get another lying to themselves about the future are going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do with it they're going to investigate Trump\nNancy Pelosi can't help herself she's bragging talking about the subpoena power is that really what the American people want they want Donald Trump and the people that work for him brought up under investigation for two years instead of real life on the ground improving the way it is\nIs this what the Democrats in media really think it's just what they're left wing candidates really believe\nThat the American people are so filled\nWith a range Donald Trump and his administration they want all of them investigated they want all of them put in jail they want the truth to come out the Trump cheated against Hillary with\nRussia they're still obsessed with this stuff they're obsessed with the fact that this election was they're stolen\nFrom them and now it's time to make it All right\nAnd they are convinced you what Trump investigated to aunt there just to be tied to heaven persuade you to join them so now you're part of the problem\nAnd so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation that consists of a majority of angry deranged\nLunatics in order to get what\nThey the media and the Democrats want that's what they're trying\nTo create right in front of our eyes radio ... practically an inspirational post I Want to\nPossess the character that that is non green weeds are you guys thought he might be that ninth grade we southern again try our new nine green wheat sounds to me John sweet yeah freak yeah it's\nDifficult to find a person in America right now whose life has not been impacted by the opioid epidemic in fact a recent report found that enough off the lights were prescribe in two

okay so I'm not against or the ... at once again I sincerely appreciate everybody holding on we're going to start in a viable Ohio David Europe first that I hire\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening to\nNPR and Steve as a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the hardest jobs in the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mom they use what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's not when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nThat there's you know thousands of people on the line went on they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so ah your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you wonder what the enemies doing or what they're up to that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can\nThat uniform we've got a bad we got a a a a bad a connection here uh about the only time I read or sitting NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said oh for the audience and\nAnd that happens when I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA ... but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\n\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and a ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day as I Believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings they give you just have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know and so me screw with Trump Trump's Hitler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge ...\nRamos or whatever it is it is what does he tell among do ... what what what is in ... Illinois but what does it Univision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob\nWhere packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks\n[laughter] they don't look like they're kind of people you'd want to run into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's ... he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want us a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and let them in the all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are the peak of humanity these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this much which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nIn these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye of the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats booked asked about the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\n\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats on immigration as a loser for\nThem\nMemo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win all never gracious vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most draconian of Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border\nAnd threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has

starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard up but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like that where they didn't want it to last and so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gamut is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not\nGoing to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right where they would be my only disappointing particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody\nHas to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two\nThousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states since ... Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTwo thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and it'd be one of them start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think but I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams of what would the environmental wackos thinking about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the ... in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human PC\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to get her I just hit the southern border may go they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many miles\nA day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next\nDay that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen\nVideo of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand\n[noise] and\nThen of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox News ... ... S P report to the second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and\nHas already crossed into Guatemala they're hoping to catch up to the main group\nAs the massive migrant caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing\nTo join the main group which reportedly and swelled the ranks with several people who've already been deported the caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on the move again Monday morning departing the southern may cause city of ...

this morning bill hemorrhage says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence pond pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when we have a\nParty a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this un wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe\nHave somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging at a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest are being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help the benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having them may I ask a bunch of experiences there\nIs no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever we may as well not have any\nBorder if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just a race to the border and say to the world come\nOn it because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning anything\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to hurt gene point advantage

attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer out\nWe're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned about this ... saying that we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because a positive comments out is look\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what window Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou didn't you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized just a border that if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and\nPut everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bringing back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean I think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else's but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is it a whole lot\nOf different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get off\nTo Russia by be Mitt work rain\nRussians

play\nIn the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're individual you're sort of very good at it\nThat wouldn't be enough okay what about this what about the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and what\nWas the end of the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you know you and your like you you don't use bullet you use a ... one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force not lethal\nYou only have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then it's you know we ... we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\nBut the presidents would be okay so there's ... you think the cherry showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lowe's Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good at they are not used to it I don't know how to do it\nNow that still terrible you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily well then what is it what's the preparation for you to have to be prepared to use deadly force\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay and I'm just doing this in the interest of time on my bed may it may sound\nSince I don't mean that they hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presidents a visual obstruction they send the signal not come do not cross there will be constant warnings\nBut somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line it probably would push or I'm Talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got to hit that it was storm that caused the mob in rain storm\nTerry just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm and gotten you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strength or we just have to\n... even if there is a casualty or to the dry eyes have their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd they're still peril yeah\nOkay so the alternative is still a lot of men\nNo no I have to hold a lot it and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to take one for the political legalized asleep it's unfortunate but this is what they this is what they take it all by taking there's just\nYour own okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that that this is um I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio rain again you're going to the network\nRene rushes long five Ninety\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's ...\nHome advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area in the handle any kind of project you can read reviews from check their email ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is at home in mines are completely free to you\nGo home at ... dot com or download the ... to get started [noise]\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage your well\nOur investment advice is about to you it's about providing your kids with opportunities for a head start in life viewing secure and your retirement in ... in your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you the path to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your new steeple financial advisor ... that's S C I F E L people make wasn't company incorporated member S.

Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of census last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to

imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved with any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because it'll like Trump's manners because they think Trump has goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's no line to hold off\nOn this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding an end to the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home

goods on how Trump's Foley election my chipping in colluding with the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Muller is not going to deliver your key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with the like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but they're there and look to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up\nBase\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been\nThey've bought it\nThey drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump gee even with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this folks\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released within this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated\nRural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise I mean it's it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections\nI thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies in the drive by media rather\nThan break the rules and released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don rollers wrapped it up my mother\nIs gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking it up before the midterms\nIn hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's throw the election is imminent that is what they're hoping\nThey're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed out there\nThe ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here\nIs\nWill create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that port handles disaster for Trump they'll ...\nAnd ... each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms wouldn't\nBlow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this\nIs going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic peaks lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is\nVery serious take them very seriously don't tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth\nBut you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and\nAnd and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that\nThat that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's\nIt's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people to think about this series is it makes no one's about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched\nThis I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen really honest this is one of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\n\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally\nOn affected by life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling it it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he'd one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ...\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would

get a blue tie we need these women to when they're wearing says I'm confident not over confident\nYou asked me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats how would target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so what what did she do differently she's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that\nAt the White House today Trump would not say whether the FBI is involved in the investigation Turkish officials believe to show he was killed by a Saudi hit squad but the Saudis deny any involvement secretary of state Mike Pompeo visited Saudi

back to the phones we go I I'm I'm not through making the point is blue wave stuff but there's a lot of like here\nIs that CNBC poll do not expect a big democratic wave this fall I got three stories that are out here plus Don of Brazil about\nThis now I don't want to make too much of it but that's the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence or maybe they are just purposely dialing back\nFor Strategic reasons and I still think there is going to be what I I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able to discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegades that'll bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this but\nWe'll get back to this I Need to get back to the phones first Canton, Mississippi\nIn a Damien nice to have you welcome to the ... network\nThank you Mr lumbar I appreciate it this is definitely a bucket list item for me\nWhen I'm flattered I appreciate that very much\nUm so I had a a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the terms and not not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh\nI don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the flight the Democrats' chances and you know boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term\nWell uh I that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worth\nThere is in in the\nIn the quote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and vaunted department of justice that nothing they do should impact elections\nI mean call me even cited this\nAs reasons for doing some of the things that he did it\nOut I Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact\nOpposite forget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this it may even be a written regulations for all I Know\nBut it I I I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentleman late procedure that the D. O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales that justice are blind the department of justice does nothing including indictments that would impact and election now\nThe Hillary cases do they had ... heard their futures dependent on it their careers dependent on it and she was a Democrat nominee they're not going to be in the business\nOf charging and pursuing indicting the Democratic nominee again ... the unwritten regulations not impacting the election so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in Mahler report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to leak that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is eminent let me get that headline again just to\n\nNot have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know this is going to drive the left literally ...\n... ... ... they're not going to be able to restrain themselves how long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is\nHow long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian ...\nJake Tapper start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we not insured affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds of that are pretty good or not what about you play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump hate mongers on Mueller's team if they had the gods yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nOh my God presidents doesn't next you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called paragon virtue on the left we're wandering perversion has become normal in their world and they demand that we accept wanting perversion as normal they sit there and act like\nIf you called women Austin but we're not talking a woman we're talking about a dual ... a porn star double crossing\nBack\nStabbing woman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer she's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call it a name she is a woman who attempted to run with him\nBut for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like\nPeople don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on\nPeople talk this way this is what resent what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply looked at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom your Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people\nI mean they're they're comedy has become literally hate\nAnd then they act like one of the greatest social trends question your history of humanity is occurring when Donald Trump uses the term horse\nFace when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ...\nFeet in the truth about her allegations I just I just find it to just a little bit hollow as though take your pick ticket that take your pick any left wing or on media\nGriping about Trump's using the word Horst base and ask yourself if that media reporter\nNever talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity the presidency\n[noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they can try\nAll day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters Mike Shanahan fact that there's so much good going on here focused on that don't don't need to distract everybody with that stuff\nBut you do\nThere are also going to they're not going to give

she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump there was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because

cause which was getting rid of ...\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence\nPlaces people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer immediate not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap\nAnd reports over and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo mock or he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate or he simply reminded everybody unreal world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point\nIn the outcome of those hearings make no mistake once Trump\nDid that and cause the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford vanished jihad no evidence there was nothing to support\n\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to do you believe her yeah the basis of what well it does happen but if she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said that were there and say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point in cabinet came in and of course his his re testimony is re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\n\nThe story was that the

and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around the drive by Israel they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause lab even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit\n\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn or your who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to what news story that's a drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was thrown Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay is legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here ... the prostitute porn star is paying

Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep\nDescribing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more ... low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to him\nAnother poll quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved\nFor the job he was doing and that was after the failed pork you it was it was after the signing of Obamacare and after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nApproval from only five percent of Republicans\nAnd I

what\nHas it been confirmed if something happened since this program ... has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia has it been confirmed not confirmed so it will likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out\nAnd then they listen to music while

has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable graphics that they were using to try to make that case\nBut I think there's

this\n\nWait a minute it was a five hundred square foot plates at two front doors ... ... ...\n\nI've ever Google employees going back and they had their own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than needing it for claustrophobia and the the as the like being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years well anyway\nEverybody has a home with a front door and a lock on most people have one front door for some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door and every window is what's important\nTo feel safe inside\nNow how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was it was fairly expensive\nAnd then simply save home security came along offering a solution to protect all of your doors and windows in the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using state of the art technology and the systems they make\nThey use ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the H.

now being referred to as a lovable little teddy bear\nType guy in the New York times\nThere is now I Know I went through this the other day but I Am continuing to see this is what makes me suspicious of this story folks you know I read my tech blog news I read everything there are still\nPeople attempting\nVia they're reporting to suggest that there\nWas a recording of the murder of ...\nFrom his apple watch my friends this\nIs item number one that aroused my suspicion about this there's even a tech blog ...\nOut there called apple insider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this inserting on Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying\nAny relation any any complicity in this story so\nWhoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during it were recorded by showing these apple watch and are now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name has been misappropriated\nAnd has been falsely accused of\nReporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly here's why the the apple watch angle this doesn't work\nI Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is L. T. E. or cellular signals two years ago\nWhen apple and well actually fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watch they activated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you could do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operated what you do get emails and messages and their record your workout data and so forth if you could receive a self like we didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that the the watch\nFailed to me are doing just ceased to be a slave to the phone\nThe other two ways or blow to and why fight\nAre the three ways that day they can get to watch in data can leave a watch\nYou take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and\nThere there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in a car in the parking lot at the consulate there is only one way that\nWatch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to his weight by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max you get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against other nations\nBeing able to monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protections that an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's ... that couldn't happen so he only had a way it would be why\n\nThat would only work if the wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered\n\nAnd the wife I connection on watch\nJust because the phone connects the wife by when the phone does the watch automatically comebacks but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fight network because the phone it's parents who uses it\nThen like if you're at home you're ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs\nYou'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range if you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that when he was probably know to do it\nUm I don't know that they would give them the password how what do you get the password of the Saudi Saudi console don't want to find that the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud is\nJust so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this there are still\nPushing that that recording existed it somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish\n\nEncourage him to promote the kind of activity to blind shake was engaged in and bin Laden and so forth so it may be a distinction without a difference\nBut as far as the rest of the world can is concerned and the rest of Islam is concerned de emphasizing a reforming ... some it will be the same as as as telling Christians that we're going to get rid of Christ\nAnd replace him with a transgender what they just and it's been brought that to a screeching halt\nThe reforms this young friends wanted to engage in our done Fox they're done because of this\nIsn't about Trump the\nSaudis have now lost Hollywood area manual says I'm not getting any money after\nThis guy wiped out this this this teddy bear journalists Silicon Valley is running for the hills so fast you can't even see their tracks\nThis dream of a gigantic new city and Saudi Arabia built by Hollywood in Silicon valley people with all the latest tech advancements and modernization dad in its tracks\n\nSo whatever this young prince wanted to do people believed him and with this assassination of a so called journalist who's actually probably more closely tied the jihad than journalism to show the whatever the show friends wanted to do its dad\n[noise] and that's the reform of ... ... hobby is like what have been tremendous if that have happened if there had been follow through but it's all been arrested now\nThe young prince has been stopped dead in his tracks young prince is being blamed for this murder yoga France supposedly called the Fifteen hit men column in nursing white this guy out torture him nobody criticizes me\nYet there is no those who say well those are the kind of reforms he was trying to Institute get away from\nPeople thinking that the Saudi royal family would not tolerate criticism that's not who he is is what he wants people to believe but look at what people think of him now\nSo\nThe Muslim Brotherhood and they don't want any part of Saudi Arabia lining with the United states against\nYou run they don't like the Saudis in the United states ally in with Israel's nobody in the in the in the Islamic world likes is Muslim Brotherhood doesn't want any westernization off any part of the Islamic world much less Saudi Arabia\n\nAir to one runs turkey Muslim Brotherhood I mean this is who ever did books this has been whatever else it is\nThis your friends has been stopped dead in his tracks with this\nAnd the two for I think somehow trying to link Trump to it and blame him because Trump will not immediately walk away from the Saudis Trump will not dump on um trouble not canceled oil deals arms deals\nAnd because of that they're trying to say well you know Trump doesn't care if a guy died oh Trump ... about his arms money in oil and relationship with other rich guys and that's what they're trying to say about Trump because he and pump AOL will not immediately\nSigned on to the still unproven details of the death\nOf ... I just wanted to make sure that\nThis part of the story was given some some time because there's a lot\nMore to this there's always more than anything that Dr biased try to present something simple and open and shut easy to understand top Hollywood professor I'm Sorry top Hollywood publicist on base how or rock\nI haven't seen Los Angeles this excited about liberal politician in years\nUm\nDid Hollywood relocate to Texas or does is Beto O'Rourke running for the Senate in Texas in Hollywood\nIs somebody explained to me\nWhat in the world a yard sign or a series of them from Beto O'Rourke are doing on well obviously fund raising but nobody in Hollywood can vote for the guy\nTop Hollywood publicist I haven't seen LA this excited about a liberal politician in years at not gonna sit well with Obama is not gonna sit well with Hillary\nUh CNN is doing a town hall when back to their genetic count down six or five hours from now I town hall when Beto O'Rourke\nMay hate Ted Cruz they hate Ted Cruz like they hate Obama I'm Sorry Trump\nOr they're all in trying to put that's how you look at last time this has anybody remember the name Wendy Davis\nYou don't remember when did it Wendy Davis was ... she was the ... own rocker per day this is only what two election cycles ago\nShe was this Texas politician so called came out of nowhere and was this really a pro choice anti conservative anti Bush anti she was perfection she was lying snake\nBut she was portrayed in the Dr buys as the second female coming that was going to continue to wipe out conservatives and she was getting\nGrows and grows and grows of Hollywood money and she was\nGoing to wipe out her opponent in the race for Senate and she got shut locked she got shot in a landslide a humiliating last and she swing\nTheir way out there may have been reborn is Alexandra okay seal called tests for all I Know and now this is being repeated Beto O'Rourke\nYou and this guy can't this guy say my mother has been a lifelong Republican and another one of his mother hasn't been a Republican in twenty five years\nHis mother has voted Democrat in the last Fifteen elections\nI think I Can't tell the truth about very much at all then you go to Missouri Claire McCaskill Claire McCaskill got caught are oh buddy James O'Keefe all a hidden cameras a project berets to us\nAnd they get into the McCaskill campaign they get McCaskill campaign people admitting that Claire would take everybody's guns away yesterday if she could she take away their magazines she do everything she could but that they can't\nSay so because they wouldn't get elected if they did and then all these cameras capture McCaskill saying pretty much the same thing\n[noise] [noise] yeah I Can't say that I wouldn't win re election if I told the truth about ... these are not her words I'm paraphrasing but she admits that she doesn't tell the truth about her intense\nOn the second amendment and on guns because she wouldn't get elected and she was also overheard say hang on secret hidden video that she would gladly gladly give up some votes from the boot heel of Missouri in exchange for winning being in St Louis\nOh she's so mad about this now by the way\nThose videos the O'Keefe videos the drive by media in St Louis was ignoring St Louis television stations were not showing the video so nobody knew about it other than those of us here\nIn real American media\nBut ABC CBS NBC for example nationwide and none of the St Louis do these stations were showing or even talking about\nThe video so what is clear doom she called her buddies attention to it\nShe should've just shut up she sure Senate nothing but no you know what she did she went out and she accused her opponent\nOr being involved in this trick Josh Hawley the Republican candidate and\nThen she demanded some kind of investigation special counsel or something to find out how this guy was engaging an illegal political tactics and when he had nothing to do with it\nJosh Hawley have nothing to do with what O'Keefe project very tops were doing but McCaskill is come along and his demanded that there'll be a an investigation or or some something happens to to holiday because of this\nThis has forced media outlets in St Louis to play the video so they understand what it is she's talking about so she succeeded\n\nIn getting the video playing on the St Louis TV you remember it was Claire McCaskill is was um could this be six years amendment uh twelve years ago\nRemember the ... one of the previous Claire McCaskill campaign the big issue in that campaign was stem cell research and she ran an ad\nRecorded by Michael J.

white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown since two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this gross\nWhite liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters while a substantial\nPercentage of Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing it anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute into those are the level of white working class was totally go to hell and all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party I mean the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high for Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rates that they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nInfectious Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some

always concern is that Trump's outrageousness\nNo longer fuels anger on the left as it should just people just got used to it\nUp the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing the Democrats have to get their people to the polls\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a river bay for so long and just people don't gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republicans like maybe the headline is true that Republicans fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\nThere may be an isolated case of a\nSuburban woman thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut this election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted\nFor Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important\nI just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean in a few votes\nHere it may\nIt may have caused other Republican candidates to you know lose maybe hold elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand that because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics and they assume this is it dad zipped Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video than it\nThis

don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for this somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking thing that they've got to be using facilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who\nThinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on a track there's got to be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang if people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe start invite Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the if that's the game plan\nBut I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats things that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp Lennie head back to the phones got time to work so I'm In here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nBut afternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the Hannity interviewed I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you didn't do that in just a second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kym who's always told me to call you I should call you a call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up from South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them since they're not immunized\nAnd if you've been law reform reports recently yeah the new diseases out called will not a new disease is a disease out this has an outfit called ... and it's a polio like oh yeah it's disabling and also killing ...

somehow feel the need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it\nAs some sort of new definition of humility a rather than having used as a teachable moment there's something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making their country great we want every country putting their country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point\nFor everybody to do better but not by piggy bank in the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're ... they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nA don't don't

very controversial when it was ratified in the uh in the early in the mid Nineteen nineties\nBut in terms of being a subject of cable news announcer going to do it two or three panels tonight on NAFTA trade deal and not going to have a lot of people tune in\nIt's just the way of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden today but people get it is important in terms of its important as an election issue it's crucial\nIt is um I wouldn't say crucial but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me\nI told you I was going to do this I told you it could be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion in the subject the world trade don't doubt me and in that sense\nIt's a confidence

rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal the NIH and finds that uh what is it with Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how one world did Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it was we're\nMade to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet don't woman they have written the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public so people were trying to\nClaim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a note ringer\n[laughter] it's so unfair it starts button light and it\nBecame obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nSo some senators began to say that it could well be\nSenator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and I was all the other possibilities were mentioned\nShe eventually asked for point of order the German Grassley and and ... a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this out ... re just allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff if any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter] but what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't her what she said 'cause it's off Mike but\nShe's obviously asking them did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you did you look at ... she turns back to the camera we didn't make it this is a German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say oh is this how we're going to determine who leaked something she gets to turn to her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it\nAnd Dianne Feinstein guess will turn around and ask her staff hey did you read this letter and nice loan nor nor was it was with us she turns back around so we we didn't do it with German as though case closed it wasn't us they had to have done it it was strategic\nJust like what happened on friday was statistic\nStrategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday of a transcript of a conference call\nThat a Kurd last week among and between

report\nI helped expose crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not perfect partially because now movie opens October twelfth amazing\nCormac God's know is perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history\nBring friends and family you do not want to pass a unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about abortion got rated PG Thirteen foreign [noise]\n\n\nFor example who would have predicted back in July or August that we'd be done with NAFTA we'd have a brand new trade deal\nThat gets rid of the horrible aspects of NAFTA and have a trade deal it's pro American and then after that how many people think that that is instrumental in voter turnout\nSaturday October six what's new today on the free our radio a radio\nKnow the question was like oh no Harry the polls are tightening home I got you know well what what does that tell you what ... what\nWhat what what's going on\nHere we are so many races that are within the margin of error\nMissouri Nevada Tennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have the best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls are often wonder about Republican wave in the Senate in the house in the ... not in the house\nRepublican wave in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump ... an impeachment of the Democrats get the house don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake\nClones in there because they would never vote to ah to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks so the panicked host Jim surely couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\nHe says there was discussion of a blue wave big generic battled advantage for Democrats do you notice the tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans on you know there's a lot of talk all with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republican but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening of the house races\nI'm an only get a little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya\nEastern very ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the Democrats had a twelve\nPoint advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's what all the talk of the Democrats winning back Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I but I Know of one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and several of them will fund we're going to watch a horse race you had videotape of a horse race that nobody at sea and it was not a big race is not allow the players to make friends leave bats and weighing Drew's on who was going to win\n\nSo the players made their batch and that'll ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me it was going to win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds\nHave the final turn ... stops the tape of the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win yet look what you want to do it you were making bets uber guessing some of your probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime third quarter finish doing your job\nSame thing here posing January in front of the ... election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh news\nSo how relevant could've been answered none village is zero not up and so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking racist or\nType thing in my house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had this in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the cabinet of lay out now all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nRed wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about final current and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't want anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen I Am the reason he saying this\nAnd everybody else because of my viral production of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything\nThat production of mine went viral a drive by is loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible\nThat's when they run the sound bites me predicting in all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them\nThey run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite he's just the exact\nOpposite why all of this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that they live on just said they were gonna lose\nThey are totally totally confused and as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win you know people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really fight 'em up that'll fire buddy up no the way\nYou can get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning\nThe capital nomination now let's go to for news at ... some of this from the hill dot com red state Democrats

what they have just just like\nThe mother investigation of murder investigation was designed to depress Trump's approval numbers on the Trump would have to resign because of total loss of support\nIn Washington by Republicans that they can get his approval numbers now do the twenties 'cause they succeeded make everybody think Trump cheated with the Russians and Trump would lose all support as Nixon did in the Watergate era and have to resign that was the objective\nBecause there's no way they were going to impeach Trump to know where the Mueller investigation is going to lead the Trump being indicted they only hope they had was to drive public approval for Trump way down the twenties and be done with him\nWhat they're trying to do here is force Kavanaugh to resign from\nThe

should have been asked last Thursday\nBy Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but\nThey weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge her she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played right along and without had ritual Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was\nA all Trump is doing is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and

reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and

we've done the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years\nI have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it that's what the\n... this this uh ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and that of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick ... ... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether\nShe's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching as it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incidents have happened to them it's the same thing I think\nWith black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white ... every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the rage and the angered never ends it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so\nShe said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all

policy\nPriority that we're going to reduce medicated role but nobody is sad that it's just happened and it has happened\nAt the same time as a booming economy is happening it just it just more evidence I think these are the kinds of things that\nIn some cases of people around the country either consciously aware of maybe subconsciously aware of what these\nBits of evidence of a roaring\nThere there's a reason for Republican enthusiasm there's a reason why Republicans are out voting Democrats an early voting there's a reason for all of this upsetting the apple cart that's going on there's a reason why conventional wisdom is taking it on the\nChin again that'd be stuffed at this point and the reason is resolved the reason is reality\nAnd it's a um\nIt's a great thing to do the audio soundbites as promised this was on the Fox news channel America newsroom good a bill hammer\nAnd Sandra Smith were hosting a round table out there was that there was a three women\nWe had Republican National committee spokesperson Kaylee ... a\nBustle dot com head of research Jessica tar love I I refer to her affectionately as Natasha on a top and Washington Free beacon a senior writer at Liz Harrington they're talking about the Patrick ... the package bombs these\nThese a mail order devices that have not exploded yet\nAnd bill hammer starts off I go into came back in any case I mean what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what do you see\nWhat I've observed a president who exhibiting leadership he condemned the attack he called for unity and then you had a response from the liberal media today ... the president's nation instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president\nDidn't leadership yesterday called for the country to come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time for family planning prize that shameful I Will add that the New York times today tell us to publish an article tend to put the fascination of the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from the thigh convene delivered and how painful of New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece\nBy a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun does that go off and so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian\nAssassin his gun sincere use mine the times runs this story and they excuses by saying well we must publishing stories that relate to react to live with the mother investigation of Trump and from what they've got to deal with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about\nCivility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying under Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump needs to change it Donald Trump the\nMeanwhile they can call him a Nazi they can call him a Hitler or they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now isn't the Tonight Show on a top response I\nThink that the president controls himself emphatic I'd laugh at it has rally that he was poking fun\nAt the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to his audience you know what I'm thinking and and this morning he tweeted that it was CNN his fault which basically is it came to a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing a short skirt has been completely\n... saying that Santa Ana was responsible for that to get the\nFake news that they're spreading this is one fall but the arranged maniac that offending does\nBut I Hope of all let me just add a van and that's what they want to be on the record of metal pipe bomb showed up and not culpable\nFor the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth CNN you had an anchor on that network endorsed the play in Central Park depicting the assassination and the president\nSaying that the leader right now you heard Natasha on a top there say you really you you want to be on the record saying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump\nBlaming CNN as they can shoot because they got about neighbor she is like blaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um the conversation continues you're now you're here to senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... than a thousand things for years he recently commended that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy of the people have to pay the legal for anyone who got him some a lot about the\nLast what about the language of outlet and\nTime than trying to cut hair\nBrennan and CNN had a choice yesterday you saw the president come out saying is abhorrent white America to stand for black man if I Want to see an end to chat with can blame this on the president can blame it on Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move at Fort Worth it for that fight have kept the low road President Trump put the highlights what Clinton said last week we cannot have the ability\nRight we cannot have a village to be [noise] so what your hands are you in on a top actually trying to blame all all of this on Trump\nAnd of course using this I'm from the high road\nAnd I'm I'm from ah I I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears Herbert just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase it and he is\nBeing interviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nDeal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal now they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go alive Phil Donahue yes it is all the time Phil Donahue and hosts the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accidents have his birth you know\nI was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look the difference it made for me it if they started at stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo want to other people in the world as bold being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with this\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAh and condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around on the belief that it's good and decent but they're way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we\nOught to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt and he\nSays I'm you know ... they're marching north it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nThis department is responding to the suspicious packages that have been sent to several political

his project was not a bomb or an explosive device it turned out to be not nearly as technologically advanced as its height\nRight Obama I knew the Obama invited clock boy into the White House\nAnd made a big deal out of his achievements and and so forth so the patient will will for the obvious question is if that guy could have perpetrated if a fourteen year old kid could have perpetrated a

Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crock pot and viewers is going to take action except the theory is\nCrock pot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempted violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening people\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and and there's not there's never any condemnation of ... you never hear CNN can damning any of this kind of\nBehavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj is just what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd spout the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people's the inter find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots of us and our issues they have lied about them misstated the miss characterize them they have attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\n\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump would do that to anybody else comes down to the Trump\nA lot of people say but Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and hide judgment over everybody else while\nExempting themselves\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is turning perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it they're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act\nAnd then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this van I mean if you if you wanted to decorate\nTo justice and\nI I I think before the day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits and commentators on a drive by media over the edge driven over the edge by Trump doing it for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity you might you might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there is going to be a panel on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox and he called Trump a\nTotal front calling for unity when he is responsible for all of the chaos and\nDivision they will say that Trump was on believable a brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit they'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it\nRemember the ... the room the Limbaugh the room was the process by which were rock Obama\nActually got to pretend and portraying himself as on involves getting any policy

[noise]\nNot just to clarify the Limbaugh fear of them was how I explained that the media never held Obama accountable for anything that was going wrong including his own policies and Obama\nWould never even always position himself as an outsider a up against powerful interests that were standing in his way and it was valiantly fighting them meanwhile it was his policies that were growing up\nAnd I marveled at this and how how the relationship between Obama and the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable\nAnd all those lives about Obamacare you keep your doctor keep your plan twenty five hundred dollar per premium decrease every year that kind of thing never called him on it well here's Trump out there and he's a ... law enforcement\nAnd they're going to call him a total fraud here by trying to say he's free unity when he's that guy they're going to say is responsible for it is not a man\nAnd they'll say that he is bracing just unbelievably brazen for talking about business if he's not complicit in it\nThat he's trying to stand above it gave Obama the benefit of the doubt on everything but they are going to hold Trump to mark my words [noise]

S. A.\nWe didn't uh let's see there'll be yesterday that the presidential approval rating has hit forty seven percent his highest yet I don't need a despite the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN\nPoll and it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen\nBuck forty seven percent in whatever poll with is is Trump's highest and also forty seven percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating you have a twenty ten ... terms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\nThis historically a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago\nIt seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president mid term but how many seats the Republicans win in the two thousand ten mid term some of the the three\nThe Republicans one six\nThe three now in those terms conventional wisdom one out conventional wisdom is the party out of power makes big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but kirks point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and therefore we uh we could be looking here at the and a bit of an upset\nThere's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find this it is yes your ego barely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum\nWas leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron this Santas pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half\nSo statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading\nBy the way that it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum had some regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated for\nA we had the news that he had he paid an under\nCover ...\nThe money to buy Hamilton tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails and tax raise questions on ... trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Curry could help him network with power for developers businessmen and lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there is a Politico story today actually saw it last night that Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThat Donald Trump fear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win\nEverything and so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political stir and that's the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThere are other news stories that suggest drugs drugs has links to them that are the socialists of America appear ready to win and dominate and convert America after long\nLast too committed socialist policies so you find these stories all over the place about the intention of voters this uh this cycle\nAnd how they're faring the Charlie Cook report the vaunted inside the beltway\nAnalysts\nWho take a look at every election inside out with the election just eleven days away now it seems that the overall Senate playing field won't change much although what appears that some of the races in toss up are getting even tighter\nThat says\nIt's getting more difficult to see a path to the majority for Democrats with Democrat US Senator Heidi Heitkamp heading for defeat in North Dakota\nDemocrats now need a net gain of three seats to win the majority the one way would be the whole the five Democrats seats and toss up and pick up three of the four Republican seats in toss up\nIf you will read the book report I'm not going to bother telling you which ones those are but that's how they analyze the bottom lines of this story is that New Jersey has been moved to toss up\n\nIn the cook report New Jersey has been moved to toss New Jersey ought to be deadlock Democrat any day of the year that you look at it\nNew Jersey being in in toss up\nAnd Florida remains a coin toss although Democrats see a path to victory for US Senator Bill Nelson well they better he the incumbent he would have the\nPath to victory in Montana between Jon Tester\nThe incumbent in state auditor Matt Rosendale that racist tightened tester maintains an advantage that's either just within or just outside the margin of error there is an addition to the top ... column is the race in New Jersey moves to toss up from lean Democrat\nNow all of this movement taking place this week in the midst of the bomb scare\nOn the Republican side Republican district teachers feel better about us senator Dean Heller is where he is in in Las Vegas strip teachers also feel better about Martha ... Sally where she is in her race against the\nWell gifted in cinema I'm gonna with withhold the characterization Tennessee in Texas remain unlikely candidates for the tossup column so looking bad for Beto O'Rourke there\nBut the um\nSays there's a great difference of opinion even among Republicans where the race in Texas between crews and or Rourke stands today cruise allies contend that\nHe's way ahead of O'Rourke well outside the margin of error but the cook report people say we are aware of other polling\nThat shows a closer race back to Florida for a moment thirty eight Florida sheriffs are demanding Andrew Gillum withdraw his anti\nCop pledge thirty eight elected\nFlorida sheriff's on Thursday called on Andrew Gillum the gubernatorial candidate here for the Democrats to immediately and all that quickly withdrawn he'll support\nFlorida residents save our say I've junior is the suspect arrested this morning and plantation Florida a white van reportedly covered with tributes to President Trump has been driven away to be inspected NBC reporter Pete Williams says we'll learn more soon\nWe'll hear more about it and details about it this afternoon at two thirty from attorney general Jeff Sessions and other authorities in New York who were involved are so actively in in this investigation\nTo suspicious packages were discovered today one was addressed to former national intelligence director James Clapper at CNN studios in New York Clapper tell CNN\nSaid anyone who has been a critic of a public was acquitted of was\nA nice to be on the bachelor the judge and caution cautious of which were supposed to live\nThe other package was founded a mailing center in ...

exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today and you add that\nTo what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that\nThe the deep state not ... the Democrat Party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years\nOn this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous what has been done in these\nPast two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why did the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned it in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign and you never met Trump he never gave him any advice\nBut he was hired early on because the media was how many dropper or your advisors who's obviously spills out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name stuff and help her\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph Smith Seward who planted in his mind the idea he drugs do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that stepping up was twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador\nIs stepping options you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told him well they planted it in his head he didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point that investigations go get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state\nWants their government back we don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to\nWe can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it gets theirs\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother but this whole two years ... who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever finds out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had the wit and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion without well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do and I know it is true I'm not I have no doubts about it

him and explaining\nThe divide that exists in the country specifically by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up against\nA to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about\nThis country surviving as founded we're under a solved it has never been worse\nAnd they made the civil war but but those were different circumstances a that was a specific argument\nAbout cultural things regarding slavery that any and nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude can ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept of America as mountains\nSome people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and I I I've uh just sort of evolved here into a\nPosition where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning ... and it may be present some\nAre solutions but they have to I have to be very careful I don't overdo do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are so that's coming up as the program on falls back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off\nApologizing to the nation\nApologizing the cabin all on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him and the Kavanaugh episode codified is exactly what I think we're up against\nAnd it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling with people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments offered the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limit on how low they will go on how get braved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean getting back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born or and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't know it\nSo the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this and I bought [noise]\nBut they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate\nAnd not even worthy discussion or acknowledgment\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence Kavanaugh was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says buddies believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck

a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\n\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were sneezing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it

couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows\nSeriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but\nThey're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy

shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control\nThis is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true some I'm not asking for

[noise]\nI say well it's a person and great as an American I'm worried [noise]\nAnd it's actually for the same reason part partly why I Am so great is because with no offense to anyone I have the most fabulous grandchildren in the entire world [noise] for a lot of times I Do\nShe's already said that they get that's Hillary Clinton using coral Gables Florida and she just showing up at the microphone and during outbreak she said\nI'm paraphrasing because I didn't hear the whole thing but she was going on and on a lot about is horrible terrible\nBut we've got to come together we got to get together\nAnd she said the way to do that is still won't let candidate that can bring us together\nAnd of course that means Democrats\nSo here be ... by the way the bomb that was sent to the Clintons and Obama never got\nTo their homes just F why\nWe still condemning them don't misunderstand\nThe bombs were intercepted by the postal service at one of the distribution centers so they were discovered very quick into bomb that was sent to CNN didn't even get sent to the right place\nIn terms of where people work at CNN and it was addressed to John Brennan a who doesn't even work at CNN he was over at at a at MSNBC so a\nHillary Clinton right on schedule is now out reacting to this [noise] putting on his face of bravery and courage she is willing to be subjected to attacks like this because America is worth that kind of things\nAnd that you got to make sure they got out there and vote for the right candidates are going to bring this to a screeching halt arms Mrs Clinton\nIt's your party forgive me that is encouraging this kind of thing it is the Democrat Party that's home to all of these mobs it's the Democratic party Mrs Clinton herself\nWho said that being on civil at this point in time is entirely proper and understandable it's at the time to go back to the village he will be after the Democrats when\nYou've got bought and paid for operatives by Mrs Clinton money showing up at\nTrump rallies trying to make them look like deranged Trump supporters the Democrats are even paying people\nTo ... to do to address wash flick is on American flags and waving them around\nMade to look like a drill ranged lunatic Trump supporters and so in the midst of this\nAtmosphere we have this series of bombs that were supposedly sent today explosively to Democrats\nAnd it just there's a smell test that this stuff has to pass and\nSo far a lot of people's noses are in the air not quite certain what to make this\nUh this is just it's it's it's not it's not Republicans that show up for example at the offices of the family or what what is it a pro life groups offices\nSome guy shows up on with a gun and it was going to shoot people got caught before he was able to shoot at family Family Research center I think yeah Republicans just don't do this kind of thing even though every event like\nMass shootings remember every mass shooting there is a Democrats in the media tried to make everybody think right off the bat that some Tea Party or\nDid it or some talk radio fan dated or some Fox News viewer did it turns out it's never ever the case not one of these bombs went off\nAnd if a democratic operatives purpose here is to make it look like hey you know there are mobs everywhere to the moms are not just Democrats mobs I mean look at this you got people here trying to trying to harm CNN and Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton and Debbie ... show and\nYou know it just it it it might serve a purpose here\nBy the way I guess what's also not in the news now and that's the that's the other mob that's finding its way north through may call attempting to crash the U.S border at or near election day that story is off and I'll tell you there's another story that's not being covered right down that is the declining blue wave\nThat was supposedly automatic and going to happen a week ago and a month ago but we're not going to let this side track us\nWe are not going to be distracted there's only so much you can say about this incident until we have more information\nAbout speculating would\nBe fun but since we can damage all bombs here at the ... network we don't want to go too far down this road I Do know that people want to weigh in it or wait in on it on the phones and we'll get some of that in right now starting in Atlanta this is Tanya and your first stop was how're you doing Hi\nHi Russ Crane can be on your show you about how about yourself a little nervous um\nWait a minute wait why why why don't I don't know why are you nervous\nI I listen every day I'm forty nine ah unless you and car fall in love your show well a waiting for my daughter she lost her book\nWell thank you so you shouldn't really nervous sure you're here every day and there should be like a you know just talking to a buddy\nI guess that's true yeah I'm I'm also married to the Gulf ... here in Atlanta so um what I wanted\nTo be married married to what a cough ... here in Atlanta a golf pro yet there\nPublic a political circumstance where they can't anger so many people are just a public service and it is a a heartfelt\nAttempt\nTo be compassionate and helpful [noise] time will go on and we've all we've all learn who it is targeting these innocent Democrats we will learn why these innocent Democrats were targeted and probably whoever did it will be\n... and we will find out who they are where they are why they did it who pay them\nOr if they were not paid by the simple fact remains Democrats in America are at risk\nTo save them to protect them vote against them\nA public service announcement from me your host Rush Limbaugh and the idea of\nThe uh the bomb here as the bombs it didn't take long for Trump to be blamed the former aides to Hillary Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise] so I guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got back from turkey after killing to show me right\nSo Trump and of course they're going to occur and kill showing and come back here and they start sending out bombs to Democrats [noise]\nAn end to Hillary Clinton Philippe Reines\nSaid Mr Trump this is on this guy ranges is [noise] I mean [noise] the elevator doesn't go to the top floor like to say is an order of fries short of a Happy Meal\n\nWhy would someone smart enough to make a functioning mail bombs actually believe they would be open to buy the Clinton or Obama or George Soros\nAnd ... and and so close to an election what kind of food do something like this\n\nIf a smart bomb maker [laughter] if somebody really really good at making bombs hates the left this much\nDoes he think this is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise]\nUm I actually think in all ... what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn that I think I'll just put it this\nWay if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything blow up on your your watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports and at\nRestaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing\nThat really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system with so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do other words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt just brandy hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment that's all they've got\nAnd so if none of that work if all of that backfired and ball leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do\nYou might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side\nYou might want to do something to make it look likely insane lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters perceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis them in terms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle\nSite real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place\nWas on ah the Fox Business Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here\nAnd Tom ... all the polling data that they have it real clear politics\nAnd analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up tend to forty one the seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats plenty of out of that sort of two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races the G O P can hold the house\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving and Democrats favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\n\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n\n[noise] and Trump is a great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired historian and political analyst sends an email\nEver new it's a cycle and you can print\nNews radio I'm deem you to a suspicious package sent to CNN studios in New York City was reportedly address to former CIA director John Brennan renting ran the CIA during the Obama administration earlier this year President Trump revoked Brennan security clearance\nBrennan has been highly critical of Trump's actions\nThe discovery of the suspicious packages CNN prompted the evacuation of the time Warner center that followed news that the secret service intercepted suspicious packages mailed to former President Obama and former first lady Hillary Clinton all three packages have been identified as potential explosive devices\nThe White House is reacting Sarah Sanders noted that a full scale criminal investigation is underway\nFor from Sarah Huckabee Sanders condemning this and the strongest pops a language saying that they condemn the attempted violent attacks made against President Obama President Clinton's Secretary Clinton and other\nPublic figures and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law the United states Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and we'll take appropriate action\nTo protect anyone threatened\nBy these characters quite a strong statement but it's clear from this morning that I hear the White House during a crisis mode they're trying to stay in front of this story and uh they're letting everyone know the president has been briefed\nTons Nichols reporting a Miami building that houses the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is being evacuated doo doo suspicious package sent by mail\nThe return address on the suspicious packages found\n'em at the Clinton Obama insurance residences or the return address belongs to be in the official Debbie Wasserman Schultz obviously the return address to say there is no suggestion obviously that the congresswoman sent these packages right now her for the office has been evacuated his police investigating a package there\nThat's Craig Melvin reporting you're listening to the latest from NBC News radio [noise]\nShowers likely off and on throughout the day today fifty five for a high forty furloughed tonight was ... Sunday in warmer tomorrow is sixty six looks like upper sixties low seventies through the weekend [noise] loving that's the beauty of Madison read [noise]\nCan I ask you a quick question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a two thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nNo no I mean how how many are the are the Clintons an obstacle for the upcoming mid terms of the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this at Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium chore third team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and\nTalk about politics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clintons aren't anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on this phony collusion story to lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much age and so much anger the wife and I remember hearing is not sick it just it just to pet it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let time on\nThe phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia or been within that there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate\nThat you very much rush you know it's a you're\nTalking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh you know that that information out there for the masses of pain you know\nQuite being there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nDemocrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's well it ...\nAlong all along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around would it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat\nIn cocaine and a lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nBut the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like that Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously have set up as a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot walk\nIs out there trying to claim credit for this economy wasn't he wouldn't know how to create in fact the Democrats are the people that have people on their side that love bombs\nBill ...\nOne of Obama's buddies and in fact but I'm not saying there is any connection do not misunderstand me\nBut the other Sondra bocce is right on the\nMoney here Here's Mark in Orlando or as I guess in Orlando in Florida right to have you here with us mark ...\nMake it did U.S Russia a\nTruly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and\nAnd you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the health of east um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary enemy of domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kinda thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already plan to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good piece and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush he taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no ah are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made off and so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody was open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like in conspiracy\nTheorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense and I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them as soon as I say this was a philosophy that I have a stone for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that these are all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to what other then they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons\nDesperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle in working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the what was it iron my shirt\nUsed to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd that it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us and she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator but\nI\nI have for everything you've done to my family I Can't help but I find you the most compelling most interesting guy\nThat I haven't run across I wanted to meet you for I don't know

wants to parlay his positions of power into positive influential goodies for himself\nHe's a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals entitlement to perks and ah and other things things willingly a desirous of seeking them\nAnd it's um [noise]\nIn in this in this era where everybody feels the need to denounce the special interest and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday\nShowed that Andrew Gillum is ahead of just ... to to forty six among the light ... voters\nAnd he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence and it's the third such poll in about a week ten days to show Gillum with this clear to lead as his overall edge in public

their\nBeing Daewoo used their entire families are being threatened\nTheir grandchildren are being threatened their wives or their husbands bar made everybody they know being threatened it's enormous ... is never ending the phones\nDon't stop bringing a threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving in is on the ... it is vile and it is evil and it's not just like\nAn columns and mansion it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins\nI think they have to be\nCredited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous pressures\nFlake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only members of the pain\nProfessional mob squad on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for Kavanaugh in us it's not technically a vote for Kavanaugh to vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threat to these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted there still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this was his final term\nOr the easy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and received the praise of the mob and receive the praise of the Democrats and he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked vicious wave\nHe is going to be a cost and by the left all the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow\nThe same thing with Susan Collins a senator from\nMaine I Can't describe for you you might\nHave an idea you're probably know the things that are being sent to these people the rats that they are getting\n\nBeing alive and notion that we live in a civilized society it's unhinged much of it\nIs is insane and

same phrases all over them\n\nAnd these people I don't know if you've ever received threats and I don't know if you've been ... by them\nBut if you have an if you believe them they can honor view\nAnd yet flake and Collins did the right thing here I only hope that they're able to maintain their positions not Collins has announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\n\nAnd of course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be\nNow they're thinking on this goes that that there is no way she wouldn't vote yes on the procedural vote this morning\nIf for intention is to vote no down the road if you're going to kill the nomination do it now not tomorrow I don't think any of these theories or traditions can be hoisted up\nAnd used in ... and I think we're in we're in a brand new territory here for a number of reasons\nI don't think you can say that just because Susan Collins and voted yes this morning means a guarantee she's going to vote yes tomorrow and then why make a statement at three o'clock why why make some ... why three o'clock and why make some statement I Try to keep my\nShe'll announced her decision on whether she'll again vote

percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism\nSocialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism in communism attempt to her race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend on anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo socialist in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennials men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets that the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity dangerous\nMasculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want\nTheir power around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons at tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book is famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant\nAnd it just the nature of things and so\nThey're being highly highly successful and targeting America and its founding\nNot just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited\nMost\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communism socialist so I have an evidence\nBase here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up a guy\nPublished yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title [noise]\nIt is a horrible peace and it does exactly that which I had been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding of America the trash white men that\nReminds me hang on here you need a grab an audio soundbite here it's a bit of that but I Do but it would you be every bit of six and seven [noise]\n[noise] ... quote\nKavanaugh has no avenue of appeal do except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\nAnother ... code\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary if combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime\nWith the intrinsic American ideal of white male privilege he used a sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long ... he blah burned like a newborn as plot ... his career you see\nHe hasn't had a series of goals in a gym for them all know that guy is a dangerous schemer he has plot and they get on the Supreme Court where he can rule\nSome of the force of on the yacht and became the ultimate purpose of this country society if a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis\nThis is what this clown saw in the Kavanaugh hearings but you know the reference as a single phrase my Thomas Jefferson the public life is about life liberty pursuit of happiness the fulfillment of the white American man's desires\nAssumed the force of the meeting and automatic\nAnd became the ultimate purpose of this country society if a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis bingo these people prove me ride each and every time I go analyzing them\nSo the trouble with America is it it was established by white men for white man and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd life and liberty was only intended for white man and if any white man was instructed in the pursuit then there was something wrong with America\nDo not minimize this I'm telling you this belief is animating the last two generations informing the last two generations of kids going to high school and college this is the kind of dribble that they are being taught\nThat America is corrupt from its founding days that it was founded for an exclusive group of people white man nobody else need apply\n\nAnd when they don't get their way in other words when minorities start taking over\nWhat she knows lesbians and gays transgender you name it when those people start taking over that's justice\nWhen white men have their lungs handed to them and have to listen to what their pursuit of happiness has meant for everybody else misery death destruction discriminate this is what they want you people believe\n[noise] go to the audio soundbites [noise] more documentation last night CNN Tonight with Don Lemon\nTalking about the protests against the capital nomination and your love of the host me\nThere is a not at all subtle under current to all of this this is not just an attack on conservative it's an attack on white men Rush Limbaugh come on down\nThese women are angry something has happened to them in their lives and their rage and anger they take it out now on the country are on all men or men in the powerful majority what you're white Christian man and so forth [noise]\nHe said it so don't get mad at me and say oh no limit everything's about race rather than searching for the truth the president and his party there are appealing to their base people who feel\nFeel victimized who fear the world is passing them by feel\nPeople who see all of this is a zero sum game if women\nOr people of color or ... people advance it must be at someone else's expense\nNo no no ... and that's what people are doing I'm merely chronicling what's happening out\nThere it is on the ... I just shared with you one of the countless examples like inside this guy Michael list uh\nIn the New Yorker suggesting that Kavanaugh's crying because he's a white man targeted singled out for advancement in America by other white men and when it's not going his way breaks down and cries\nThis piece justifies the attack on white men it says it's about time\nThe whole country and the assault on the whole country is validated because it's actually an assault on a white male majority which has caused tyranny and sadness and misery and death and destruction for everybody else\n[noise] oh I said was\nWomen are angry me too movement women are angry something's happened to them their range an anger they take out now in the country the majority of which white\nChristian man that's the targeting you can't deny that white Christian matter just white men period are the target of modern\nFeminism of modern American liberalism and the American left somehow Don Lemon converge this into a racial\nIssue it is a race we're talking about the structure of America as founded and wants to become of it and the justification elapsed sees for getting rid of England France warming\n\nYou know you you what Trump allude in any way to women's time of the month on all hell is going to break loose\nBut here misery even get to talk about on his lowest common and every day and everybody gets everybody understands it\nAnd everybody knows what it means it means to stay away leave it alone don't engage yes ma'am yes ma'am three bucks or whatever and go on\nShe did this\nBy alleging that Republican male senators are acting like the ... mentioned does Senator Grassley\nThe chairman of the Judiciary Committee he has um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen the turtle is adamant\nThis week the turtle and ... have been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer remind US Senator Feinstein and in this whether he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e M Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations us shortly what producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr Ford's allegations I don't know what other inference we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence\nThat the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even though balls e Ford admitting\nThat she took a lie detector\nWell her warriors did and that she had seen the therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed the legislature we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your reviewers old but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nAs a reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details to her therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must be it\nYou must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy notes the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the officers and Feinstein Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried W Ramirez Julie sweating the representative what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his what\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching her whatever\nI mean he loaded for bear this is the kind of college in general the violation and I\nShouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphones infant disease on it or are they the\nMedia people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member things are coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to confirm judge Kevin ... before that\nWas during his ah southern for remarks today in favor capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right\nThe leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nFit to be tied now I think I have some might relate to it I got an email last night from Salinas Ito\nWho has made a name for herself by traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't save and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be set of Republican political consultant they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a note from\nLast night and she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant\nAnd what has happened out there\nIn these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together now a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six saying that they did so for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand sixteen that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the capital circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things\nSome restrictions apply for a complete details as much actually dot com\nCheck out Russia slot at five tiny KPSK dot com the word

not confirmed the court stays up for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four and then the case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing\nChanges and that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking courts that could make decisions\nRegarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit

face Feinstein looks like she is\nWell the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand that she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\n\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those would be watching under dental camp do you see\nThe pain the expression on the face of

we're going to deny because he committed perjury and I'm going to deny him because he threw ice in a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made a plan that he doesn't think\nKavanaugh shouldn't be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action but wasn't one of the world are we going to be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they

now in the midst of this political campaigns on a two thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nNo no I mean how are the are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming mid terms of the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar\nExcept they are today I mean the Clintons announced yet this at Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium chore\nThird team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about politics what what if there isn't a whole\nLot of interest in that [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets I don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clintons art anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state and Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now at Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger their wife or their marriage is not sick it just it just to pet it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what in form\n... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is a we'll see we'll let time on the

uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting\nThese bombs in the mail you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be owned by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information out there for the masses of pain you\nKnow there were never any attacked or these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered the Democrats they've proven time and time again there's simply\nNo load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and like video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh\nNothing has worked what makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it\nThat way it doesn't make any sense\nFor a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around would it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way they thought\nDo not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not\nGoing the way they have a short us but the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like that Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this

air is fascinating is they're really really really a fascinating he's one of those guys too is you know really walk through the fire for his principles and um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump down from South problem\nNot just days of reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a ... if you will\nBe really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I mentioned I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but there's a certain the New York times to visit the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric Holder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go\nA low I say hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for 'em when we when that's when civility concert again um there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take them behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there in the new democratic\n... what's the difference between that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that's ... ... ... what they're saying they are trying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're certainly not selling themselves at the new Donald Trump's ... they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm do I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out and said the holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized drained but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service just civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to let a lot of\nTimes what made them almost unbeatable was for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat just as hard nose they at least\nTried to hide it\nThis switch is now overt we're harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said this now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic part\nAnd it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X. they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the that was his Vail mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd it ... that they would have followed Malcolm X\nThings might have been worse for Denver for a for blacks for a while\nYou back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no 'cause you know animals harassing innocent people in the restaurant and that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\nYou know the all right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking\nIs either they're horrible horrible and the people in a totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people are like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but Steve Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal human instinct\nAnd that's not even Nazis that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews in blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I mean there was an actual death in Charlottesville right hey and everyone would say that that is horrific um but you know there was all over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there were ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was arrested this weekend the I think it was CBS that was reporting this he was arrested because he had built a two hundred pound bomb and was going to blow himself up on election day they didn't even report that he was a leftist\n[laughter] they just won't recognize it ah and\nYou know who on the left standing up\nWho's standing up and go we don't want to be you know that's not us we don't want to be a part of that they just denied that it

they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know oh that climate change man made climate change is a hoax are somehow responsible for people having lost everything and floating risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham\nHe's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a tropic hurricane because they elected climate deniers here's the headline in an article written\nBy this guy was published in the guardian on some obscure little rag or a penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what are we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the logic and the reasoning that he is teaching these engineering school the guy is still range this is this is hyper political part is disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name\nIs Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricanes ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity and the global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting republic comes into office\n\nYou wonder that a state like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio on the his argument is that in the last Republican image deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction others op so this\nClown who is disguised as a as an engineering professor

left engage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or ... or it's\nThe Democrats blue wave is drying up oh that's not to be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth team mid terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party and the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling questions this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely it's filled Democrat and it's in line with attorney tend to Republican members around now\nYet yet and we\nPointed out that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic wave would if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asked well how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows the Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could it generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people among three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote\nWithout a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning\nThe majority in the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole ... every other state that they have they held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's\nLet me go state by state to show her this is all happening and ... the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this is a\nTraditional gear party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities or running in certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought\nOf and categorized as something other than what it is\n\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trial very much there have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like ed ... hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty\nDifferent articles so that trend has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it\nMade me in movie equals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made then how do you get a distributed and how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they persisted and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of karma guys now it's it's it's a it's a\nProcedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating a PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any abhorrent\nGore and violence in the movie it's it's ... picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform\nNot the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen\nBe pro life producing a movie about something that really happened\nMass murderer he was a mass murderer of people in the womb that nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so when I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself\nTo murder the

had supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and and others in\nThe Saudi royal family because of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul and hasn't been seen since\nWouldn't it be great if this is one of these they just lost her mind and Washington over the cabinet and stuff and then there was this\nHudson Valley New York guy arrested after allegedly planning to blow himself up on the Washington Mall around election day because he's upset about the country's direction now do you think this guy is going to vote for\nThis guy is obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and find that this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring people to vote for them because of the great improvements that will happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise] right here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want revenge not a job not raise non a bonus they want rooms range in age eight Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise]\nI don't believe that the country is that the arranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is okay to the phones men in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rush thanks for having me on Yes sir I so\nI was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week\nI saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was this is all they have the reason that they continue to reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan if it's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to do so they just keep doing the same ... and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed\nEverything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they really hit of desperation if they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing a new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right lose it when we're silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters will certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYep threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs that we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does it they can discourage jumping up and up and they could not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans and conservatives stand up\nWhen every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities really engagement you saw that was\nI was right in the middle of it I Would live streaming the whole time um I went right up to Linda so sour in and told I look at their out there

phone interview a Thursday morning with facts and friends presidents and it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington and he just trust and members of his\nTeam he cited Nikki\nHaley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like\nAre there are so am I Am not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... this is not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to and I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry\nUh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump calling in to Fox and friends today is talking to Steve do see a doozy said you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nThat really had very little lead other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some\nWe had thousands of people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected by it we added on a great control I don't think really\nThey go to very hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up that expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do when it dead and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nSo the next question from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we kick him and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nTo be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's going to discuss things safe for them to make you a very dangerous they put older [noise] what is held in contempt by Congress older when after Christians he went after our\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case a holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to being told you like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans ... away or not even acknowledge or or they would say we\nStrongest terms oh we'd denounce rhetoric co authored by a attorney general holder or it was about ... but much although totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely a unilateral condemn it\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I he better be careful\nWhat he's wishing\nNow the stock market's been kind of see song has been a roller coaster ring and Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you folks\nThere are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run\nFunds who I Am convinced would willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nWorrying economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes I laughed who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe and look at our\nPolling data people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there is a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve getting a little bit too cute that's all [laughter] when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now are for\nTwo percent it was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression was the worst recovery and the history of our country and a tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise] I'm paying\nInterest at irate\nBecause of our fads and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation is worried maybe accusing the federal\nReserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried\nWhen the economy's going great my whole life I've noticed and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story why\nIs a great performing and growing economies so for rent name\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak they that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people the Fed's going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully just down the economy at the time and totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump ... know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but no data that\nWay and the\nFederal Reserve German the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftist as they are at many financial institutions and I've got a pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much\nThey are earning as a drunk so Trump calling them out on it\nHe says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the elections so they react to it and and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day rollercoaster I think\nThere's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ...\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are more kids are there are some that I Am a not at all I've always\nBecame ... she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russia and that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump on it immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama\nChristians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met a share members shared\nAll our bells and it was about more than just the money to this is a real

so he felt the need doing expanded\nTo include South America\nWhen other reason there isn't much into your DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine lineage they use junior logical trace\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church out in the Salt Lake city has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical pray organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that story\nI get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA in any of this but ...\nThe media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American\nDNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kitten with wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary\nDNA test and he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate the future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do any ... that she wouldn't show up as Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about and most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion in my my dubious a nature when it's\nIt comes to this blue wave business\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about it the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it to go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that and so the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point to we're going to take the Senate but if you look at\nThe reality of voting\nPatterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten\nDo you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama you go through the two thousand four team in terms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships are you even go to\nA local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over\nA hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to where in the in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother election where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe\nOut the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed dollar polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power\nIn terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so\nFrom two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people willing to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they could do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen\nWhat is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean the having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift make people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so\nSays the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what\nIf you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no return peasant done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not gonna see widely reported let's see if the [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey\nSoaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand eight team is this a CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million\nJobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat equals a roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that many job openings it is and employ ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees\nCan set the terms based on their level of expertise and experience or whatever it is they're applying\nFor none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would\nBe unhappy by it or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote and yet\nThere isn't a middle Lincoln bits of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six game

happening on the Republican side many of you may hate hearing it's something you'd never Trump person but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what made that happen that Democrats attempt on Capitol\nRepublican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing up probably the first standing out in his career\nIn front of us are of a stadium or arena sized crowds I guarantee you Mitch McConnell got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation dad he simply\nIs not

considered a meltdown\nWhen you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nTwenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus on us this DNA\nDid not actually use samples of Native American\nDNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\n\nShe's out there touting that it's true is she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any Indiana Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is pathetic\nI think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every ... they're saying that what Bill\nWent and

Fox News President Trump wants more information from Saudi Arabia after it released an explanation how journalists to mark his show he was killed he made the comment after hosting a political rally in Nevada\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's being one of them small one of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than the\nFuror trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not\nBut it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people\nThere obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that\nThat that that have me and their crosshairs I Believe it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that said it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes rebuilt\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they ... if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin all it's all\nAbout destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watch this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen early on is this is one of the the editor\nThe head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most despicable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life\nTo him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions\nI'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions and he's telling you it's not your job to fix\nThings it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode went to great lengths to show how this this Lees editor who has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k.\nNo no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship they not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began and the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it went with it\nAnd the president I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's quite it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's it exposes too much uh people have\nNever had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertainer to buy it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the pita file story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got us a bit of I'll just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts to\nRun it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously are not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of this press I have no idea it's it's I think it it just

the truth intent of sexual on an amendment for team because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are running the miss impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's I'm\nA ... ... it it it's we're we're dealing with\nAsk ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet right 'cause what's causing this is causing a discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July Nineteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques that it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThat weren't going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the those black coaches were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio and he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that\nIn a house reporting number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth so it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten to converse citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became

suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise]\nTo comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most\nRecent caller I lost her when she is how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I I've never seen that\nSo I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light a I got an ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what happened and that that that has been my point it's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act the media I hated\nIt was in response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file a lawsuit was trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified that these bigots\nWould refuse\nTo bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when ... when when Indiana passes along Pence who's the governor the media was outraged and they began\nTo report on this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this attitude\nAnd all things that they do wear what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big it's are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses would you bake\nA pizza when you when you make a pizza for winning and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't do it would be against the salt they zeroed in on this

them she thought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd we're racists bigots sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and\nSo gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accepted and it's this arrogance and this is the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nYou have a the synagogue shooting quality obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this is crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they\nAre the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who knows they are not by definition\nSplit numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm and on many people still\nDoes we still have a lot of people in our side still want a couch out of the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the electoral\nResults just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [noise]\nDidn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday\nBut apparently Chris ...

believe this blue wave business not thoroughly\nNot have the right pieces like this where they admit there's a twenty five to thirty percent chance they could lose everything and then Trump would win

soon as possible you have been raised nearby we have\nThousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails on this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just proves what a suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nFriends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just ... but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump doesn't seem to have any real interesting he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants to be able to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not\nConvey\nProper information about him as his only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have yours are high\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the voice of the mainstream media you should have the best stepping pond yes uh should have\nThe ... app and pop [laughter] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even used that it\nUh but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society and it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism I\nJust wanted to get your thoughts are so but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of either trending towards civility or barbarism\nOff the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what was your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word I Want not when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time their basic uh\nIssue was a labor laws and a win for what purpose\nMy point of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted in the\nModern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism in big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in honor militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be met for green\nRussia's law guide five Ninety dot\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he's diagnosed with cancer

there are Democrats doing rallies like this\nSo my point is that that not as many people are seeing them and and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this is the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will powers at all you can't miss it\nThese people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous\nAnd they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people have a great time these are people that are up ... am happy they are excited to be where they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally in your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was it was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that on for ... picture to me of these kids\nAre slowing and the

happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event\nAnd even if you do have some happy people with the Democrats sponsored have been audio doing in the last war because a Democrat on

mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in didn't end up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so

want to be on the [noise] uh\nProgram Donald Trump responded to Hillary Clinton's criticism of the Kavanaugh event is very very bad it's attacking the integrity to court\nAt Trump's then I guess that's why she lost she doesn't get it she never did Hillary said what was done last night in the White House is a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nReporter during a press availability of the oval office asked Trump about our comments what's your response to Hillary what's your response to Hillary saying what last night's swearing in was a political event\n\nOr upset I guess that's why she lost she doesn't get and she never did I knew that a long time ago Hillary never got it that's why she lost\n\nHillary also said yes it is that that the sex claims against her husband are not\nLike the Kavanaugh's confirmation because her husband faced intense investigation\nHillary has a point we have to acknowledge she has a point the allegations against her husband were substantiated they were investigated and Bill Clinton was found to\nBe guilty he was found to be guilty of all kinds of things Kavanaugh is not has not ever will not be\nThere's not a single allegation against Kavanaugh that has any evidence or corroboration but all of the allegations against Bill Clinton had been proven Hillary's right she doesn't intend to be\nBut she is right the allegations against her husband were substantiated Bill Clinton paid an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar settlement the Paula Jones\nJennifer Flowers have audio tapes of his come on to her one either Broderick told others about her rape immediately\nThere was a pattern with Bill Clinton and sexual harassment there's no such pattern with cabinet oh speaking of that did you hear about this Jane Mayer\nPart of the duo Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow writing at the New York I'm from that second story the New Yorker came out with that not even the New York times would print because they couldn't validate any of it Jane Mayer showed up\nAt what was it the Atlantic there was some kind of a\nConvention or festival or some such thing New Yorker reporter James mayor\nSuggested in an interview that she ... Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh out of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told Elle magazine and her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors and that helps to stab her she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere was a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated\nStory to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this\nThe first story that was Ron about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nObese you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from all the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story\nDidn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people something happen just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern here is that Chris Smith of Ohio your next I'm graduated high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you thank you\nWas just wondering I was concerned and mine to get

have you ever hear Rush Limbaugh doing what I was born\nInto [noise] hosting the most listen to radio talk show in the country and there's a\nLack of a reveal in the New York times tax story on Trump\n\nThe New York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where that got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left is infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened why it doesn't matter what the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\n\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with that this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do it got Trump out there they claim is mocking balding forty wasn't mocking are\nWell I I\nStand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God\nThis is only acceptable I don't know why president that he did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there and start ripping on her\nEven if it's deserve even if it's warranted last week you could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus\nI find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart\nEspecially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her whether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing\nCommittee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or otherwise orbit differences the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all he did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want he understands that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one year the New York times and it's been investigating that Trump's for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what\nOne word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess what I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hit\nIt was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia at ten for bad yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was a totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did was make up the line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat ... not so now they're on to something else\nActually a ... or something somebody said and James borrow things mostly are too young to remember\nBottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman comes Florida political environment\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people to Saudi and said don't remember\nThe Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all John's\nYou never know what you do when you got about ... what you want to come up with what you're gonna come to you going to come up with the women like New Hampshire are great\nBut it's not a Bill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring that these people in the audience to know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript an anti Kavanaugh protester was confronted I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they don't want to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her\nBest friend who says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it or best friend said she didn't remember it protester\nSo you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept a non corroborated charge to destroy them\nBut he's life if you destroy your life your son's life or your husband's wages to answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated we wiped that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words and what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor oh no no wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up\n... you know it's unfair protester I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cassie no not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protested no there is evidence look at the standard that many people are in jail for west\nSo what ... ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought just because they're really interested I'd know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happening\nThat somebody has to have much to say\nRush probably ... being met work read Russian blog five Ninety\nLaw ...

has shattered\nNow that is not marketing for word mocking would have been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played ride along and without ahead Rachel Mitchell ask personal questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious what what the purpose was\nUm all\nTrump this is reminding everybody what\nShe said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really goes wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nChristine ball the Ford now Trump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman naturally go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head and they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left the Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... the ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it\nThan moving to the right to oh he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation\nSenate Republicans having Trump has Trump has established\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how blindly insane\nIt has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows\nHe's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nIn Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so what was the horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked both before Trump didn't\nThey just simply boy she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant white at not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accused any man of anything and it's gospel\nJoined by a so called movement called me to work all women can join ... can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men\nYou know organized for the express purpose\nOf destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine organized movement the male version of me to\nWill\nRush or ... women are nor do their research we well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant plus oh but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and they've been ridiculed and made fun up in the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed\nPresident Trump's remarks about Brett Kavanaugh's accuser are being condemned by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle at a rally last night Trump mock Christine Blasey Ford she claims that the Supreme Court nominees sexually assaulted her more than Thirty years ago but doesn't remember all the details so that minority leader Chuck Schumer says joking about that is despicable\nI've been disappointed by President Trump's comments before\nBut this is a new low President Trump should apologize immediately\nRepublican senators Jeff Flake and Susan Collins said

that I was unable to put this together it's one of the\nRare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've

their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their sink is\nBecause the Democrat Party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and that of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether boys\nWant to pretend to be girl so they can go into girls' bathrooms\nAnd becomes legitimate that's sick\n... ... in in many not that Pacific

right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who've been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's\nThe same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop as a rate every black convict is in is\n\nIn every instance here points to the country as large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this the Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who was the one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply ... I did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened like they had ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record in the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea of a mock she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming he mocked Christine walls before\nAnd here it is is is that they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target up attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president should have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd man by the way they vote or do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr ... testimony and this and it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old from I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back yeah\nIt can be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them\nWho are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know we had to draw on CNN while the other like couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number can't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nGet away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned women\nStudies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McCann and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist\nBut it's entirely possible at the same time after him that the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe\nThat men don't have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my point she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um ah you're right sexual that consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine you know the hook up better right by the way here's this ... you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think every time you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move you might get notarized after the date\n[laughter] and you're listening to Rush Limbaugh ... voice on the right Tom but either way I see Mitt\nRene

C. S. G. I. D. J.\nLo and I are doing\nMy id say dot com on your phone when our our last\nNight when he appeared to mock Christine for the kids that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in high school\nIt has been since Trump was inaugurated even during the transition it's been a series of steps or efforts\nTo get rid of Donald Trump to overthrow the election results of two thousand sixteen and I think Christine balls the Ford is an\nElement of that whole movement or that whole desire the Democratic party is in on it they are as much a part of the deep state as the F. B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\n\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here to there the objective of\nThis was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life me destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christine Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying well you know this this may screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nWell ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate\nNone of blue wave in North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the\nDemocrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened the ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana and similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when wimp out\nOr that some Republican senators would win out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nOther words these three Heitkamp Donnelly market what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would cave and Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to like and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed\nIn fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven polling has been gun\nHeading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski but if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump's sand last night\n\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now since Trump's\nOn the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\n\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence\nOn public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and\nIt is the dates the varying dates the different dates of the ... event Dr ball the says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story dates column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July sixth of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and there's the apps\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists as they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\n\nSalt the charge here in China tried served a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some\nAh some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapist notes the incident is said to have occurred in the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapists notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nAnd heard a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\n\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could've been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties early eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to\nThese changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the lawyer\n\nHurt changing story leaves her short\nOn credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes at her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred in the summer of any two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that presidents should alert or your phones that are ... yeah I forgot that weren't you'll people about this to Eighteen today there's an emergency warning system test\nIt just happened to my watch started going crazy and I'm going to lead a\nTest it's just the past it's not an Amber Alert

first test of it\nAnd they tested during my show when they know a majority of Americans are going to be locked onto a device\n\nIt makes perfect sense I just deleted it from my watch I should have

I Can't read but she says that a family show\nAnd then she admitted she was emotionally shattered by the current state of affairs which just proves the theory that Democrats are mentally disturbed people who project or mental problems on to the public\nOn the politics and exactly what is happening here\nDo not underestimate that and I don't think that I'm I'm I'm being flippant or exaggeration only make a point I really do believe that we're talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics the American but there's no other way to explain\nThis now folks to show you how to range and this is I have in the stack today I have um\nTwo maybe three one night when called teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend\nThey are related to Kevin ... button they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for the for the Democrats\nAnd much of it is I mean I just saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left one of them is\nA is John Harris at Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are the wet rag party you know those pieces about this piece was about how the Democrats get their rear end handed to them every time because all the Democrats are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have no guts\nThe Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers Democrats let Republicans walk\nAll over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of war says but I don't\nKnow how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their sides a bunch of\n... but the fact that they do is fascinating to me now here's another such pace and we have said that\nThis woman once before I don't remember specifically when her name is Alexis Grinnell she has written on gender and politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets\nShe had a piece\nOn Saturday in New York Times it may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday Night the dates October sex since I don't read the paper anymore I don't know when this stuff actually shows up in the print\nEdition\nSo my guess is this thing was released Saturday Night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been in a Saturday papers well doesn't matter white women come get your people\n\nI I don't even know where women who is thoughts are this convoluted and you're going to hear\nI don't know where they come from I\nDon't know who's responsible for creating molding look I think it's gender studies\nI think it's a combination of feminism and gender studies\nThat\nLiterally corrupt young minds in fact there is a there's a there's another link the piece today\nThat describes a hoax three self described leftists\nRan on after deem\nIn a nutshell three academics self described left wing ers are doing a kind of project verite costs like ... of how left wing journals except crazy studies as long as they contained the right buzz words and support leftist doctrine\nPeople are not taught\nPeople are taught this way hatred and rage and anger has to be taught or inspired or a mobilized you don't come out of the womb that's what everybody comes out of the womb smiling and happy\nNow when the baby mix of massive itself from the diaper yeah there's anger but you get my you get my point here the natural state of a human being\nIt's not rage an anger the natural state of humanity is not that as a ... by the Democratic party got that has become the Democratic party I firmly believe and I said this Friday and even if it makes me sound naive I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\n\nThere is not a single thing in a decent unjust country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants\nA stamp\nOf approval of winning elections yet they win them within their closely contained\nBases districts and states their enclaves which is actually a very\nSmall portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts and then the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with the leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges who rule of law and there is a dirty little secret behind this\nFolks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively otherwise they cannot get their beliefs their ideas\nPast as laws in America\nThey have to rely on activists job just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or ... before no nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need activist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the point\nWhat they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey\nCannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nYou've Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be they routinely\nSoft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a Alexandria or gift you could pass who's lunacy on display in a leftist district in New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively are you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this every thing they want\nEverything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced on the country the country has been bludgeoned into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this\nIs going to lead to this giant gap in blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when big and even the Republicans think so\nA P has them Reuters has some New York times\nCNN does no matter where you go there's always gonna be a story where Republicans agree it's over the Republican is deathly afraid

do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take this story seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledged that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products no power\nCan be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed then in fact in this strategically necessary and this goes

Republican\nUh ... true true but\nMaybe I'm maybe I'm Still waiting for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior that just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get an halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that is going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely that the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my ... I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just common for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case\nDemocrats think they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think\nThat they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout\nThere is and they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people can be reading Republicans don't have a chance\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they ... I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the event hadn't happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah I when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox saying a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this is going to be so old by then actually hurt a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet I just have to chuckle\nUm\nNow I can I can see what the passage just be you cannot maintain this river passion for long nobody can\nWelded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade there's still a month ago\nThe other side they had been chomping at the bit since election night two thousand sixteen and they're only getting more\nAnd Rush Limbaugh [noise]\nI'm\nLucky I fees for green Russian lawyer five Ninety\nYour brain is an amazing thing but as you get older it naturally begins to change causing a lack of sharpness or even trouble with recall thankfully the breakthrough in privileges helps your brain\nAnd actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jelly fish in clinical trials president has been shown to improve short term memory ... healthier brain better life now available in stores everywhere things up and evaluate anybody of this product is not intended to treat you prevent any disease\nDoes your dog itch scratch stinkers shed like crazy come to dynamite for help order Ninety Days supply of dynamite pick up two bottles of liquor jobs get the third bottle free new improved liquor chops with omega six omega three vitamin E. and now it's six extra directed microbial\nEven better for the digestive tract and immune system and dogs love it try liquid shops by to get one free this is ... ... by\nAn al ...

their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brett that was his name\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine gutted artist did his cartoonish interpretation of it\nAnd the fireman is

this is a Democrat who on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described it happened\nAnd he thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward capitalism so on good\nMorning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given free rein to interview whomever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight it's just Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ms ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh perjuring yourself and that means he's not qualified what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is nasty throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative falling down drunk and now\nHe is a a liar they are flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah are they friday's fight yeah there's not too many people to talk through here FBI's got a lot of shore or we can get this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target or they can catch Kevin in anything\nUh there's one more that I Want to play and I'm looking for and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise] the question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein you know this\nThis is a leaking this letter my memory on this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the Florida ... judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter\nHolding it up or talking about it I remember I don't know if that was\nThe week but she clearly talked about it and said that she'd had it since July and she told us all about\nIt that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding

it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade from the bed we sleep in to the raise that we use when we wake up but we've neglected one of the more impulsive products and the daily routine that old worn out toothbrush I'm Simon and ... and I'm a product designed them after I learned how important brushing your teeth is to overall health I worked with a dentist to ... that sort of a toothbrush then makes brushing most simple affordable\nWe don't want you we don't want your wife we don't want your Jewish pretend daughter we don't want your joints son in law we don't want any of you here go away but\nTrump goes to the hospital where the professionals treated the wounded and it gets very very warm welcome you don't see that report it\n[noise] [noise] um\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this\n\nAnd it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you got us the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in the story but it's the same thing\nAnd people say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there isn't a soul out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what Paul and you look at I don't care what professional here talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can breaking it our way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that OK we trust the polling day though the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ... nobody knows bottom line\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good where do you know why\nI think it was was it two thousand fourteen two thousand twelve was one of those\nTwo elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that seat won the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he is intolerable\nSince that won election where he was infallible he hasn't come close doesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned in Nate Silver distaste Santa when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pets can now say packet us in the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll all he does his analyze them\nHe's never participated in a poke either the polling company he's never run a campaign and it's a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality that guy hits it on one\nElection that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be\nTrue and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this is like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go ...\nAnd ... become flap one and it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold\nSo much and it some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump ... and the er the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it all kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's certainly constitution no it is and\nThen you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of as many people getting in the countries that can Democrats saying the same thing\nBut it's out there it's a conversation starter nothing is going to happen anytime soon the left are saying yeah conversation started his own of is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump does mean\nIt is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded in the snow complicated\nMystery to this is just what it is that's who the opponents are very hell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went and now the Mueller investigation looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come\nBack to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Muller by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen to that would be a leak wanted there would be some kind of education and yet ... zeroes not at the latest from Muller is if somebody is running a scam or name a sex scandal of some ... ... ... it\nSo boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or try to or what have\nYou all all I Know as the that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say in the days and weeks leading up the election is a big deal psychologically I'm telling you these people really thought you you would be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion of this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed mother has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it in his holding it and it's going to release of the most opportune time\nDespite the fact that in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen in between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there is it a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet they're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant rising from ...\nWe don't want you we don't want your wife we don't want your Jewish pretend daughter we don't want your joints son in law we don't want any of you here go away but\nTrump goes to the hospital where the professionals treated the wounded and it gets very very warm welcome you don't see that report it\n[noise] [noise] um\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this and it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you get at the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in the story but it's the same thing and\nPeople say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there isn't a soul out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what Paul you look at I don't care what professional here talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling day though the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ... nobody knows a lot of blood\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good world do you know why\nI think it was was it two thousand fourteen two thousand twelve was one of those\nTwo elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that feet\nWon the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he is intolerable\nSince that one election where he was infallible he hasn't come close doesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver distaste than when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pat canal say packet us in the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll all he does his analyze them\nHe's never participated in a ... you know the polling company he's never run a campaign and condos flight was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nTo the guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be\nTrue and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this is like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb\nTo the temptation here to go blonde vi and become flat line and it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump threat to end the or the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it all kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's totally constitution no it isn't then\nYou've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of as many people getting in the countries that can Democrats saying the same thing\nBut it's out there it's a conversation starter nothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started his own of is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump does mean it\n\nIt is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the

they went and now the Mueller investigation looking at all of us in the more investigation trying to come back to life\nRemember had told yesterday I made a leftist were convinced that Mueller by now what's going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen to that would be a leak wanted there would be some kind of medication and yet ... zeroes not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of something to that [laughter]\nSo boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up to election there's a big deal psychologically I'm telling you these people really fought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\n\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize

out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that how many months maybe over a year now have there\nAbout Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking showed lawyers Nikki shouldn't Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\nOf non lemons not alone here he just happened to be the guy that set it but that happens to be the driving impetus behind\nMuch of extreme liberalism they certainly that is what's driving militant feminism angry women they think white men at the problem white Christian men are the problem in virtually every instance of it dates back to the founding of Africa and this is the organizing\nEnergy force behind much of radical liberalism today\nThat white men are the problem from the establishment of the American government is a capitalistic economy\nUh to the United states in general just setting themselves up as the majority and they now wreak havoc and they get unfair benefits and so forth and so on and so this this is the culture war that we are in and this isn't a side\nThat's why this stuff is all crucial\nNBC News radio I'm I'm Robert President Trump says his visit to the Pittsburgh synagogue were eleven people were gunned down last weekend has moved him mark

talking the freight formal\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean the pumps I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's not on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair\nThey continue to point to slavery as the primary\nEvidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism in slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration\nPolicy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and filled of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood into a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be right medic continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people and notice how quickly they want to do that notice\nHow quickly on the left ... people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things and so I went to the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either loved Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day\nIf you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that didn't raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nIncidents these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said a ... a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group looking number a police officer been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have\nBeen defended and explained away\nWhy people like you\nIn the sense well they're cops and they mistreat their racist they deserve it but don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound to people Steve squeeze almost did die it's amazing these people that way they talk and the things they conveniently

Taiwan there but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is following I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link it to Trump a good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking\nThe hell I'm not sure I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections\nDon't worry they'll get to it when they decided that time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or

remember seeing them go when wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in the last place out there\nAnd ah this was that was pre Trump and the\nBelief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are glued to TV so they believe and then he had a mystery where is the damn thing\nWhere is it Don women even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board caught it had been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered

the one of the dumb somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news there's still a brand new plan going down is unusual and uh we went out to the sea salt\nIn it I'll

contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does don't know if one\nI don't know of a business who ... who who rejects half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news business does\nBut the news media has a habit that does is assuming\nAn operating on the assumption ... whenever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks for everybody cares about well I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted if that momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline than wire Trump's rallies still ... over the he's got one in Fort Myers like in Fort Myers\nYeah Ford my thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies plan between now\nAnd election day\nYou've got all the way up to the night before the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nConsumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration buddy is having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties know what is messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh attitude\nOr anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful\nThinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis was ... you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on the election day and I don't believe in Rio's does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and yeah that's a toss up you want to believe it did not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close I mean we don't know\nWe never know until the aftermath here's\nTrump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies\nThe American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade\nOn this as one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul Ryan why\nIs it why is it when he gives it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America as you know it which is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great piece today\n[noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations\nWe had balls the foreign with her allegations whatever cabin on there that led to the fact of capital is spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming they had evidence\nOf it none of them ever present at any but the media and the\nDemocratic Party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named a Supreme Court he is the passes it gets ... got the confirmation vote and is in sworn in\nWhy did the media drop it\n\nKavanaugh was such a riot\n... S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are rubber rate serial rapists where is all it just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway\nIf the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political\nDont for which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed and the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice they would\nBe out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there is a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of Kevin ... did you believe ball Z forward and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions the reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true\nIt was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about capital of a stir it was all manufactured they didn't bring bossy for up until the very end as a Hail Mary if Woolsey Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made laying eyes terrify the here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYou Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents\nThey still oppose Kevin all\nDon't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week if not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot to wait to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost and okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nWho did it what its purpose was and the proof than it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost and their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurt Democrats hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\n\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women\nThat were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not being sought any longer\nIn Monday Night birthright citizenship is ridiculous and

with us Hi\nThank you so much I close my call I was a twelfth grade\nAmerican history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession and ... was becoming mine and I can handle I started writing my class her cause courses because I couldn't handle how they had we sized American history [noise] what's the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is one ... millions of people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our honors and say come on in the way the Democrats want it to him now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship is specially looking after I take a device him like open up\nThe upper I live and if you had a disease called trek karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you were a strong and we're not when dead\nNow once the ship doctor perform chance examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps and if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people\nWere sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam if you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe\nSo they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that quite not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that the what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then\nWhere am I that's what people are thinking listening to you and tell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets were paved\nWith gold and then I found out I was going to be the one have you on the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people\nThat's been totally left out of history books and I can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it from the world and the whole global buddy not true I have a nine year old grandson and I just shut it to think about it kind of history he's gonna be learning it's um I don't think I'm giving him for Christmas one of your books\nTo oh wow you know very was hurt\nBecause I think that where's he going to get it he's not gonna learn it from his own history books they're all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nTry a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know I I John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties did a survey and the most popular\nHigh school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference neighbor I'm like a one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in an American history\nThe name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zen as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so over Thirty years in one white thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nNow we were a much newer in younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was Rick wired that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were\nAllowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nThe young people in that in that\nRoom erupted into a game standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who have been brainwashed in propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the\nDay holy smokes now let's go to the audio sound like this this folks\nI talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history president was\nGreeted by a hundred protesters singing this land is your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protest or not support what what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump is hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not come in every did come they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center\nPresident Trump's first lady you Monica Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded

birthright citizenship claiming the fourteenth amendment does not say that\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with it but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump has done that that's what conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four a and there are those examples where were you know\nThat that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can\nI can show your countless in in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in herself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four ...\nDid I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty some of them he predicted was off by two but nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen and if you remember the bottom fell out we didn't do just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans\nGained ... seats the left was\nDon ... that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen they ended up being surprised the brightest minds been greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from uh motives are real clear politics by one of the written down their\nPoll analysts and data analyst there is Sean ... day\nI'm not going to read the whole thing it prints out to four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as mint terms and\nHer final stretch and I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten men germs are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionately toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred ten Democratic majority\nBut this is here splitting do a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat what two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't\nThe only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we've just concluded here that the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any further because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not just ... days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races in ... the ... of numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slam Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend\nDay here is we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where it might their talent that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative quality a penny is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests but what about the\nNineteen representative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\nAnybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\nAnd then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money and to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how reliable arms on this thing and then the next\n... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know in the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this\nDay largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens what going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nElse is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the candidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen\nTerm elections and there's feverish campaigning coast to coast in Florida there are too tight races both Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican rather than just want to be governor but Gillum tells NBC's Today show that the status was running a dirty campaign\nMy opponent spend a lot of time talking about they do and helping to remind people about race that I spent a lot of time trying to

first man first man have you seen that I haven't um do I'm fascinated by these sort of cultural controversy around surrounding the movie ... which I mean we talked about it when the story came out\nThat they didn't put the scene of than planting the flag and the moon right I'm In the movie which is the iconic moment of this story\nI mean but the the argument was ... is showing is making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches of the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rocket and the and the flag on the you know the the lunar lander what's the problem\nRight it's an odd choice I thought you know it's the iconic moment of that movie why wouldn't you put it in the movie\n...

party Elizabeth Warren tweeted twenty different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a denizen of Twitter but I Know a lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown\nWhen you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people twenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown\nAnd again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studies to focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American\nDNA the Boston Globe quotes and make up for the dearth of Native American DNA\nDr Carlos ... among pay use samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand\nIn for Native Americans now she's out there touting that it's true or she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any in the in her Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is ... and\nI think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself ... they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ...\nNo no no no no no that was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the meat to move but she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband or soon to be you barking on what\nA stadium chore Oh yes bill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds at twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get\nIn on it there's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has that Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent habit\nAnd I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had it and it really the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\nThe wake of Donald Trump is likely is it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some of the state treasurer of Texas they gave her radio show Mario the pious they gave her radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who had never done it before as a rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed and inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program in Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never\nHas happened every attempt to supplant\nTake over relegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up to get the kind of\nCrowds would they want you may think rushed enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that what we're going to find out\nCommon sense will tell you you'll read Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't drop ... campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would've been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look what I Want to return just for a brief moment to this this notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is the good rule David analyst on the left\nWho used to be at the New York times and then he went to ESPN\nAnd then he went to five thirty eight and then he went to vox back to five or five thirty eight is his company any took into various places\nNothing has gotten rid of Donald Trump nothing hasn't turned the American people against Donald Trump can you imagine the frustration these are people who get their way every single time they target somebody\nFor destruction whenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs on somebody there as good as gone already damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh\nDon't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking use only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't\nLeave with it it was it a central part of the Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball the Ford could not pull this off under pressure\n\nI'm Still in shock the balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was every part of the plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe that uh fifty whatever year old woman literally talks against human she talks that way in her classroom teaching students if she does\nThat mean that just\nAnd I guess it's possible I guess she does but I I I don't believe that either I don't believe that's how you talk to the Baltimore and you're running around the beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to be talking you're running around the beach out there\nUh and she's not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed or yelled out or whatever\nAh anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the real objective\nFrom the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to happen and would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him if\nThey have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... the thirties and those are the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they did was cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turns of people who were sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't any evidence\nThat would warrant such a thing but the Democrats didn't care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well\nNone of it has worked\n\nAnd even in their own post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the\nApproval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy ... I'm telling you that they are\nTeetering on the brink of being hold it altogether being able to hold it all together and it's in this universe framework contacts I just\nI don't see this Massey blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it and if you're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but\nThese are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for him [noise] we'll see I mean look it's possible that I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing\nWhat's going to happen all I'm doing with you today are sharing how I break this now using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground\nActual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against them Democrats having\nFewer seats electoral seats in Washington\nThan they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq Hussein oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen for rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American and check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could\n\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold that tall all Rourke\nRace thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are closing Beto has told them to go pound sand\nThat tone has told them if you're a lecture that important and you're going to raise the money yourself I'm going to ... ... that's the way I Want money used is the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was sold but nice him\nHe had he wanted not part of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\n'cause it was nice the office of the presidency to go that low real reason he didn't want to do with his mom didn't have confidence of coat tails\nAnd that ... is not going to want to share any of his money not being good socialist got all this money it's not fair to back to oh who's by the way what does he down seven or eight points now the latest poll\nIt's not fair that Beto has more than ... and won't share it with other needy Democrats\nThat's what he's saying that he won't do 'em yeah outlook also have the um the ... situation\nAnd there's some things about this guy but I don't think are being widely reported exactly who he is Dr\n... let me just tell you what the drive by its purpose here is again\nThe drive by his are trying as hard as they can to link Donald Trump\nTo ... murder my other way just so you know there are a couple of CNN ... pronouncing your name could show jeep because there's two genes in there\n... it's a very big ... where's your view on a general Native American and I'm like this big for my people I Hope that I'm sick or third or\nWhite people tried to cash in on being native America especially when they're living of big lie I can imagine it'd be frustrating\nUnder my tribe is joining the lowest standard of living in western hemisphere others and have you gotten rich South Dakota so I Know what I'm Talking about it for people I Hope\nWell I was you know what I'm Wondering if this aspect of it I mean I'm here's Elizabeth Warren claiming that she is a member of this ah mistreated minority but what she'd do unfortunately all of this is trying to make her better as trying to make her look better trying to improve things for her she's not\nTrying to parlay this into something for her quote unquote Indian relatives and people\nThat she hasn't mentioned a tribal connection at all\nWell because there isn't one I mean that she has mentioned that she Cherokee because the high cheekbones which I think\n[noise] gee I mean millennia Trump has high cheekbones and nobody's going to say that she's Cherokee [noise] I think I think all of this is offending a lot of people she doesn't want to yourself to a tribe because that'd be the fastest way and they have this blown out as non story\nNBC News radio I'm I'm Robert\nPresident Trump is on Twitter today maintaining he has no financial interest in Saudi Arabia just like he has no such

[noise] Russia one about ... a good question the way why fine on the apple\nWatch works is this and it's it's not as simple as you think I've learned all this by user experience\nThough the watch is always a slave to the phone so that the way it works your phone is with you and you're wearing a watch your watch is ... connectivity is determined by your phone so if your phone is using wife by that connect\nOr even L. T. E. or cellular to connect your watch is connected to it by Bluetooth\nIf the to get separated let's say your watch your your phone\nIs on a wife I network the watch is capable of why but only if the iPhone that it's paired tune knows that wide network for example when I'm at home uh\nI leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range\nSo my phone is not with me but my watch connects the wife by\nBecause my phone is connected to wipe viable watch learns it but I still I have to manually answer the why fi password on my watch for it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the ah the\nPassword from the phone to watch it took me a while to figure that I'm Out walking the dogs and the watches connecting on al ... is that why ... what the hell's going on so I checked and I found out that I had not edited the password for my wife I network on my watch\nWhat I doubt that\nYour mouth to show these phone had wife I connection to the Saudi consulate\nIf it's password required and his wife is sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife I network in there but if she doesn't know the password that phone's not going to connect to the Saudi wife I ended up the phone doesn't connect you with the watch will not\nNow if he had a history of going into that consulate with his phone and if one of previous visit he had logged into their wife I network with a password\nThen his watch would connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered the wife I network password on his watch that's just the phone is not nearby\nI just don't think any of that happened I don't know how proficient this guy was with tech\n... it is possible that his watch could have recorded everything on why fight if he had actually answered the consulates why fi network password independently on his watch\nBecause the the phone has has been long gone with the password does not mean to watch as every device can actually do a wife I'm at work half to go through the password nothing\nIs automatic now Apple's got really simplified here you know you'll people may not notice you and may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncle weeks house\nAnd uncles IQ has a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncle leaks house you ask ... for the password to his wife or you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do\nIs make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever room you are in the house\nAnd then on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find a wife I network at the minute you do that ... phone will get it alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and moguls equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are the guest and his I Will do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them the gas that happens automatically as an Iowa eleven\nYou should try this if you don't notice\nFascinating it's it's it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify oldest\nBut I'm just telling you that the shell game would have had entered the wife I network password to the Saudi constantly ... on his watch\nEven if it was already done on his phone he would have needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife ... worker access it if he done that if his watch works on why fight him at the consulate then he wanted to have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\n\nOne of the car had wife I Know it it it did it because he's the pardon me out of range for it but but it would still need the password still need\nA [laughter] [noise] well I don't know if they would say no we're not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this visit was probably will find the empty okay who knows but\nI doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot\nFrom whatever cell carry over their offers them but even even if that were the case um book\nDidn't other example to try to explain this you're going to a city and you get in a car picks you up the airport or whatever and the car service has wife Ryan it it's just a hot spot\nThe driver gives you the password if you're not sort of your

I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why it's not\nIt's just not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that's the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you hit people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the elections uh the the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have everybody hate Trump\nAnd so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result\nPolling data and says the media so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the transition pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a wake up and realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest\nLandslide in a history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get by\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAre just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide provided that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created\nBetween the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but I don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union but mine was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they it's not hostile sounds hobby on some of the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in daily within within the stupid country for so many years I you willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like they don't then is fine\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade and not going to do it any more they understand okay\n[noise] so\nWhat once again we have here the concept but just so hostile to have the it sounds so hostile it sounds to me it sounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left\nWe want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be wife\nDuring the socialists they think still functioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we shouldn't be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves\nAnd this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on ... says he's going to do something he's going to\nWe've seen positive numbers and consumer sentiment and retail sales but both missed expectations so we're focused their\nThanks Michael this is the ... stock market report with Michael O'Keefe truth and desperate officer for steeple Nicholas in company incorporated member S.

minor correction it's a it's a variety in which the effort by Lesley Stahl\nIs ripped to shreds not Vanity Fair it's six of one and a half dozen the variety is not so much a celebrity focused rag against Vanity Fair is\nA but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors actresses\nTV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is just another sample from last night Trump and Leslie stall\nYou know General Mattis said to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances in states prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you to try one more time\nOkay yeah I Know unless you're not to try it again [laughter] I Know and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but they have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO [noise] but I don't want to be taken advantage\nOf what general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way\nHe's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments explosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice it sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her\nWhy she is undermining NATO Trump already called her out on it for doing this\nThe Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians Trump knows what sixty minutes or less we still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can't sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got on the roster coming up probably do he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating in some of the things I Would tell them but my opinion is with the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said and I\nI think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laughed but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised by this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else have you learned that he didn't know but he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he suffered the treatment is full\nRush Limbaugh\nMuggy like be met for\nRe runs a blog I might not be a\nDa da da na na na na ... stay have the power to take everything your bank accounts your paycheck

how often do you hear every ... both parties\nRunning around and we're going to middle class after the little ... bring the burn through red but we got to ... when there isn't much to cut anymore when it comes to income taxes now which small\nOf taxpayers also paid three percent or more\nIt's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThe top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth\nOf a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone have free point two five percent of all taxes one thousand forty nine people as the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty of which is a little round it to fourteen hundred\nFor teen hungry tax payers paid more than the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent of the top one thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich not decreasing\nIt is not true to say they are not paying their fair share now this is\nAs it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce\nIncome tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if you if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to pay it\nPlus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy but the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for gene hungry\nPeople out of three ... some odd million is it fair that fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change\nBecause if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom settled ... percent so you need to pander to them you\nNeed to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the lived ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to them so much more money than you or is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share of taxes that we are going to ... and so the bottom Seventy physical yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's

they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get votes I Know people are going to support him it befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie stall we were up here at number just as a big\nNumber three this is Trump talking about the necessity\nOf consequences for illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their\nParents it was the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by painted and enforce had one for them you launch that zero tolerance policy to deter families with children and then everybody decided and of course you don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate\nWhen you allow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into our consul you gonna go back to ... lashes\nLeslie for coming into our country illegally and part of\nI mean part of the reason I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states you know my\nFault Leslie I've done such a great job of the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it now\nShe says she misspoke there this law on the ... Obama certainly didn't for separation of just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama dead at dinner had many good reasons for it\nRemember we've got a two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nOnce they see it was on the books but he didn't force it what is that what\nYou mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump has enforce it but the Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included a tempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely wrote a law or just in that the one that separate they don't run from their family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and order in your S.

he was saving them\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat\nOf a hero because the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families whether it's a law that he inherited I've looked at explain why the law exists and it's above and beyond they're having to be consequences for coming here illegally and has to do with the quest for asylum and the fact that\nWhere the parents are taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids are put in much better surroundings and Sanders while their

let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural

everything they tend to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has\nThrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with failure\nThey have failed in every ah tempt every effort to get Donald Trump's approval\nNumbers down to the thirties and the twenties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior let's review some things that were in the news twenty four seven\nAnd the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how to drive by media working with the Democratic party was going to get rid of Donald Trump\nAnd yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about a simply waiting until Republicans lose an election such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for being moved from office since the day after the election I guess what mothers about that is what the collusion thing is about that is what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effective way canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box in twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they wanna destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been\nAbout having ...\nThrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not if they they want him out of office every day now\nThe failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls e forward\nThat was a tool for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem\nThat's what they were trying to do\nChristine Boise for Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael I have a nominee who was then touted as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\n\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue that was after investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead how about\nThe shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida and the creation of a couple of new Democrat Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and\nWhere is he now and where is the issue of gun control where is this story that young people\nHigh school and college students that had enough and they were going to take control of the apparatus of government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the direct where\nIs that the day what happened\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\n\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real what do you mean Russia's Syrian David Logan ... he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David hog did not literally create a bond needed as okay seal Cortez these people do not have connections with an audience they don't have connections with voters\nLike Trump has are like other successful people immediate do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone but nobody's alarm that ... where we miss hog we may want to see up nobody's saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience point is none of this is a real it's all soap operas script material\nWhat's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton has affected link killed that by saying my husband you can't say that he did anything wrong

bye-bye me too movement\nI mean if the ... that random bimbo eruptions unit to destroy women\nClaiming her husband abused them comes up not to defend her\nGuy what good as the me too movement\nAgain another manufactured moment it hit by manufactured my my point about all these is none of these issues or people have the legs to survive on their own without\nThe media fanning the flames or propping them up each and every day that as my precise point Trump doesn't need the media to be who he is Trump doesn't need the media to be elected President Trump doesn't need the media to remain

that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that for this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nA that it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as that as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds wanna leave or one of these things to keep the government going that got nothing in it it burns me up\nAs all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe\nYou know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's just I all I can say that these are smarter man than I Am\nA navy but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding was known\nWith four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump hasn't been on the wall that Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nAll I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but\nMy question is what else do they got\nWell they've gotten my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh\nWell that's exactly right when the moon right\nThere that was four in the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want if not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally that this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house and they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to I don't want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that\nThe leaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he is a a that he's come through and he's twisted them er into doing what he wants\nOut in many of the ... the ... I think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was going to be gone or a before now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the meaning of targets\nI I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story\nOn the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm pale left Saudi Arabia after having that when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince season flu tomato\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message\nBecause the\nClown roast turkey Recep Tayyip air to why he is not one of these guys that wants western influence as we look I'm way long haired have to take a break but that's the answer\nTo your what he's he didn't so many ways [laughter] ... we weren't\nChecking on Russia's log five Ninety two dot com\nMy friends like you I Am thankful every day for the brave men and women to protect our freedom and our country now is Veterans Day approaches I Want to announce that my friends that Mahendra\nAre holding their fifth annual military ... give away the winner will receive a hindrance retriever utility vehicle that's right a brand new read my Hendra retriever one thousand gas model\nLast year's winner army captain Robert forty of Ohio is loving here's my hand and you could be next\nTo nominate somebody who is active duty or a veteran of the U.S military and to get official rules is it Rush Limbaugh dot com and look for the Mahendra military salute give away\nThanks to my hindered the makers of the toughest utility vehicles on earth and God Bless all of you who protect our freedom\nTake advantage of rock bottom prices and test drive on the hindrance today at valley tractor repair in ... or call seven one nine eight five to zero two zero zero that's seven one nine eight five to zero two hundred\nPrices for these buildings all he's not a good windows ... attention all business owners who rent or at least space including storage space stop wasting your money paying someone else for your space you can now see but\nTons of money and own your own building with the incredible sale prices from general steel is right now you can save as much as half the time and cost of conventional construction and stop renting space from other ... eight eight forty one steal to see how general steel can help you save money our fifty are structural warranty buildings are\nCustom designed for your needs you can get a forty\nMy sixty foot building for less than twenty five thousand dollars for a fifty by one hundred Claire span building for under forty thousand dollars there's no wasted space in construction takes half\nThe time called eighty eight forty one steel with strong construction spending in high demand this special pricing will not last long eight eight forty one steel and get your options pricing package on dozens of building options ... forty one steel and see how general steel could save your money ...\nEight eight forty one steel that's eight eight eight for one seven eighty three thirty five eighty date for one seven eighty three thirty five\n[noise] read Russians law that fine dining Casey S.

Fox News and it might be working at least temporarily to ease the brewing immigration crisis south of the border Fox's racial Sutherland live in Washington\nIs to demonstrate to Trump voters that despite all the talk yes and Donna thing to stop illegal immigration\nAnd I think that's a pretty good theory\nAnd then you add in the chaos that will happen then you throw in the possibilities that they do get to the border and do cross but they wouldn't be separated and that's the one of all those issues that I went through the last hour that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs that one dead\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of my one of us\nAnd it was during the time to drive ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families children mothers\nAnd this guy who's up to speed on this stuff\nSays Russia's pictures look basket come on you know the pictures are made up this was ... the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really for one for\nThe rest of the pictures look bad we got to do something pictures were like oh my gosh\nA guy was smart enough to know that he was calling for a media trick but\nAt the pictures of what he was telling me was I Can't defend this I have people\nComplained to me about Trump's separating ... I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio somebody's if you're on hold if you're on the phone to be patient were coming\nU L quick oh this is the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew that\nBut there's four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been right\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately wants Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectively side this process if I put on the spot for addiction but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just the I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer ah anti ... and Julie ... out there talking to fame and Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my comment than\nDeserve to lose like he's bar act on that front he's half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house was very very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into his or her scenario they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold it they don't tell those like I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that are our seats that are in play has only about two or three Democrats ... totally on defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through them to see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is walk a stuff and to me this is totally abs and um the Emmy Emmy what what's the word personality or I mean there's just raw numbers\nAre based on data that as a result of polling\nAnd I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes those rights and times it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand four team and the election of two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat seven months is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rushed the Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates in them\nBut anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done to one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow support their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is does the Democrats are not when the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out remember Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went over like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned map and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad continued to try and portray America\nAs this unfair on just on deserve\n\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative\nSo I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was\nIn predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the predominant ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voted to the shy breakfast votes as a kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason why what was Limbaugh\nGetting this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows so from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by their gospel\nAnd I really think um\nIf I Lived in Washington each and every I don't I

you doing\nGreat thanks for taking my call um I was calling I just wanted their show that you actually um that you did years and years ago that I thought was was just great was probably one of the best show ever hacked\nAnd really simple and you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their you know start a business is you know small businesses and talk about how they're doing you know and where they are\nOr yeah yeah you know we don't want that was you know you you what you remember there was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties\nFolks and white collar employees were being laid off executives\nAnd magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy they were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar\nPeople and not blue collar people and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it right and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things\nLove I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were they were all amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or any of that\nRight now and it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business so I remember I remember it well because there was working in January one or or or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other three day\nThinking that but ah right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrats that stuff I mean which people and people would watch by 'em\nWell don't don't downplay the Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something ... do you think that\nPeople need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy is before they'll believe it\n\nIs that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run and operate their own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I ... I work a lot of hours and I'm and I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make this country work you know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see\nWell small business small but there's no question that small business is uh the\nVast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone well okay\nI I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that week and I'm not I do not have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism for anyone\nAnd not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... mosque in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man\nWhy not just fine thank you [laughter]\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a Britain has been laying stopping anybody from crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is\nAnd they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen and he's done too much into a little time\nOh I don't either get either leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is\nUh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions that we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "19", "locations": [["America", 39.828306, -98.5795],

totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified so there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part and think some Democrats do not think that this don't range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\nWell let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that\nConservatism is made up of their range lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think that that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be ... to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it\nThen the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote intimate [laughter]\nWondering where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea\nWell we don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh for the midterm elections\nIt is a\nInteresting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or both sides\nOf this\nAnd that's on the Democrats' side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party in the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad\nInsane crazy percolating compounding come pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been ... loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen\nAnd his cabinet situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin offered her policy wants to see\nThe F. B. I. documents released\nShe wants a full fledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking talking about Jerrold Nadler of a house Judiciary Committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house that they're gonna impeach cabin or they're going to investigate even getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this side and his cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging\nIn what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I Know it's not even ... like ... but we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not folks that I that I don't I don't want to fall back on that the suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\n\nJust because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing and twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the Democrat rages real and it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it and rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about\nThem\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that\nI can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not but for those that don't get it amazes me that it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative\nOf the uh the party\nAt large here's Jake Christian Adams writing it PJ Media Kavanaugh foes fills Senate gallery was sounds of the insane\nSo if there's any doubt that the opposition to Kevin all of a sudden hinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I have visited this is Chris Adams riding I visited hospitals for the seriously\nMentally ill enlist shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery whereas off and on earth waiting as anything I ever heard in ... and a mental hospital they echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing the stunning with dude\nAnd then the role was called but it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting how willing screaming in an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was jewelry was rage was he\nIt was poisons in the noise\nThey were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness maybe the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment to\nThemselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is in the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about it\nThe Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large doesn't seem to worry at all this kind of discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\nIn fact they may think the opposite\nThey may think that this is what's going to further inspire more discordant\nMadness which will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in to not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with lunatics envy insane face to face\nBut what it means to me is I don't know that they can get more rabbit\nI don't know that there's anything else it can happen that

[noise]\nI Can't prove anything all I have to go on a experience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct I'd just died on everybody believes this\nBlue wipe it doesn't matter where you go every story drudge for example links links to on his page\nIs a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives\nAnd there are stories where Republicans supposedly thinking the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you you hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what I Know what what what what well\nYeah I'd like to get an individual Paul's visual nine percent of the nine seed advantage even after the worst happens with all that that's getting into the into the minutia I'm I'm just talking about over all\nNational attitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm One of these people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons heavier heard ladies and gentlemen that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary\nWon again in want to get in on all this\nTrump action now I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nAct and I'm concerned on interested in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies\nYou can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said at every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't\nDraw flies to her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously I guarantee you that they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but\nThey're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd\nBe they have the\nTrump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\n... with his airplane perfectly placed\nSo the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy to try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe\nKamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got to be able to show the Democrats thinking\nThey've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as\nMuch attention as Trump can draw up till now nobody\nOn the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that their embarking on a nationwide stadium toured\nTaking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this fall it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former

thank you appreciate the I'll ... I'll\nGet right to the point I have one comment one question or comment is\nIt's going around this talking point that uh you know since his cabinet victory that the president is teaching the Republicans how to fight I actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like to lose and I don't think anybody's picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival\nUh and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expanded air hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how long since Nineteen Ninety four and I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ... a\nMedia and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixty and it got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them just even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\nThe Republican I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a\nBuck the Republican governor California is is closer than is running if Gavin Newsom that anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I I think we haven't seen the meltdown that is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again\nUm anything they can come they are ... so certain they're going to win this\nThey've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach capital and Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't think\nI really think they may lose it all\nVery quickly\n[noise]\nYou're\nListening to Russia's week in review\nHey welcome back Rush Limbaugh half my brain tied behind my back as always made interests of fairness and equality [noise] sorry last caller\nSean from Philadelphia what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline from\nPolitical just just today political story ready for this political race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly already leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control\nThis is what you were just telling me right and\nIt you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nOkay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers\nTo eight teams the majority so to resign seats firmly or leaning Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats\nWith this this is a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people in Washington live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling David it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that two thirds nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's going to be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of the nation wide disgust with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the\nPeople of this country despise Donald Trump as a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election night\nThrough thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically pretending this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching me I mean you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're SUV or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand of the first order and\nYou know officer you know\nOur government is separating the two parents that are born or and I am having them\nAnd the cops we bought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch the civil that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates places in this\nCountry where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block cab idiots\nProbably best known for throwing Washington's best dinner parties during Democrat presidency's during Republican president Xi's nobody wanted to go to dinner 'cause they were so mad all the time but she apparently had the best\nDinner parties at her and Bradley's house\nAnd she was on Anderson Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John tower that's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently\n[noise] Don Juan running around the Senate just that everybody that got a nice way this guy had more allegations I literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend him while telling him he needed to resign one of them\nWas a [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of John Tower I knew John Powell I think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only\nBut I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ...\nBy reputation\nCocoa get a picture of the guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught I'll Try to find one here and show you on the digital camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says John Powell once assaulted her but she didn't come\nForward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of hard to be in senator you don't drive around and yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she asserts that happen in a cab\nThat John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was a nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything he\nDragnet rid of this nightclub and ordered Randy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically tried to assault me and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer uh Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and a cab driver would lie about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car and Senate screech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think that and power and got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shot and God\nBut I went to the house at night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn the assaulted by John Tower um but\nBut you know she doesn't want to hear yeah there's one more bite we got Times Square here's here's another reason why number forty three when\nI think about it I thought I'm so glad", "show_name": "The

if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would\nNot to zero but we put very strict limits on and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the

things they had to do to become citizens they have to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and pledge their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians

you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan with\nObamacare your average and you won't premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dump\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to essential Eby cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they like their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out of course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about such things\nSo much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turned out those wise again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives\nIf you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nDid the

drawing red lines in Syria the Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception\nAnd the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the

think about it was great to go you remember who started or remember\nWho and he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God that like you got to look up to see him but you're you're so far been need them you can't see you you just look it up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it is critical minister for rock Obama\nCourt and

on their own behalf that if they step aside and let government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of

point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people will give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally having the president of the states where people up into a frenzy can attack the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man we're has this guy begin to see Trump\nWhipping people up and rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a\nGym you can get but you got all kinds of 'cause you could go be a waiver you obviously listen well\nMr Costa however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou know thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in and do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudge and Ford say for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho is doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting a good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for him to make them maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty thousand Amos let the media and they'd love to hear from me\nAnd everybody on the left the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the\nEmails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nThey think the Trump is recommending and praising ... girl violence ... but they just I I've never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up to this\nGuy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you're doing I really didn't want to see what you're ... you know I'm just fun and what the dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having\nA little fun with you so these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump\nBut you let somebody throw it back on them and it said guy Jared disgrace that show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC not only do not understand the real life America they don't like it much\nThey really have I think what they have about

personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order of Johns and the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's like when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nThere's you know thousands of the line well and they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go back\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can\nDo for we've got a bad we got a a a a bad a connection here uh about\nThe only time I've interested in NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said oh for the audience and and that happened is I get\nThe soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is

Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and ah [noise] ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day it was I Believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings I guess it does have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB want these people that gave suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an S. obey screwed Trump Trump simpler trumps the Nazi this there is no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood into\nThe American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\n\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that\nTrump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and denied entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened and we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\n... Ramos or whatever it is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell tell them no but what is it ... right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise] you know on the street\nI mean they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I asked myself how in the world can this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are the peak of humanity these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nHe doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nThan these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats\nAsked about the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist ed in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over

all never gracious vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony and the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made deployed the military to the border\nAnd threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has doubled down on by the way so this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up in groups or two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nNot worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense that makes it would cause this report is right this is helping Trump's alive with the Democrats do the smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democratic party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put yourself\nIn their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mueller has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a way\nDoesn't work that you can get it it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nTo be tied\nOver there at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to make themselves feel

will expertly explain why when we get back\nMore consideration to people who come from Central America than from Mexico in our asylum and an entry policy it was originally intended to dissuade people from Mexico\nFrom wanted an ally attempting to immigrate across the border\nBuddy it's had the exact opposite effect it has forced people want to come into the United states to first go down to Guatemala El Salvador or Honduras and start the track from there because\nCurrent US law makes it easier to get into the country if you're a trek starts south of Michael\nAnd that's a lot of what's going on here\nBut if you in any way permit\nThis mob but to enter the country after the track you may as well just send out engraved invitations to anybody else around the world and say come on it\nJust can't do that and I have no doubt that whoever is behind this is attempting to pressure\nBorder control a American political systems and it's it's designed to make people I think put up their hands like summer started we can't stop at rush we can't stop it we just got a lot of men we can't stop\nIt I I think it's ... it's almost a variation of a ... hour proven\nOr even Easter sociologists who believe that the way to really transform America the way to really get this country right is to destroy it\nBy overwhelming the welfare state just nothing as many people as possible demanding in claiming benefits to the point they cannot be paid there isn't the money I have the whole system collapse\nAnd then the left will be there to rebuild it in their image based on the disappointment an anger of the people who were left out\nAnd that is a strategic plan it's right alongside the ... lights for literally destroying the United states by overwhelming the social safety net apparatus and that's up I think another microcosm of what this mob is\nIt's a visual aid that shows America being overrun\nIt illustrates America is by itself in wealth and prosperity and that we owe it to the rest of the world to share what it's not fair we have so much they have so little and they live so relatively close\nDon't doubt the politics of this for eight minutes and they are not humanitarian the politics of this are decidedly\nRelated and associated with an assault on America or the purposes of trans forming it into the kind of country of the Obama heights\nWe're seeking and failed to

here\nThis is all politics\nPure and simple total politics disguised as something else\nThe Democrat Party has embraced\nAll of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities and is in the process of trying to normalize them all by in training them as policy planks or issues in the Democratic party platform\nAnd this is how we we end up with people that represent two tenths of one percent of the population being given the whole way of the Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which they otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\nI have I have long believed that\nI just didn't have a I I did not stumbled across the correct way of expressing it but I finally did\nAnd I really do believe that there are many psychological disorders out there that have been adopted by the Democratic party as political issues that are then used\nAs a as as\nThe joined a list of demands on government the government fix that government acknowledged that government or deal with other government funded a that government protect and this of course then turns the Democratic party coalition into an even larger group of minorities\nBut it it conveys

of their voter groups can be whipped up into action by pointing out the mistreatment of conservatives Republicans or what have you\nThey are using immigration and this caravan mob to whip up the Hispanic vote because they can see that Hispanic voter approval for Trump is skyrocketing\nThey are using the ... story to try to whip up the Muslim and Middle Eastern votes and of course the journalist vote which they don't have to do much whipping up there because they own the journalist vote but all of these issues are being used to focus hatred on Donald Trump\nAnd to try to convince people to Trump is responsible for all of these things and a half people so upset and so angry and now they're using transgender to whip up the game vote and and other related people in the Democratic party who are running around thinking that life is filled with nothing but unfair discrimination\nYou just you wait let's see you wait till the first male conservative Republican candidate decides to self identify as a woman\nTo get votes and let's see how tolerant the drive by media and the rest of the Democrats are when a transgender conservative pops up if such thing\nWould happen [noise]\nYou just wait and see what kind of tolerance there's just like there's tolerance for black conservatives and there's tolerance for females who are not feminists that you know how that works out and there is not any tolerance for homosexuals who are not part of a leftist bent\nIf you will [noise] by the way my pants [noise]\nSays that the Honduran president told him that Venezuela is funding this

Venezuela now I've got\nSerious ... Venezuelans have any money but I take that back\nI take that back the Venezuelan government it's like oh sorry [laughter] [noise] it's the Venezuelan people that don't have anything because their government has an all my bad Venezuela couldn't be funding this\nNow parents made the allegation while defending Trump's assertion that middle Easterners make up part why by the way why is have you noticed that Dr buys are outraged by that Trump is saying that there's some Middle East there are some middle Easterners and his character and they'd been identified we've got people down there are better than this thing\nThere are people from all over the place in this caravan they're not just from Honduras in Guatemala and they're not just Hispanic or Latino but why get mad about that\nWhat what what's the point to me there's middle Easterners you know why wasn't why does the median go bad crazy\nTrying to deny that\nWhat's wrong with middle Easterners being in a caravan to destroy us immigration system\n\nHas made this allegation while defending Trump's assertion\nIn an interview with Robert Costa of the Washington Post has said it's inconceivable that there are not people of middle Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people advancing toward the border\nIn the last fiscal year we apprehended more than ten terrorists and suspected terrorists that our southern border from countries referred to in the lexicon as other than my uncle that means from the middle east region\nVice president then reveal that her name just told him the leftist groups from Venezuela organized the caravan financed by Venezuela\nTo challenge our sovereignty and challenge our borders [noise] well see [noise] Venezuelans do have is the Venezuelan government does it you know it's it's\nBecome almost a bit you will to to associate all this with George Soros 'cause he funds so much of this kind of stuff\nWe will eventually find out [noise] we will eventually find out

memoir\nAnd in this book it talks about safe way a lot and he works there didn't work there so she automatically places are self at a Safeway where\nHe is Rachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and like much else that she said impossible to prove\n\nHer report I mean I printed it out it's like six pages here I I it it is devastating the inconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nThe fact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she set in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the\nTestimony she had the idea\nThat she was afraid to fly and yet here she is vacationing all over the world how did you get there the idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California we learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because of the lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans are not demanding an investigation Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to the committee was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she's the last she's not the least credible witness in all of this\nAnd yet there she is automatically said to be credible every leftist supposedly reviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so shaken by what happened all\nThose years ago you can see yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that I don't think for me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I because none of this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil\nVery quickly\nAmericans believe her and most believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored a Harris Poll of a thousand three hundred and thirty registered\nVoters sixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent\nRepublicans who are the smart ones\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent caught Kavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both verbally bubble if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\n\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor in ... the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh shut us down to the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent St rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent or fifty seven percent in favor of confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from forty to fifty seven\nPercent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got combing entering the picture\nNow we've got to call me urging the FBI they keep digging

the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the coral evangelical base in the jail the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so what I think that that's a
