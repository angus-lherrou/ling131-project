kidnapping children\n\nHad an award speech honoring Colin Kaepernick\n\nBut we're supposed to but we're supposed to blame the president for his rhetoric and saying he used to blame for all of this\nJim Carrey literally at age ... all this is going on standing ovation material here folks reminded the crowd that he really despise as president Donald Trump\nKerry made his disdain for the president very clear over the past several months drawing cartoons of everything from something somebody you're in anything on the president's grave to a more recent drawing of bombs coming out of the president's mouth\n\nThat that's right that's this is this is Jim Carrey\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter Carrie delivered one of his most politically charged statements during his remarks at this

and you lie and you say if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor and that's cause if you like you're pointing keep your plan that false than you think politicians should be in trouble for that\nI absolutely I think\nThey are now to count her out of that is designed it right and then the counter side that has this\nUm and I get your point but then they would say\nWell what if you promise vote for me and I'm going to lower crime but then crime goes up three months later do you have to pay a fine for that you get my point I mean you and and and you'd have the politicians who would be the ones that would be directing the the the fines back and forth which also scares me if you'd weaponize those fine\nOh it certainly has to be in a similar to the IRS where that is non political\nWell remember the ... remember the iris when after a Tea Party groups in silence them and attack them\nThat's right that's absolutely appalling and that's\nThe lowest learner and don't

they're blaming Donald Trump for the bombs that were sent this week in the mail that did not explode thank goodness\nThey're even trying to tie the ah attack that happens at the synagogue to the

Donald Trump's fault\nAs the as the left and they they will not stop this I mean you look at this billionaire or who ran all these ads saying we need to impeach Trump impeach Trump impeach Trump he now says that Trump that has created the atmosphere for political violence saying it's it's really trumps fault people need to understand that this is actually\nAll Trump's fault\nThe President Trump in response to this horrific shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue issued a sweeping condemnation of violence in anti Semitism um do you are you satisfied with how he's responded to this tragedy\nRole I think his response to the tragedy is was appropriate but there's something much bigger than that going on here which is the atmosphere that he's created and if the Republican Party has created in terms of political violence\nAnd I think if you look across the political scene but you see is routine systematic lawlessness an attempt to break small D democratic norms\nIn pursuit of victory at all costs ... and we see it in voter suppression\nWe see it in extreme gerrymandering we see it in the violent political rhetoric of course that people have been alluding to all morning for more than that we see it in a president who doesn't ... who is been breaking the law systematically as a candidate as a business person and as a president\nSo a Republican would argue or you say that Tom but\nThere was a capital there was a shooting of a Republican members of Congress last year by a it seemed to Bernie Sanders supporter or what appear to be toxic substances or or folks toxic substances have been sent to\nDonald Trump junior and his family Senator Susan Collins that it's not just Republican lawlessness here what would you respond to that day\nI Would say there has been bad behavior on both sides but you can't find prominent Democrats elected officials who refused to condemn it you don't find prominent Democrats who are leading chance with violent overtones like lock her up CNN

House President Trump rode\nOn Thursday a Medicare or a significant change the Medicare when it comes to prescription drug pricing\nHaving a drug based on the price has paid and\nOther advanced industrial countries is a huge change that's going to save money for a not only the government which means us the tax payers end for millions of Medicare beneficiaries\nSo it's going to be a campaign issue and I want you to know what is true and what is not true and why this can be so good for so many Americans joining me now to talk about that a stream of Burma should a minister and for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services I appreciate you\nComing on tonight this was a significant move by the White House to lower drug prices for millions of Americans\nThat's exactly it and and let me just give you some background first so we were released a report yesterday as well and it can cost up our prices for the most costly position administered drugs that are covered by Medicare part B\nWhat it showed is that on average the United states is paying a hundred and eighty percent more and in some cases more than a four hundred percent more\nThan the international average so this means that the Medicare program and our beneficiaries are spending you know just a lot more than other countries have to pay for their drugs and\nI think that some of the issue with how the Medicare program is set up and the way we pay for drugs and part B which is a physician administered drugs are drugs that you get in the doctor's office is that we're essentially just a price taker there's absolutely\nNo negotiation that goes on and we don't get discounts and also the way we're paying doctors for this as well is that there's a perverse incentive for doctors because they actually get paid more if they are prescribing higher price drive\nAnd so what the president has said and he's been very committed to lowering drug prices and we've heard him talk about this and he's delivering on his promise and what we did is we put together a proposal\nAnd we want to hear comments on our proposal but the idea here is to essentially phase in\nUh the prices that are being offered overseas and face those in for our Medicare beneficiaries to that over a five year period our prices would drop on average by thirty percent so this would be savings to the taxpayer about Seventeen point two billion dollars\nAnd for Medicare beneficiaries it would be about three point four billion dollars\nAre gonna keep doctors whole we're just going to pay for drugs in a different way so that we take out that incentive\nUm to prescribe higher price drugs and we're just going to be paying them a flat rate essentially to administer these drugs but they are going to be kept whole\nThis is not going to impact patient access to medications in any way but what it will do for patience is lower their prices\nYou know one of the questions I Know I'm going to get to hear from people as well how was that the rest of the world is paying such a different price for these prescription drugs than we are and why did it take so long to to make this change\nYeah and that some of the the the way the Medicare program is set up and this is why I get very concerned when I hear calls for Medicare for all because the reality is there are just problems in the in the Medicare program today\nAnd it's it's what is written into law and essentially what it says is that we're going to pay the average sale price a six percent\nSo there's really no room for negotiation and because of that we're seeing prices go up and up um you know I can tell you from where I sit at my desk I'm staying price tags of almost a million dollars for some drugs that are coming out and so we ... we can't afford it and the worst part about it is that\nUh people overseas and other developed countries um are paying much lower prices and so it's time\nUh that America not be paying for innovation and for the entire world and that the the rest of the world also a contributing to the cost of innovation and drug development and it's it's it's time that we stopped Americans being taken advantage of\nMy guess would be same of Irma she is the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services I've met so many people to hear the word change they get nervous they think grabbed to sign up for this drive to change something\nOr is this going to be automatic for people in Medicaid\nIt is automatic for patients it should really be absolutely seamless are not going to feel any change except for when it comes time to open up their wallets and pay the bell and that's when they'll feel the difference there they don't need to sign up for anything there are most people are already paying their part B premiums\nAnd so what we hope to see happen is that they're going to see lower prices at the pharmacy counter and you know over time this could impact their premiums and they can see those go down as well but it doesn't take a than taking any active steps\n... this was a obviously huge information for so many millions of Americans are on Medicare and Medicaid services or the deal with those things that's when the president did this on Thursday if people want to get more information about this uh we're can they go to find out more\nThat's exactly it you can find more information at

country she says people using free speech is the shield to hurt people is not America\nTook him took him literally three seconds every started talking to blame the president\nYou know well he got it right but there's a bigger thing happening here which is the president United States of America this is what he's doing okay I I go back to what I said in that there's just proof of it right there\nYou want to know what the midterms about everything is the president's fault that as a strategy the Democrats in the midterms\nYou have a horrific anti Semitic shooting that takes place clearly the president loves people that are Jewish his own daughter a convert to Judaism his son in law is Jewish or his in laws are Jewish I mean this is a man that that is loves Jewish people but it's his fault they were just shooting\nIt's it's it's actually his fault this is a guy who divided the country and I'll say it again if you support the president nine states of America\nAnd you stand behind them and you're proud I Want you to share but now if you disagree with them and when you're at the angry face you're watching it on Facebook Live and I want to get your phone calls from all over the country one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to the Patriot mode I count phone lines are open now that's not all the time had to say\nSo he implies that well this is basically Donald Trump's fault that we have the shooting a synagogue and then listen to what he says\nAnd I think if you look across the political scene what you see is routine systematic lawlessness an attempt to break small D democratic norms\nIn pursuit of victory at all costs and we see it in voter suppression we see it in extreme gerrymandering we see it in the violent political rhetoric of course that people have been alluding to all morning\nI mean there's so many records you says lawlessness okay so the lawless and so many of the street you have a president Donald Trump that wants to secure the border and doesn't want to care available to break into this country\nYou didn't say that the president's kidnapping these children is the words of Jim Carrey you didn't come out and say that this is the party of lawlessness which is actually advocating for law and order\nDonald Trump is advocating for law and order easy law and order candidate he's advocating for there to be structure in our laws he's advocating for there to be a people not voting illegally and illegal immigrants not signing up to vote in places like California illegally and able to vote in local elections when they're not even a citizen\n\nAnd you want to say this is an issue of lawlessness that this the president is advocating for lawlessness and when he does advocate for the last to be enforced like securing our border you didn't say that he's he's a big it is a racist\nHe's an evil person because he's not letting people break into this country you just said you didn't want lawlessness and then you advocate for a while as soon as all week long by advocating for people coming into this country doing this in a ... and a way that this law last\n\nEight hundred for seven for nine seven three to you know I don't believe that the president at fault and I'll give you an example\nI don't think that because somebody sends bombs in the mail this week and and was a Trump supporter that that's the president's fault the same way\nThat the Utah man that was charged for sending toxic letters to Trump and other administration officials I don't believe that it's the fault of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer Hillary Clinton Rocco bomber Eric Holder\nBy the way this is what the media was not focused on this week so I'll tell you the story because they were only focus on somebody that was a Trump supporter sending pipe bombs and didn't explode thank goodness and they completely didn't talk about another man who did something very close to this\nAnd his political motivations because it didn't fit their narrative federal authorities\nSecurity the indictment on Thursday against the man accused of sending threatening letters to top U.S officials including a rice

we'll come back and has it been Ferguson show nice to have you with us tonight if you just joined us we're shouting right now [noise] about Democrats coming after Donald Trump Jim Carrey now the actor this weekend said that a Republican\nOr Donald Trump is now kidnapping kids the same people that are saying uh then we need to make sure we need to make sure that we bring people together to unify the country then they go out and said Donald Trump is kidnapping children\nThat sound like unification not so much doesn't sound like unification Adel\nDo as I say now is I Do Democrats want to blame Donald Trump for the crazy man that went out there and did horrible things this week by sending bombs that people but they don't cover the undercover the liberal man who sent rights and to the president rice in to the FBI Director rice and to the secretary of defense\nDouble standard they didn't say well should we hold Democrats accountable for what was said nope won't say worried about that\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to let me go to Mike thanks for wedding Mike you're on the bench burgers and show good to have you with us right go ahead\nA yet regardless of response of regardless of a whole is yet I was saying a lot of what side I think the the the point that telling a called very clear is that if you answer correct that justified whatever went down there\nI think that is the wrong approach regardless of who said but I Do agree on one thing is that forty five that's\nWhat they did a lot of people get fired up and art faking it beyond a thought or a you know just verbal\nThing and to\nWhat we're seeing I think needs to recreate the responsible what I Am saying is that we cannot deny the fact\nThat words have power\nAnd they do translate to actions in some instances where\nYou were here here's my thing why is it that no one has brought up the actual violence it's been done by Democrats when they surrounded by congressman I end up fighting I Am\nNot well let me just let me ask you let me just ask you a quick question if you look you look at the Democrat to surrounded the table or the Senate majority leader and through his food out in the street in Kentucky you you look at them they surround the table if Ted Cruz get right up and Ted Cruz face screaming and him were asked to lead the restaurants around his wife\nOr you didn't see any of the Democrats are being forced to denounce sat right the media wasn't interfaces go Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer you denounce the way the Republicans are being treated\nNo 'cause that's not a story they want to cover there is a double standard here I Would love for all of this to clean up I Would love for all of it but remember this is the same\nGod it's on TV saying in peach\nYou know\nPizza president sign up with me and pizza president sign up with me I'm running multimillion dollar adds impeached president because I don't like the president that is a big problem\nThat's the part might that irritates me than\nI Am saying that you know regardless what we say things and they'll expect people to say you know that justifying what why why why not just because we\nHave a a reasonable explanation or answered correctly that it's not right I think I think that is very offensive to the people and this is that what we say that word\nYet I'll have a way of explaining and just\nLet me let me let me break it down let me break it down even more just blatantly All right I I'm assuming you're not a big fan of the president\nI I Am a big fan of justice at liberty or oh\nOkay are you didn't answer you didn't answer my question they look at some of it's not a trick question is asked you\nYou're not a big fan you're not if you're not a big fan of president right\nWell let me put it to you this way I Am a big fan of justice\nAnd the little duck with the same thing I'll just said that's exactly the same thing you just said so I'm going to ask you a third time it is not a trick question and I think it's a simple question right now or you're not you're not a fan of the president\nRight you're not a fan of the president right\nI Can't see you want to justify as\nWell I'm not I'm not justifying anything I'm just asking a question Mike if I had a trick question\nThey go see at one point the finger man\nThat I'm not one of the finger I ask you a question the question was are you are you not a fan of the predator\nAnd how he says that\nOkay I'm going to move on because you're just I I mean I I I gave you a fair shot their answer a basic question it's not a tough question to answer\nMy question I was going to ask you following up to that wasn't as we have the audio already the president responding to shooting at the synagogue do we All right what's what's play that because my question was going to ask you was is the tone of the president of the shooting at the synagogue not spot on exactly what you want from a president listens Donald Trump\n[noise] some [noise]\nI'm On I'm On my hot [noise]\nWell again the\nDo with it if you take a look if they had protection inside as a result would have been far better the views that will always exist I suspect but\nSome kind of a protection inside the temple\nOr maybe you could have been a very much different situations they did that he was able to do things and unfortunately he shouldn't have been able to do I hear the police were outstanding hired the belief that an incredible job it is you know\nWere badly injured [noise] but uh again law enforcement that have been testing job\nNow I mean just just start with that right there they tried to turn this into an anti gun thing they literally\nTried to turn in danger I'd gotten near the media is it is about the gun laws it's about the gun laws we don't know anything about that we don't know anything about the gun laws in this and I mean where they're grandmas broken whether we found I think they were the guns were actually bought\nBut let's\nThe gun let's not talk about this president I mean are you not going to call for gun laws right now because of a shooting that's

people are coming to take care of it we don't know the ... we haven't had any real\nData or information to say these people are here trying to do this just to do a political stunt or they're actually come to the country because they're trying to get up on them all up there trying to go out with all the countries where the law is is so far behind\nWhat we can be recovered handle on it so I mean you almost have to understand why they're real and take the risk\nWell I doubt they're willing to take the risk but I also think that if we do allow people into this country then you're in that what you're doing is I think you're incentivizing people to take these risks that could cost in their lives and their kids' lives\nYou know there may be some security in the numbers of how many people were there right there may be some security\nIn the press sit there that's following them a ... and for the stability that comes with people supporting them along the way because this caravan is a caravan that's being followed by the international press they're all following them they are all telling their stories they're all trying to make you feel sorry for somebody\nI mean that that's something that they are clearly trying to do\nA ... they're trying to humanize and to basically make you feel like there's no way you could say no there's no way that you could say\nA this is wrong you know that that that that you know you're you're somehow evil if you say I want you to be able to do it the right way or you should be doing it the right way and and so if you do let them all and then what does that say the rest of the world it's going to you're going to have a lot of people that probably be be taken advantage of by coyotes\nPeople that may lose their lives you have to\nI Believe you must\nRespond\nWhen clearly showing that this is not how we work in this country so don't take the risk don't take the journey don't take the track because if you do you are wasting your time\nBut the thing of it is a lot of those people are on education they don't they don't even\nKnow what they're coming into they do not even know that there's a possibility that can be military force when they hit the border that they're going to be deported immediately that they may be sent back to the countries where they could be I mean as far as we know that could be murder for going back to their own countries\nWe don't know yeah the whole situation and you know me personally I Know people who come here illegally from El Salvador while I'm all it is bad I mean what they do their children what the government does to their children what government people in employees\nAnd please do I have no ... it's what I said before I have no doubt that if I was poor and living in one of those impoverished countries that I wouldn't want out\nI have no ... you know you could argue that their conditions while traveling this country are probably on par with the conditions they live then if they stay in their homes for their or their hearts or whatever it may be where they're coming from\nRight because it's so bad I I don't think it's much worse on the road for them so it doesn't seem to be so there you know us doing this you'd say there's no way I'm going to go walk two thousand five hundred I don't I don't think we\nShould open our doors and say you know everybody just come on and and we're going to be free everything now first off I like to know who who's give me that data that they go right on welfare because I've lived in South west Missouri and central Kansas and\nYou know they have children legally born in the U.S they are us citizens I don't like you have a problem with that right but and us taking care of the citizens but the parents they get nothing\nThe kids you know yeah we put them in school and we give them that little two dollar lunch when they're in school but my go home they have nothing the parents what worked the\nJunkiest jobs they can get because they can't get regular jobs because they weren't so dirty numbers you know you got got give you their hats off to them because they're willing to put up with our beach\nAs far as way of life but to them it's better than going back to what they came from\nAnd I I Will say a lot of ... ... ... and ... their ...\nNo let me get the point out real quick I Know that there's people who thought they were trying to do it legal trying to go to a a a a immigration attorney and pay him or her thousands of dollars and got taken advantage of by because they weren't even legal attorney but there are so\nLow that there's always there's always people David out there that can be swindle you and I know that and that's unfortunate but that again is not my problem what we should have is consistency ... world ... word

five nine seven three to five three five nine seven three to the eight hundred number one eight hundred and four seven\nIt should've been at least fifty percent done the ... the Republicans have dropped the ball on this did not fight hard enough for this as they should have ... that's the end and look I don't know if the Republicans will build this wall but I can tell you what happens with the Democrats win in the midterms I knew everything they do have a full blown open border\nYeah for sure oh they don't please don't talk about the ah the\nCities where they housed all these legal or you know that they are I'm Sorry they have lost control of what a decent seat is of what the last in this country are at which they have to really spent did they nearly understand that if they will do whatever it takes to remain in power\nAnd you'll do leave the Democrats but some of the Republican and that we use that they don't care really about us\nYou know the the the people that have worked in this country are still working in this country and have made this country great and capitalism is what made this country great they they thought that they have socialism under control I come from that

I'm about an issue that is um you know these migrants they keep calling them come in this country this is political do not buy into the idea that it's not political it is\nAbsolutely political every part everything about this political every part of this is political everything that's going on with this is political everybody needs to understand that it's political everybody needs to comprehend that this is\nPolitical\nThey're hoping that this is going to be a disaster they're hoping that this is going to blow up in our faces they are hoping that this is going to be something where people are going to sit there and go oh my gosh\n\nI Can't believe this is happening oh my gosh I cannot believe that this is going down all my gosh look at how the Republican Party is training Donald Trump sent the military to the border that is so unfair\nThey should have never done that how terrible them to do that how awful it if they did that everybody should be ashamed that this happened that's what they're hoping for\n\nSo let's get to your phone calls on this and see what you think the number one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to Paul in Alaska you're on the bench Ferguson Sharon nice to have is nice to have you want to St Paul go ahead\nI think you can you hear me okay can hear you just fine sir rate\nWell first of all ah we're we're going to take issue as equals three of your points but\nBefore we go there I Want to see this\nGod list Donald Trump and those people who love them as our president has agreed American United States and then ... and I'm white right level seven forge less eager to know I like your show in coal into contributed pending 'cause I like what you're doing\nThat so even if we disagreed who's you know thank you for your show\nSo here's where we go we're letting everything you've said right correct they're setting this up as a political event but the truth is they're doing this because our leaders are letting them framed the narrative this is not a care of the head of illegal immigrants\nThis is an invasion of it is a new age invasion with cosponsors those cosponsors need to be painted [noise]\nThey need to be published so we can see what's happening this is the same thing as an insect world this is not complicated is not conflicts\nPeople in this United States are desperate because our country is split up because they've lost their moral foundations and their mission is a great country those people that hate Donald Trump here's what you have those people who have no place to go because you said for so long enough the public trough\nDid they know they have no place to go there now doing acts of desperation this this in the illegal invasion coming into our country is being sponsored\nI Would think that research or a reporter will be done in a heartbeat trailing all it from the ... one more thing\nWell I mean the logistics of this the logistics of this are clear I mean there there are so many people that are clearly invested in the logistics of this caravan ... they're they're willing to go two thousand miles they know they're going to be taken care of\nThere's obviously a schedule when it comes to logistics because the media is clearly sleeping somewhere every night and it's on the side of the road\nThe media is following this and all the major media groups or they're following this the entire way\nRight but but the point is you have to have accountability and you have to have rational or you have to pay the price for your actions and right now we're not to live for example or store just a minute ago the unions say damn will better be recording these phone calls these foreign countries or ... with some of our people\nTo break us as a country we all we can get to speak for three weeks the logistics of eastern person crosses the border the monetary impact our children\nHow can these people go their neighbor to say look I think you're chose not deserving but I think the one in Puerto Rico or Mexico or one of the many many central South American countries does deserve it so what's happening is the fruits of our labor of being evil and sent out to a foreign country\nSo that they can break the law to support those people here in my up in Newark traders so as long as you use terms like a Caribbean your leg them framed the narrative\nThese people think of I don't want to repeat myself but the point is do we invade Mexico\nDo we invaded so central and South America\nI don't I don't think here's what I'm saying I don't think we invade I don't think anybody has the stomach or the appetite for that I Do think if you don't need isn't the only ... I heard you out of her job problem let me finish I don't think we invade anything\nI I don't think there's a appetite to invade I don't think we should do that um I think what we should do is we should defend our border I don't think this is about the last thing I'm\nGoing after somebody I think this is about protecting your board and that's the reason why I think the president has ITS America showed a realistic response by saying\nAnd this is an important thing by saying that we would he would send the military to the border to protect\nThis country if he needs to and that is vitally important one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to let me go to Paul in California\nPaul you in California we've seen what happens round two of this uh illegal immigration I mean you have Democrats out there that are not only advocating for illegal immigrants to vote but wanting them to vote in state and local elections\nCorrect on what school cell phone with ... children that don't speak English\nAnd they're sucking up all the tax dollars and I'd like to say that the Mexican government is complicit I've travelled extensively throughout Mexico I'm aware of their passport laws and their ...\nWhy don't some hundred Americans probably marching south and see how far they get that will be put in jail by the time to get to the twenty kilometer mark\n... I wouldn't be I mean you go if you started care of and you go to Mexico and I guarantee you are going to be stopped by the Mexican government there's absolutely no way that you wouldn't be\nOn both sides once these guys get up to the border all they have to do is put one foot over the border and lay down its whole political a fire them\n... and they know that that's why they do it\nYou know some stormy there they can't read 'em up because I have to end up on the nightly news\nWell you you and I both know that this is how this works I mean everybody knows this this is this is how it works on average everybody everybody knows this is what you do this is how it works this is how you exploit the system and if you support the system this way it works out great\nGod Bless Donald Trump\nI think there's a lot of people behind them Paul God Bless you you guys could look in California because it's pretty disgusting what's happening in that state right now Scott you are actually out on Scott I hit the wrong button Jay in South Carolina you're on the bench Ferguson show Hi Jay go ahead", "show_name": "Ben Ferguson Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "22", "locations": [["El Salvador", 13.83333, -88.91667], ["South west Missouri", 36.51258, -94.61133], ["Kansas", 39.09973, -94.57857], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Ferguson", -54.78333, -35.83333], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Saudi Arabia's", 29.04234, 35.59259], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["US", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["South Carolina", 34.00071, -81.03481], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Cuba", 22.0, -79.5], ["Italy", 42.83333, 12.83333], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Beatles", 31.111, -83.79808], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Us", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Hernandez", 19.62748, -70.27772], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the U.

issue is losing filing against a week from a purely football standpoint\nI don't think the guy wasn't on a team because then when the football skilled in the form of pro ball there he is an absolute leader I think Caroline and got better no secondary by by the\nCurrent [noise] All right well Caroline is trying to keep pace in the in the south about things and one is we're just looking to stay alive as they head to Pittsburgh satin material is tied for second most is\nHe's one of the few survivors in Atlanta things are\nGoing to solve this problem is simply the\nThey couldn't use read I I mean the man up is the right thing to say it but in reality to soften test carry this group so hopefully they get beyond Jones in San Antonio\nBy [noise] All right but ... says he respects bin Laden was burger but he wasn't afraid to move back to sleep in\nBed hadn't seen me yet and all of us are about that you use the hall of famer Phil fan because a lot of Britain Myers landed a one on one interview process burger you might be facing his toughest task of the Fifteen Years he's playing the NFL he's trying the same ... hello Britain\n[noise] hey Kurt good to talk of lovable even my family does would use that term were with me but I can tell you that that that is not in love with his team's record after a month into the season he did say that he has more control of this deal are all bets on the way that he's ever had\nOver the decade the happier in Pittsburgh attacked as recently as friday he put in a new player new formation of a different personnel hoarding series of new place he hopes will help today no way beyond bell slight disconnect with Antonio Brown would have been worried about this team he's not showing [noise]\nAnybody right now\nWe describe the Steelers are desperate team ready no no no no for games in early in the season we need to have a sense of urgency but not desperate and after the most recently lost with Baltimore the quote you said I'm not playing well it has put a lot of blame on again when you're not with a ball game doesn't matter I think\nThe question is our ab and I know what's going on where's the connection\nDes Moines is I just haven't played well\nAs far as the double still every single plane if I can get him off\nTo a ball where he can catch a run the Margaret\nBe on bill from the outside we watch the the impact does represent what it's been like not having them early on it was definitely there are a lot of questions not know what's going on but once we mostly wasn't here we just had to move on if Belgium and the reports to the team do you accept it with open arms\nYeah we just don't know what it's going to be you know there's been a lot of reports of rumors can this team go to the playoffs without\nYeah absolutely you know they weren't very good football team I think he helped our chances\nLater mama we saw Gerald but going on how much I guess he tackled you\nAbout the run through the past year your bingo you're a tough guy you make plays and\nUh do you get the same benefit as ... as the smaller lighter not use this year actually it was the first dog gotten any calls that still banned so much a part of of your game right is hanging in there until the very last moment using your size and then leaning on your arms that kind of the bottom line we walk up\nOr not want interrupt the blow dead because nobody big plays of happen kind of in that last minute mode\nOver the years the great defense or the Steelers that was that was kind of a ... a lynchpin for this franchise really the last decade or so it's been more about on the office are you comfortable\nI don't know that all the fans are ... you know they still they still believe that defense but you know the the league is kind of change right Peter putting up thirty forty points almost regularly now so you have to\nWith the Joneses and they're trying to score\nThe porches you can I Know it's hard to say now what would have to happen for this Steeler seemed to contempt for the super bowl this year when just when when one game we started the the bad\nThe way you want to start a but but really just take one give us on not look ahead we can't look to the playoffs we can't we can't answer that question how do you get to the playoffs it how do we wouldn't want\nSay to turn it around you can lean on the great history of the Steelers but you can't rely on it as far as getting the ball the brown Antonio put it best when he phrased it as like live five you know sometimes the connection is more sometimes the connection is great but you always connected to expect to have a big game today\nAgainst the beat up thousands detest so as we throw it back we go from lifeline to a guy he was still listen to music at high fine Terry Bradshaw I take it away\nThat wasn't a shot I didn't take it as a shot at all I\nOut that I I Can't talk to talk about this football game it reminds me how he like an MBA all star game yeah everybody shows up and they say look forget the deep I Know deep in the day everybody would score are going to be fifty points bites\nSo no defense today and I guess whoever does have some defense late in the in the fourth quarter probably win the football game\nSurprised of all the teams\nThe history of the Steelers has always been what\nThe the better ever since Nineteen Seventy\nNow it's so hard for me to adjust to op ed fun\nYou get you get a what that kid tightened McDonald's tied in love this kid big powerful guy got to be a lot of fun watching this football game but I think of it as kind of like an MBA all star\nGame yeah is gonna be a lot of fun but you know both teams are desperate then they've got one when as you ought to be even more desperation after today for somebody you know and you talk about the things that you're giving up twenty nine points you came here you can't\nYou can't go that way you can't win a championship that way well they'd let us not any better you know they're just as bad on defense I think they put a little bit of a band aid on his day out\nOn the positive side he's putting up numbers that are comparable to his MVP season two years ago I think he liked it up\nToday in Atlanta missing beyond ... out of Neal ethic that I've heard them be spent the off miserably they get democracy Freeman\nBack which is going to be a big thing for them to go to not only in the running game but also in ... catching the ball\nOut of the ... he created metro problem but it is still a shame that they only have one way with all this talent\nOn often do you have Jones is a new one now really come in with sticks are found that ... I mean really may have all that counted but on the other side of the ball and Pittsburgh in your band and you're going into new round was already talking about I'm not catching a ball enough if Matt Ryan is making great connection with his receivers\nTony ... brown will be looking at been like um it's competitive here I Need to do what they're doing told me the ball\nTo how it before I went to go to the beginning of the AFC you've got Jacksonville the number one defense against Kansas City has got the number one scoring often slip by Patrick well today\nThis officers dynamic with by Patrick homes or the defense athleticism speed talent at every level this is by far I think his greatest challenge today holds\nAn interesting guy in his early in the second year he's not a gimmick is not a a guy that defense you're going to be able to figure out he's there for the long haul or he's the real deal I think he's the combination of for Rogers and you see some Russell Wilson\nYeah in fact yeah there you don't want me out there in a while but yeah yeah yeah I think he had written a why he's great he's going to be great for a long time [laughter]\nYou look like you're waiting to say something\nOr was it it passed a home related to Patrick my home small them\nOkay it's my own poll where we find these guys are going to cost you have to deal with one another early but also wrong

Thursday Night Football some of the names that are coming back this me what the states they get marking we're back to the suspension Sean Payton told me this morning he's going to go back to his

Smith he returns to the rich get richer for the Baltimore Ravens he'll be part of rotation quarterly he returns\nTo the chargers they need him because the injury to boast and everybody thought Thomas

yeah I think because you have such a high base rate on that or an you said that this isn't a tax privilege to count which means you're not even paying taxes at this time I think I Would hold on I

about subjects financial let's get down to the mighty WLS Chicago John it's your turn welcome\nHi, Bob I really appreciate taking my call all of this as fast as I can 'cause I Know your time is precious [noise]\nUm my IRA is fully funded one hundred percent in the vanguard twenty twenty target date funds and so is my wife and her and her work her four oh one K. is funded in what\nThey call the vanguard twenty twenty trust fund which is exactly the same product as the uh twenty twenty target date fund and our I erase the only difference is\nThe twenty twenty target date fund in our air IRAs is about thirty two boxes share and her four oh one K. find it's about fifty five dollars a share so I was wondering um does that make sense for her to do a in service roll over\nTo hurt a higher rate in order to get more bang for her book or almost double the amount of shares\nJohn I'm really glad you called them but I I really have to ask you what in the world are we talking about let's think this through now you just pointed out in you\n\n\nJohn I'm really glad you called but I I really have to ask you what in the world\nAre we talking about let's think this through now you just pointed out in your comments that these two funds or do they have a different share price they are identical in terms of what they own is that correct\nThat is correct All right well therefore tell me if I'm wrong if the assets in that particular ... are holding go up a hundred percent the way I see it\nBut I've seen a hundred thousand dollars into the thirty two dollar per share side of it and and fifty five dollars per share your you're able to buy double the amount of shares in my life thinking incorrect here\nIn my opinion a yes or you're all caught off you're caught off base and tagged out for all in the stadium to see and I'll tell you why I say that are as you make your way as you make your way back to the dugout\nI'll tell you why I say that because if you put one and you tell me if you think I'm wrong\nOr if you put one hundred thousand dollars into the thirty two dollars shares and holdings in those shares double the securities in represented by those shares double than that one hundred thousand will be worth two hundred thousand\nAnd at the same time and the other fund which is invested identical early\nThose that by those shares at fifty five will have one hundred ten dollars shares which means they're one hundred thousand dollars will also have doubled the two hundred thousand dollars we're talking apples and Apple's\nOkay I I really appreciate that can I ask you one follow up question\nSure though I race we recently moved all these find all the smaller IRA money I asked her four oh one K. money from a very diversified a plan to these target date funds because we want to retire in three years\nSo we wanted to or reduce her risk in the market and get a bigger exposure to bonds\nAnd the the ratio and no shares are about fifty five percent stacks forty five percent bonds\nAnd we figured we do that for the next three years until we retire and then maybe evaluate our situation at that point maybe going to manage payout fund or something different or do you have any problem with that new allocation\nGoing to a fifty five forty five allocation anticipating a retirement situation as early as three years from now is not something that would cause me a problem and John I Do appreciate\nThe call always great to hear from our listeners in the windy city and throughout the mid west on the mighty WLS radio\nAnd for those of you that are just tuning in

an\nAmerican church uh and that was overshadowed because of the bombings for most of the country has a week where people are asking the question who's to blame we love to blame people for things that happen instead of blaming the individual we want to blame somebody else\nAnd I think it's unfair to just automatically assume that you can figure out why people like this do things like this when I say it's unfair it's because I don't think you can simply just say oh\nThis is that person's fault\nPeople tried to blend the bombing on Donald Trump saying well this is Donald Trump's rhetoric and it's all his faults and if he was if he wouldn't have irrational things up so much in tone things down this would have never been said this way it would have never been happier never would have been talked about this way never would have happened\nThis is his fault\nRemember Democrats ratchet up the rhetoric about Donald Trump sang impeach forty five and yelling at him and screaming at him and and their followers have become violent\nAt protests and events against conservatives you're I think that that they are to blame for the shooting of Congress men that were practicing for charity baseball game no because I don't think\nThat a person that clearly is crazy enough to do something like this is an individual is that you can hold an entire party or a president accountable for the actions of them by the way they're adults\nWe're talking about adults here older people here\n\nPeople you whether whether you were you know liking a political ... or not you know that is what you're doing is wrong\nAnd we see this happen and people say we're seeing more and more of this descending down ... synagogue mass shooting has a great example\nOf this well look at the man's online profile look what he was doing online if there's anything that inspired him it's the fact that he was able to connect\nVirtually to a community of people that believe the same things that he believes\n\nAnd they inspired one another they ... it's the same reason why we've seen so many people to be able to have been radicalized in such a short period of time\nBecause of the Internet with ISIS and al ... and Boko Haram and others I mean we see these ISIS inspired attacks where we have people that aren't that never even been to an ISIS camp or in our ... camp\nThey're trained literally over and radicalized over the Internet\n\nIs a cause and effect there's great things that come with the Internet there also the scary thing is is you\nYou can literally go out there and you can find a group of people somewhere in the world did agree ... and the things that you believe in as crazy as they are and then in doctrine eight you in them or inspire you or support you or encourage you\nWhether it is being anti Semitic whether it's being racist whether it's being a terrorist or without kind of ISIS or Boko Haram the list goes on and on\nMe you you look at Donald Trump's remarks or this weekend he condemned the the the vial hate filled anti Semitism after this shooting\nPresident Trump fiercely condemned it in response to the mass shooting\nThis was an anti Semitic at Trump's in response to the reports of eleven deaths at the tree of life sent a guy you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we never seemed to learn from the past\nThe president invited a pastor and a rabbi to offer a prayer at the beginning of his speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indiana\nHe said anti Semitism and the widespread persecution of Jews represents one of the ugliest and dark is features of human history\n\nTrump also talked about this event occurred at a baby naming ceremony at the synagogue on the Jewish Sabbath day the gum and reportedly shouted all Jews must die after being in the synagogue\n\nTrump said that anti Semitism should never be tolerated in America saying the vial hatred it filled poison of anti Semitism must be condemn it confront an everywhere and and anywhere it happen everywhere and anywhere and happens\nYou know I I I\nI'm waiting for someone to say oh this is the fault of Trump or this is the fault of so and so why can't it be the fault of the individual\nWhy is it that we are so obsessed why are they so obsessed with blaming someone\nAlways blaming someone\n\nHave to go and use it for political purposes to blame someone else\n\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two we'll get your phone calls in here the patriots without comes under oath and let me go to Ben you are on the bench for August and she'll go ahead\n[noise] [noise] ... yeah I was just thinking about it and one of the things that I was looking at well watched Trump would kind of tone it down just a little bit of when you look at somebody that's about to commit suicide or shop off a building or whatever you just don't go by there and I'm like man jumped ran jumped because\nEven though it's still that person's fault for going ahead and jumping when you go ahead and continue to push people a lot of times they go ahead and do it\nAnd just to some of his rhetoric that he's been using and saying you have a lot of wind individuals that are just like the person that thinks about jumping off a building\nAnd it's just bad if I had a job you know got got you and that's not the right thing to do and so what what I Hope he will start doing in real life and even with what's going on this week\nIt's a start telling it completely down and we all need a talented elements that are are

was about four or five thousand is what they thought now it is staggering how much bigger this group has swelled up well beyond the five thousand they're vowing to reach the United states America this is something that many of actually said that they're trying to\nGet this journey to the ride around election day to make Republicans and Donald Trump look\nLike they're terrible people where they'll show up right before the election\nAnd\nThey will show up right before the election and when they do show up right before the election and we turn them away or we arrest people then they're going to exploit that for political gain in the mid term elections\nNow\nI'll get your phone calls on this and see what you think ah I don't believe that this is traditional seeking asylum I Do believe that there are some sad stories in this group\nI don't think that you should be able to come into this country illegally\nI think when you get into care of and the swelling the way this caravan is swelling I start to have some serious questions with your motives I have some serious questions about the politics behind this you know that you're breaking the laws and you continue to move forward and you can ... can continue to do it I have some real problems with that as well\nSo let me go to your phone calls and see what you think about all of this the number one eight hundred\nFor seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred\nFor seven for nine seven three to the Patriot mobile dot com phone lines are open or get your thoughts your reaction to this simple question is\nDo you believe that these individuals should be given asylum in this country the arguments 'til after saying is that any person that's willing to make this type of trek\nAny person who's willing to make this type of uh of effort to get here clearly is desperate and seeking asylum and therefore deserves it now I also do not believe that this was anything but a political ... move by many involved many that are supporting this\nUm group of illegal immigrants are heading towards this country and they want this to be synchronized with the mid term elections I'm telling you right now this is all about the mid term elections make no mistake about it it is about\nThe mid term elections and everybody needs to understand that\nI don't believe that this has anything to do with truly wanting asylum are seeking asylum in general most people would not do it this way why would you getting a massive caravan that you know it was on national news you know is already being stopped\nBy Mexico on this bridge for two days and keep coming the chances of being successful are very slim and it's being cruel yearly stated that the chances are ... America's saying you turn around we're not letting you in\n\nThat's what America's saying America's sang turnaround we're not going to let you in\nThey know this\nThey know that America is saying we're not letting you in\nMexico as even pretty much made that clear to them that look where America is not going to let you in so then it's Mexico's problem I guess at that point but I don't think this is about coming into America as much as it is about the PR nightmare that's what I honestly think I think this is honestly uh the the night mayor\nOf uh the PR nightmare that this will put and maybe it would change the elections and I think that's why a lot of people are inspired to actually be involved in this they're inspired to be involved in it because they think All right this could change the election America and then maybe I Will get asylum\nMaybe if I if we change the election then we can get the is the the asylum that we want\nThen maybe we'll get exactly what we want one eight hundred four seven\nFour nine seven three two and they keep saying that these are refugees I'm going to stop saying that the restaurant I I'm going to call it what it is a group of illegal immigrants that looks to be ten thousand strong and growing\nThat is what this actually is this is a group of illegal immigrants that is coming to America to break into our country illegally\nThat is what this is everybody needs to understand that that is what this is one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two and should the military be used once they get there if they're going to try to cross\nPeople said the military is not the way to do this to be a humanitarian effort\nThat we should allow liberals and liberal groups that go to the border and care for these people they shouldn't be worried about being a you know a salted I've even seen by the U.S military and who said the military is going to salt in the military because they know sorry you can't come in this country\nI Do believe that when you have ten thousand people coming towards your country\nThe military has an obligation a duty to get involved that I Do believe now you may disagree with me and I'll go to your phone calls one eight hundred for seven for nine\nSeven three to let me go to Charlie thanks are wedding Charlie you're on the bench for August and show how Charlie go ahead\nMan show a this is not immigration this is an invasion\nAnd I think the president by law has the right to do whatever you need to do to prevent this set in the military down to the border and stop this crap once for all my ten thousand people\nSense they seem like an angry mob coming toward your country and go ahead and try to stop this you won't be able to\nYeah and they may not be armed traditionally the way out of a military campaign is armed but they are armed they're armed with all sorts of long headed thinking that are that we know are going to be used to underline the values of this country ... it's ... it's a military ...\nNot in the traditional sense of military campaign but it is it it's certainly a campaign it's funded it's scheduled\nAnd ... and it ought to be characterized as an invasion and we and he Donald Trump is right on the money when it comes to have enough a military presence and if necessary uh you know then that we're gonna have to use military force if they if they don't get the message any other way\nYou know one of the things gym that I think is interesting is is that you know I most most people when I'm and I want to get your take on this do you have problems with refugees coming in this country as long as they do it's a legal way\nAbsolutely not I think that our ... our immigration system is clearly broken we need to straighten it out we needed to straighten out for for Fifteen Years um and and the enemies of this country I have been using this broken system\nTo to to further their purposes and their aims for a long time and a ... immigration is what this country is all about\nThe ... are the the power of of America comes from people who wants to be free and who\nAnd I asked this question why is it that there are other people to try to find the right way that are going through at the right way okay we're going and doing it the right way why should\nThese ten thousand plus get to move ahead of them\nJust because they broke into our country to bend Ferguson show\nMuch more after this caught A R P I found\nOut just how liberal AARP was about a month ago and it shocked me did you know they are supporting to keep Obamacare the law the land did you know they're fighting against almost every legislative agenda that Donald Trump's in favor of well if you're a member of Arab ...
