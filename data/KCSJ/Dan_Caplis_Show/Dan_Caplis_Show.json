you know no I can turn around and say good bye to you know\nIn swing\nAnd only a very big on its after I'm Johnny Caldera Rio three seven one three eight to\nFive five in from Michael Brown yep it's all Donald Trump's fault you see Donald Trump made us polarized and because he says such mean things the logic goes\nNow more and more people are being ugly on social media including this free job who shot up a synagogue matter of fact he said some ugly things on social media before he went to do the deed\nObviously this is Trump's fault it's going to the phones thrilled three seven on three to five five Hey Eric you're with John killed there are so glad that\nYou John how you doing this evening I afternoon I was born and raised in Pittsburgh not not that that I don't want it to the point of view I'm Sorry brass on ... or\nI or I'm going to be honest with your John I I have a hard time\nGrasping the notion that this is somehow the president's fault\nOr you you talked about this because think about the increase of anti Semitism\nI don't think any of us I don't care where you are on the political spectrum I don't think any of us believe that there isn't prejudice and bigotry not only in this country but throughout the world but you know John I have a real problem with the whole hate crime legislation\nBecause to me the fact that they hate Jews that's evidence of motive\nIt does it make killing eleven people better worse it doesn't mitigate it it doesn't compounded\nIn my argument is the argument is that it does make it worse let me let me throw up the argument then respond to it\nThe reason it's worse because he targeted to these people based on their face that they are Jewish therefore by attacking them he is making it\nA much more fearful for Ole Jewish people everywhere in the same way that a cross burning on someone's lawn might be a crime against that person that African American who lives in that home but really it's meant to scare\nAll African Americans and then that way it's a hate crime can be a response\nWell my response is two fold up first and foremost you had the shooting in South Carolina a couple of years ago at a black church OK I'm hate tends to despise religion\nPeople who hate tend not to do so except uh gifts you know I mean I guess you want to counter with certain Islamic sects but by and large hate is an absence of religion is not\nI don't know if not most religions\nYou know I don't I don't know or a because I just don't know and I there is something I listen I I agree with you I'm not a fan of what's called hate laws I I think they're overused and you see I think the danger of quote hate speech is really just to censor people\nThat being said I Will tip my hat to the notion that\nA crime like this\nImpacts a group of people more so than ... and they didn't have in mind ranger strangers in a room\nIt it is a hate crime but but the but the point I was making bringing up the whole hate crime legislation nowadays John I feel that a whole lot of crime this one excludes because of his rhetoric okay so let's let's let's acknowledge upfront\nFor more rewarding vacation tried choosing a location with the culture you are interested in then you can book accommodations that let you come in contact with the people who may if they're\nA great way to do this is by staying in a place where the kitchen such as a timeshare

may\nWell below thinks we're listening to the Michael Brown show him five Ninety to see us\nAnd I was just one room but\nSt minutes for the top I'm John Caldera in for the vacationing recovering let's just say it he's on some bender Michael Brown give me a call three oh three seven one three eight to five five seven won three talk the word is narrative\nAnd he who controls the narrative usually wins\nThe media controls the narrative\nWhat's the old saying don't get into arguments with somebody who buys their ink by the barrel that means\nThey they have a way of getting their viewpoints out it gets repeated and repeated and repeated it gets echoed because one new sources pretty much like all the other news sources even though they think they're wildly different\nAnd they all hate Donald Trump there's just no question about it which is entertaining to me because they have no idea that they're smuggling is in the media they're elite isn't there sticky sweetness\n\nIs what caused Donald Trump\nHe is a reaction to them thinking that that they're better [laughter]\nIs that the best way to put it so the narrative that the media is going to pull on this is that there wasn't any ugliness in political discourse on to Donald Trump came along\nSo as you may or may not know I run the independence Institute\nI've been in political battles now for a quarter century here in Colorado oh we do things like proposition one oh nine which you should vote yes for which gets us new roads without a tax increase\nA lot of people on the left don't like it because they would prefer the tax increase\nThe money that's coming into the state governments going to get spent one way or another but by bonding for roads it means that the future governor whoever he may be cannot take that money and spend it on trolley cars or even more Medicaid expansion\nSo I I put these things out and I'm going to tell you for the quarter of a century that I've been doing this type of stuff\nAnd it's been ugly it's been ugly I've been called every name in the book I get hate mail that would make you lush\nI ride a calm weekly for the Denver Post\nThe comments are hateful just hateful not no I I think Mr ... wrong and and here's why he says this but I really think a better point would be that no no no it's it's personal attacks\nI have a Facebook page and a Twitter page by all means at John Caldera please follow me ... Caldera\nAnd I'm Amazed what comes off of people's fingertips\nSo to have a president or guy running for office who has just been doing what so many on the left already do but forcing it out there and bringing the ugliness forward I don't find\nAs vulgar I find it\nGod should I say it almost refreshing why because we've been seeing it for decades we've been seeing the intolerance for decades so somehow and I knew this was going to happen\nThey're going to try to tie the caravan of Central American immigrants coming up a through Mexico to to this violence yes to this violence here's here's how the logic goes I heard it on NPR so you know it's got to be true\nThat\nThe guy who shot up the synagogue did so because he believed Jewish people were conspiring to get the caravan up here\nNow I have no idea if that's true or not but just just for a fact that it it's thrown out there as the motivation and this is why Trump is responsible for the shooting that's how loony this gets\n\nSo the Anti Defamation league is reporting that there are more hate crimes in the last year than ever on record\nIf true I find that pretty shocking\n\nBut let me throw out the statisticians I'm concerned it goes something like this whatever you measure you get more of\nMy sense is more hate crimes get reported since Trump has been elected because people have been sensitized to hurt\nPeople believe that Trump equals racism and therefore things that might have might have slipped by in the past\nWell they they are now hate crimes and therefore they're getting reported more you're that are there actually are more hate crimes which would be awful it'd be hard to explain that to me\nAnd I don't understand how from\nWould be the symbol of anti Semitism as one of our callers pointed out when he finally did what every other presidents said they were going to do but never did move our embassy\n\nHow was that anti Semitic helped me understand this give me a call three oh three seven won three to five five seven to one three top I'm John ... activity here\nMaybe Casey that's J.\nSprings Colorado was news of an double accurate ballots [noise]\nFive Ninety Casey has Jay I'm Helen has changed their lives gears they one of our very first customer\nHollering my own hair is easier than I ever imagined the best part I no longer had to sit in a salon and pay over a hundred dollars to have this done now I ... when it's convenient for me\nAnd it takes less than an hour people complement me on how great my tolerance and my hair is incredibly San in healthy looking experience beautiful\nMulti dimensional ammonia fried salon policy color for under twenty five dollars and joined the hundreds of thousands of women who have tried and loved Madison Reid\nFind your perfect shade and Madison dash free dot com and get ten percent off plus free shipping on your first caller can't use code trust that code trust and try and love it that's the beauty of Madison\nRead by Casey yesterday was\nDi di di di di di di\nDi di ... Fox News forty six year old Robert Bauer it's brought into court and Pittsburgh in a wheelchair the truck driver could face the death penalty\nDrew magistrate read the twenty ninth federal charges he's facing for killing eleven people at the tree of life sanctuary according to the FBI the Pittsburgh native repeatedly expressed desire to kill all Jews on Saturday\nMy thing is the man was partially elected because he is so politically incorrect and vulgar\n\nBecause that's what's been going on the left has been vulgar the left has been mean they have attacked\nI see it every day on Twitter or don't don't tell me that our site isn't guilty too yeah yeah conservatives are just as guilty\nBut there's something else though there is this this one two punch that the left gives one when they're being ugly and working on the politics of personal destruction we saw that with Kavanaugh\nWe saw what the Clintons did to their bimbo eruptions we understand how they attack people on a personal level\n\nSo they they say it's okay they give the example I should say that it's okay but if anybody tries to reciprocate then they say that's offensive\nWe put it this way so if there was a nut job on the right and he is tweeting away and being vulgar and calling names\nYes that's awful and the left will respond\nBut the left might be putting out vulgar terrible things but then they say you can't do the same you can't do the same to us because then you're a racist or then you'll vulgar order then you're dangerous\nAnd I think it's that dichotomy of\nOf act the way I say you should act don't don't act the way that I act\n\nIt's it's really ingenious when you think about it so\nThe only way you can win when you're in these battles with the left is just shut the hell up which is exactly what they want and I believe for the better part of a decade that's what a lot of America has done they shut the hell up\nIn fact I could read into something like last year's NFL\nFight over taking a need for so many Americans said forget this I'm I'm not playing any longer and people got upset now the luck would say no you're being racist and I think a lot of Americans said no I'm turning off my TV\n'cause I don't need to see spoiled brats disrespect the country for no apparent reason\n\nI think Donald Trump is a spark that says it's OK to stand up\nAnd and not be told to shut up and that's exactly what the media is doing so a guy in the Jewish community in Pittsburgh where the president is set to uh visit tomorrow says the president is not welcome\nNot until he denounces white nationalism\n\nNot until he denounces white nationalism which I'm pretty sure he's already done probably hundreds of times what you just can't do it enough in order to appease left you you got to commit Harry Carey on a stage and spill out your guts and an ask for major forgiveness\n\nShould Donald Trump asked for forgiveness should he should he say I'm against white nationalism now can I come to Pittsburgh and pay my respects\n\nWhat I don't get is it seems as though he's he's getting it from both ends it was wrong for him to move the embassy to Jerusalem so the left hated him for that but somehow he's responsible\nFor these shootings of Jewish people in a synagogue so on one hand he he was caving in\nTo the homeland for Jewish people he was caving in to Jewish interests at the same time he's anti Semitic it causes a little cognitive dissonance for me\nBut then again there are things I just don't quite understand three oh three seven one three eight to five five seven one three talk talk back and like that and get my east coast on\nSo there's an interesting website called slow facts fast opinions come and go here slow facts and I really don't know much about the guy who writes us maybe he's a whack job maybe not\nYeah asked this question after the burgers at the Pittsburgh synagogue I keep seeing this question\nHow do we stop mass murder most of the people asking this question feel strongly about things they don't understand they have not studied the issues of physical defense or contemporary mental health sorry to give them the bad news but there is no magic button\nTo fix this human condition notice he didn't say silver bullet because I Would not have worked\nHe said we can reduce it ... this was fascinating\nAh any puts out three plans and most interesting lasers third point I'll get into these after the break but it's\n\nIt's the second one that says almost\nAll mass murders are in so called gun free zone\nSo make the government strictly

Jay\n[noise]\n\n\nJohn Roberts is focused first time since the confirmation of ... capital\nYou spoke at the University of Minnesota law school\nAnd he reminded everybody that the Supreme Court does not speak for a job as or political parties that the Supreme Court only speaks for the United States Constitution yeah I Know many of you including myself are frustrated with justice chief justice Roberts\nFor his decision in the Obamacare case\nInserting himself\nClaiming that Obamacare is valid because it's a tax then because it's a tax Congress has the authority to tax and so therefore Obamacare's constitutional when nobody\nEither proponents or opponents of Obamacare ever argue that it was a tax\nSo you can take what chief justice Roberts says with a grain of salt\nBut I Do believe that it still bears merit it's that theme I've been stuck on for the past ten days or so that you could actually have two conflicting thoughts in your head at the same time and live with both of them\nAre still think the Justice Roberts was wrong on Obamacare and if you ever read if you ever really sat down and read the decision you would see that he jumped through all these convoluted hoops to make ... constitutional he actually made the argument\nOn behalf of the GOP instead of taking the government's argument at face value but by the same token I take what he says at the University of Minnesota law school and say hallelujah you are exactly correct\nBefore I sit down with professor Stein for the main event um I thought I Would spend a moment or two touching upon the contentious events in Washington of recent weeks\nI Will not criticized the political branches we do that often enough in our opinions about what I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is how it must be\nVery different\nI have great respect for our public officials\nAfter all they speak for the people and that commands a certain degree of humility from those in the ... of us in the judicial branch who do not we do not speak for the people but we speak for the constitution\nOur role is very clear we are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United states and ensure that the political branches act\nWithin them that\nJob obviously requires independence from the political branches\nThe story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence without independence there is no brown versus board of education without independence there is no West Virginia versus Barnett\nWhere the court held that the government could not compel schoolchildren to salute the flag\nAnd without independence there is no steel seizure case where the court held that President Truman was subject to the constitution even at a time of war\nNow the court has from time to time aired an air greatly but when it has it has been because the court yielded to political pressure\nAs the Korematsu case shameful Lee upholding the tournament thrown during World War two of Japanese American citizens\nThose of us on the court know that the best way to do our job is to work together\nIn a collegial way I'm not talking about mirror civility although that helps I Am instead talking about a shared commitment to a genuine exchange of ideas and views through each step of the decision process\nWhich is something that we liked him a public hearing they're able to do a behind the both the doors of the U.S Supreme Court he's about to explain to you how they do their part of it\nBut if we could just do\nIt I don't know why we can I get I mean I I get angry at people will do mastery opinions but I still like to hear their opinions because usually if you're a good listener they'll give you enough holes to drive a Mack truck through\nOr enough rope to hang them four or five times over\n... goes a long way toward just having a strange ideas\nWe need to know each step\nThat we are in this together\nThere is a concrete expression of that ... in a tradition at the court\nThat has prevailed for over a century before we go on to the bench to hear argument in the case and before we go into the conference room to discuss the case we pause for a moment and shake each other's hand\nIt's a small thing perhaps but is it is a repeated reminder that\nAs our newest colleagues put it we do not sit on opposite sides of an ...\nWe do not caucus in separate rooms we do not serve one party or one interest we serve one nation\nAnd I want to assure all of you that we will continue to do that for the best of our abilities whether times are calm or contentious\n[noise]

Saudis maintain the show he left the constantly had nothing to do with his disappearance they're walking back a little bit and saying well maybe with some rogue agents maybe it was broken boys we don't know but western mainstream media\nHave mainly been presenting to show you as a liberal journalist that opposed the regime of the purported Saudi modernizing crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nKnown as India's crown prince ...\nI'd like to know where that started is it just too hard to say Mohammed bin Salman the western narrative goes the NBS had him killed because he really wasn't a modernized to modernize riddle\nAccordingly NBS ... show you kill\nA rival analysis has been doing the rounds the show he was actually Muslim extremists the former friend of Osama bin Laden some of you submitted a picture from the Nineteen nineties of bin Laden and to show you together in some desert\nOutlive somewhere there to show you as an act collide with the Muslim Brotherhood I don't necessarily do that but he was a hater of Israel who called and all Arabs to join the resistance against it and who opposed crown prince NBS not because he was undemocratic because he was not Islamic enough\nBut even so\nWhy would NBS have to show get killed in this complicated macabre and political exposed way why does it need Fifteen men to do that why kill him at all as was also reported to show his criticisms of envy yes had been relatively mild\n\nSources that are beginning to read provide answers to some of these questions in an even more startling account\nThey say that to show he was indeed still very much in Islam was connected to the Muslim Brotherhood but much more significantly he was intimately connected to the Saudi regime\nThis is bitterly opposed to the Brotherhood he was there for the ultimate insider that had gone rogue one of the stories that I read says he was the Saudi intelligence service asset for more than Twenty years it was his report\nIn Nineteen Ninety four that Osama bin Laden was was inextricably under the influence of Egypt and the Brotherhood that convinced the Saudis bin Laden was a lost cause\nHow many if you've ever heard because all we ever hear or\nA level of the of the nine eleven attackers were from were Saudis okay\nHow many uh MS hurting gang members currently in the United states or Guatemalan I mean I think that's a fact without

he was the architect of Saudi intelligence brigadier general useful followed the Siri\nThose people had no problem with him being out of the country but he knew a lot of intelligence secrets so when he got too close to the Qataris into the Turks who are now the arch enemies of the Saudis that's when the show really cross the line\nDo you know there was fiance a Turkish diplomat is the daughter of a former advisor to Turkey's Islam was president or to want to show you started tweeting pictures of himself with while the bars remember turkey and the Saudis are mortal mortal enemies at this point\nTo show he was also planning to start to turkey sooner funded by the Turks and the Qataris\nNow if you're getting resorting Muslim center it was going to be funded by the Qataris and by the Turks piss off the Saudis the meaning of the dissenters the show he was chipping whereas llamas opposed to the attempts by India's to modernize the Saudi economy\nI'm Saudi society it is a complex you

your show like what's wrong with you my lawyer can do it why can't you and we were talking about somehow we got off on\nI think we were talking about something to do with the Senate or the house\nBut in any way I ... at any point at some point he made the comment I Love it when you are willing to say just the unvarnished truth\nAbout a Republican or a Democrat or whoever it might be and I made a and I made the comment joined kind of off handed Lee where you see it because I don't care I don't care anymore\nOnce you reach that point where you do the endless I've said this is a bunch of times before do I care about what my family thinks of course I Do I care about what Angie thanks well sometimes well okay we'll watch more\nWhat I mean by not caring is\nYou have to be able and willing to risk a lot\nIn order to gain a lot and my lawyer retort right back to me I should say retort his response to it was it's it's not that you don't care because you always do care it's just that you've been killed once and they can't kill you again and so you don't care\nWhat they think or say because they can't kill you again\nAnd that kind of feeds into the whole the whole thing the the whole monitor that you hear that you know what doesn't kill you actually makes you stronger\nWell when I made the comment about Cory bookers idea that we're going to give these poor kids fifty grand and they can use it for things for things like the down payment on a house or college tuition some people either texted me on the text line or on the set it on\nYouTube or Facebook now fifty thousand ... ... ... where do you get the idea that fifty grand is enough for a down payment on a house\nThere are a lot of places\nWhere you can buy a mansion for two hundred thousand dollars now as of Denver is a Colorado in general no is it Texas probably not but there are rural areas in Kansas Nebraska Oklahoma the Dakotas there there there are places all over this country\nWere fifty thousand dollars is double what you need for a down payment\nThe problem is is that people are not willing to take the risk because somebody said to me well not everybody can pack up and\nMove that's not true you can if you want to everybody can do almost anything they want to do that well why ever be a first baseman for the Colorado Rockies no\nI'm within the all the really the bat boy for the Colorado Rockies would I Love to be the first baseman for the Colorado Rockies in a heartbeat\nBut I'm also realistic to know that that is not a realistic dream\nBut if you have a realistic dream the only thing that keeps you from accomplishing that is your unwillingness to take risk somebody you're when YouTube just said you know what I did\nI sold my house I think I think it was different if you can scroll through the comments again but I sold my house in Denver move I think the Fort Lauderdale or somewhere bought a house twice the size had enough left over to buy a rental house and I'm the I'm Down here dumb fat and happy making money because I was willing to take the risk\n\nBut most people are willing to do that he goes back to the story I mentioned at the\nTop of the hour about this so called

and it's hard I'm not saying that any of this is easy what I'm saying is if you really want to do it you can't\nIn virtually what I'm saying is most people really don't want to do most people are
