[{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBZ", "content": "But we always stress the fact that you need to have diversification you know it doesn't necessarily when in bull markets but the idea that diversification also doesn't lose as much in their markets\nSo so if you're never winning ... if you'd never hitting home runs but he never striking out that's the whole idea that's the beauty of diversification and it was frankly right now you know ... with with us stocks as high as they are you know they're no longer bargains I mean it's like I can actually you know I can buy the international markets on the cheap right now\nAnd so if you constantly rebalancing sell some of your winters to buy losers sure and then that just kind of helps buffet you when when you know when storms and financial storms come so\nIt's good to know why it's happening but it's also good to know it's a good reminder as to making sure that you are well diversified because it could be a buying opportunity like it is right now according to these metrics but also to make sure that this has said that you're you know you're never uh never taking it all on the chin when bad stuff happening\nWell that's the thing is if you look we always talk about if you want to get on our week remark to report first of all go to S H P financial dot com when you go there you can get we sent this report every Tuesday a market ... ... you know something about the market also a recent copy of our radio show and some other information\nThere's no charge just go to a stage ... financial dot com newsletter sign up and you can sign up right there and I think it this woman was saying about like diversification I feel like it brings me back to the conversation we had earlier with losing Steve in that couple that we were working with\nWe always tell our clients had I'd much rather you'd be mad at me because the market's up twenty five percent and you're only up Seventeen percent than to be mad at me because the markets down forty percent and so are you so diversification if you if that maybe if you want to hit home runs and and try to double your money every couple of years would definitely not the right from for you\nBut if you're looking to kind of reduce exposure as you get a little bit closer to into retirement\nThat's a huge thing and that's what I'll say going back to the same story if you don't know how much a lot of people listening don't know what type of risk they have\nIn their portfolio of you know what if you're the skill of one to a hundred one being all your money in a bank in a in a hundred being all your money in in the in one stock that's risky do you know where you stand overall do any idea I guess the question do you want to know that something that we can run for you run a risk analysis of your portfolio\nTo make sure you where you should be to make sure you where you feel comfortable especially if you're close to her in retirement\nSo give us a call we're happy to do that the number is eight hundred to two seven Seventy seven Seventy seven again that eight hundred to two seven seven seven seven seven or go to S.

H. P. financial and our retirement road map podcast you can you can subscribe to it\nAnd you're listening to all of our past shows current and past\nAh for you know maybe if someone I Know it sounds bad if someone's that something desperate right keep him as someone has to listen to us maritime hopefully we provided a few good I guess here and there are any ways Keith for that being said what was your number one takeaway on today's show\nAs part of our process and our retirement planning a program here we focus on the back end of it which is legacy\nAnd I know attorney McManus touched quite a bit on it earlier\nHow important it is to work with someone understands you know your state and\nWhat you've created who's dealing with a couple of this past week they came into our office they had just created in state plan and they had been where they ... they were working with another advisor and they took their ... or one didn't know you know what the estate planning was how was executed or how to execute it and then to fund\nThat a state planned so it's so important to work with people that are knowledgeable in all facets of retirement not just investments\nGood point Keith how about yourself man and just to stay on the same theme of diversification you know we talk about tax diversification planning diversification kind of what keeps talking about and then also an investment diversification\nYou know here's this align when I read from a report that we had recently diversifying globally implies investors portfolio may not be the best performing relative to any one market but it also means means it may not be the worst performing\nIn other words when you have a diversified portfolio it it doesn't you know it's not the best performing in a bowl but it's not the worst performing in a bear and that is extremely important as you enter retirement\nAnd that's something we see all the time and the first meeting with our clients I let them know hey we think it's okay to reduce your upset a little bit meeting maybe in a really good year you're only going to make twenty percent and not thirty percent\nBut in the trade off maybe in a really bad you're you're only going to lose ten percent instead of thirty percent or whatever the numbers are so we feel like if it's for folks that come to us you know we're going to mix different um portfolios and different instruments you know both market in non market to try to get our clients the best overall risk adjusted return\nBut most of what we're dealing with is trying to take on a little bit less volatility as you get closer to retirement and more importantly in retirement\nAnd my final take away is the story of Stephen Liz [noise] and I know they came into her office in a while back and their clients but when they first came in\nThinking about that he was four weeks from retiring in retiring for the you know he did not want to go back to our trust me in his wife Liz did not want him to ever have to go back to work they want it to be able to enjoy retirement\nThey had an advisor for twenty something years and there are retiring and for weeks and there was NO PLAN in place they were just ... the only plan was yeah we'll send you money when you need it there was no written out plan\nAnd they were at the point where they had said one point five million and they had enough as long as they didn't take a big hit\nAnd so I think I might be Warren Buffett I'm not sure who I heard this quote from but I Love it and that's it's crazy to risk what you have in order to obtain what you don't need to think about that and I just want to tell a lot of people coming to our office as of late 'cause that's what people are doing\nThey're risking money to try to get from one million to two million or two million to three million but don't even need to get to that level to Khattab a comfortable retirement so it's an it's crazy to risk what you have\nIn order to get where you don't need so Steven Liz\nThey came in we built them a obviously a plan that gave them a cash flow that they needed to cover their goals and dreams which for them was to get her motor home\nAnd travel you know travel around the country and different parts of the world during retirement and then have enough to cover the bills that was their main dream\nAnd so if you haven't taken care of your dream planning or an overall plan or you're not sure if you're retiring and the next three to five years and you ... there's NO PLAN in place from where your income going to come from one of the tax Irma F occasions as there is an estate planning all these things that have to be thought about retirement\nTake advantage of what we've done this or we we built our from around the ability to help people like you all used to do on urine to take some time pick up the phone and give us a call we have offices and brain tree Westboro we're in Hyannis in Plymouth mass\nCalled eight hundred to two seven Seventy seven

you know the other markets are just very concerned that okay what's this going to do to again you know companies and their debt emerging markets into alternatives the other interesting area that is really having an impact on this too is home building and\nCompanies like home depot and Lowe's et cetera\nBecause one thing I did not talk about last week is this home sector\nBecause as interest rates start to come up then you know suddenly thirty year mortgages are going to be that much more difficult to afford [laughter] and so people are going to be less likely to buy homes if if it's that much more or renovate homes or you know the whole housing market itself\nOr even taken home equity line on their home correct in in streets will be higher\nAbsolutely and and so like the home builders scenario for this particular year off like Fifteen Percent I mean just that particular sector for two thousand Eighteen so it's just\nI I just kind of wanted to highlight that as another example of how rising interest rates trickle you know throughout the throughout the economy and so many different areas and ones that you might not ordinarily think of\n... about the whole again do home builders thing imagine if you're a millennial that's you know leaving college with a hundred thousand dollars of the student debt\nYou're not going to one another another debt with a higher interest rate on top of it\nWhere a couple of years ago with much lower rates you might be a little bit more we know more likely to to make that big by or to take it home equity line you know that that you were talking about so it's just it's this is going to you know while while and then rising interest rate environment\nYou know we're going to continue to experience this volatility and I just really want to make sure that all of our listeners are prepared for that and as we were saying the beginning have plans for that so that you know what the role of those funds are because even moderate and conservative portfolios can feel pain in these types of environment\nAnd based on your goals maybe you're fine being in the market maybe you're fined being aggressive based on your goals and timeframe and when you're going to retire maybe retiring next year and your your portfolio is not even close to where it should be based on what you need for future income and whatnot as you get close to retirement\nWherever you are I Would say at a minimum to get every single week we put out a weekly market report there's no charge comes through an email every Tuesday Morning\nIn this this week we've

H. P. financial and you'll see the retirement road map podcast if you want to subscribe to it and listen to past shows or listen to shows as they come out each week feel free to do so if you don't want to do that and you just want a quick recap\nOf today's show what the most important parts of it were as it pertains to you and your retirement we're gonna leave you with our top three ... takeaway is right now ... what was your big takeaway\nEarly in the show we talked about following the retirement rules and first one was you know as you start to into retirement\nDo you think about adjusting adjusting your mindset adjusting to the fact that you're not going to be saving money any more but you're going to start to be spending and also it's a nice adjustment in regards to your mindset because now you you don't have to work right you can enjoy\nYour life so it is a big step forward when you do retire in regards to the adjustments that you go through assuming assuming you're spending will go down you know when we build plans for folks that's where we assume and chances are whoa you know with the cost of living and things like that going up as much as it is\nIt's important to plan is if you you know your what you need now is what you're going to need then and go up\nPrepare for alternative sources of income remember people back in the you know my parents and things like that they have pensions to rely on they've Social Security to rely on so many retirees are coming in now a days saying I have Social Security and I've done a great job saving how\n... how ... how do we how do we make this all work so you got to really think about using your assets to supplement in and provide income for you in in retirement no your nest egg no the amount of money you have in the type of money you have from attacks standpoint and when you should draw on each bucket and why\nAnd then the last thing is build a plan for your retirement don't go into retirement and what we called wing it you know you plan for vacations hours weeks at a time he used to spend more time planning the retirement than you do your next vacation\nStuff teeth and just to kind of piggyback on that I mean sometimes you know tell people a story about how you know if you ever sat down for a job interview right and then the person that you know your new boss said you know Derrick Keith don't worry about it you know to just work here and are just call me if you need a paycheck\nAnd it's like no you you wouldn't be you know I'd like I'd like to know exactly what I'm paid for this job and take the bus like no no no no don't worry about it you know to just call me if you need a paycheck and it's like people are entering retirement in similar fashion\nWhereas you know now that their their monthly income to build or do they need money and if they have a plan sometimes it's as simple as oh yeah call me if you need money\nAnd I don't have a plan they don't know where that paycheck is correct so it's like look if you wouldn't take a job without certainty as to when the next paycheck is coming in where it's coming from\nWhy would you ever retire with that same amount of uncertainty so you know keep for rules are five rules is kind of what that builds up to and just want to remind people that you wouldn't take a job like that so you wouldn't be entering retirement either\nIn a in the best time to build an implement the plan is when you don't need it it's before you need it so that you can get ahead of it so [noise] so whatever you're doing right now I guess I Want to ask you you know

[noise]\nYou know we have we ... we share the story earlier marking Karen in and they were in a position where they had a an advisor they had a portfolio but they had NO PLAN in place there's a big difference between having a portfolio of stocks bonds mutual funds compared to an actual plan\nSo when they came in they had NO PLAN they had way too much risk in their portfolio and they were paying high fees when they left what they had was a plan that the ... the risk was reduced substantially because they're retiring and three or four years\nThey had they had a a place they had a plan of where their income was their paycheck was in come from mass and they weren't wing it they knew where their income was going to come from\nThey were able to reduce their fees there are paying and they were able to build a full retirement roadmap plan\nThat looked at income planning investment planning taxes health care and legacy\nSo think about where you are right now think about where mark and Karen where before they came in\nCompared to how they feel now and how they have a plan in place going forward to retire confidently if you if you're like Mark and Karen where they were a few months ago where they had NO PLAN in place didn't have any basis for how they were going to retire if they can retire how much can they draw from and you want someone to help build that out for you\nThat's what

P. financial dot com\n... refund angels retirement roadmap show where you are rude to a successful retirement goldie as each team anytime and one eight hundred to two seven seven seven seven seven or visit them on line that his age being financial done you know here's your host dairy bread\n... the topic of the show was\nIs the majority of your retirement plan based on the stock market and want to give you some ideas on how to change that if it is because that's a lot to rely on your entire life and work life in retirement life\nIs based on just the stock market that can be pretty daunting so he talked about that we also talked with attorney Keith ... man is to see how familiar you are advisor is with your state plan and trust plan to porn that they're on the same page your financial advisor in your attorney\nAnd we talked to keep the client who had worked with him still works for them but didn't necessarily work with us right away back in two thousand eight and the results were a loss of six hundred thousand dollars not because they didn't work with us but because they left all their\nMoney very exposed to the market and then during ... market report we talked about why the markets dropping off or had to sell off it does and the volatility ... it has had over the last few weeks so that being said Matt out of everything we talked about if you're the listener and you can just remember one thing what's your take\nAway well I just think it's just you know having you know just speaking the volatility just if your plan is entirely market dependent and you are and needing to sort of liquidate and take money out you know not just living off the evidence that's one thing but you're actually living off the earnings and the gains\nThen volatility can be very stressful I mean stressful for us I mean this is Mrs ... you know our job is my job and I'm sitting here like look at the computer screen like you know kind of like come on let's go down come out you know what I mean and I'm I'm sitting there like I'm stressed out about it and I couldn't imagine if you are retirement\nWas based on that was your retirement was based on staring at a screen in like yelling at it to to to kind of get better and to go up and to show green nuts when to withdraw money well that that's what I mean so it's like a stressful enough for for people that are in the business I couldn't imagine having to retire and rely solely on it\nAnd try to have a a comfortable retirement when markets are the markets\nWell I Know a key takeaway is probably going to be similar to the volatility 'cause he had a client that necessarily didn't take his advice ten years ago\nYeah these are the times where when people come in again we've been in a\nTen year bull market runs so complacency is easy at this point right you know you sit there you wake up every morning you look at the end of the year ... oh yeah you know gone to the next year onto the next year onto the next year [noise]\nBut uh you know ... does rear its ugly head last year we really didn't have much volatility also that's that talking about super complacent right this year we're starting to see earlier the year we saw this and now we're starting to see it again and I mean this is why it's so important\nTo have a plan in place like marking gene when they came in they had enough money to retire they had enough money to do everything they wanted to do in retirement [noise]\nTheir advisor advise him to keep it where it was and then that delayed their retirement you know almost five years the last five hundred thousand dollars over about over five hundred thousand dollars when again\nThey didn't that didn't need to happen they they had enough money to get where they want it to go that costs them five years of retirement to go with that from the time he standpoint God Forbid something that happened to them health wise me didn't get to enjoy retirement\nAmazing and they came can you imagine it that's a great takeaway Keith ... people listening right now can you imagine like the second guessing\nIf you had the chance you had enough money saved up and you right now might be in this position like market gene had enough money saved up where they could retire as long as they took a little bit of risk off the table and developed a plan their current advisor at the time ten years ago talked him out of the last five hundred thousand dollars\nAnd now they had he had to go back to work as a contractor for five more years when they could have been retiring and traveling and doing what they wanted to do than having the grandkids and that changed and that change and that that we don't want that to happen to you and so I just think I Know a lot of you out there because a lot of you out there like my own family and like my I look at my parents and\nMy dad growing up when he went to work he was a plasterer he'd wake up at five in the morning\nHe'd shovel the snow off of his truck go to work all day come home still have some energy to hang out you know play ball with me or whatever we want to do my mom would then took us into bed and she'd go work the night shift as a nurse in the sacrifices being made to get to where they are I always told them like his dad and mom we don't you want to get to retirement\nThis is your whole life all the sacrifices that we just talked about when it comes to going to work early shoveling shoveling snow off your if your windshield working nights come down to having enough for retirement why would we risk that why would you ever want to risk that so if you're listening right now and you're not sure that you have a plan that's going to take you to into retirement\nAre you a hundred percent sure you have enough income that's going to be generated are you sure that if you ... if you have enough money right now do you want to risk it and have maybe that portfolio be cut in half if we have a market dropped out\nPreceding broadcast has been a
