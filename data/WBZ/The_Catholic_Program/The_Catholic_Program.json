H. D. or a guy who was less well educated\nMan woman or child it's pretty easy for everybody across all levels of society to have an interest in sports I think that's part of the reason or another part of his your excitement of it it's an event and it's a drama\nThere's nothing to match it even goes me the greatest Broadway play you can go see the finest film\nBut even if you don't know how it ends somebody did\nNobody knows the participants the spectators nobody knows how this drama without a script will come out in sports and something compelling about that\nStill why should we spend time talking about sports Dr Charles core the chairman of the department of history for the University of Missouri at St Louis explains\nThe simple definition is sports matters and anyone who wants to look at the changing social and political and economic norms of society can't afford to ignore sports sport reflects our values that helped shape our values it's\nAn integral part of the society even for those people who couldn't care less about sport even those people who think they have never been affected by sport if you look at the vocabulary for instance of the American corporate boardroom\nYou'll see a good share of that is based on sports metaphors there was a an intriguing book about a decade ago coal games your mother never taught you and it felt very seriously with some of the problems facing women\nTrying to rise up the corporate ladder and one of them is that at least for that generation of women they were not raised with an outlet for competitive sports for the most well he didn't understand the vocabulary the other thing that uh I think is important in in any discussion of sport\nIs there a couple of cliches that have surrounded the sport and we've all grown up with them the most important and the most damaging of them is that a sport builds character it's damaging not because it's necessarily fall that can be true which can before\nBut any of us who've ever heard that any of us who ever used that are are actually saying sports builds good character\nAnd there is no reason to believe that's the case we have to get away from the ... sport and thinking that somehow the sporting metaphor is and the sporting values are necessarily good\nAnd pure perhaps even more important for adults particularly parents do keep sports in perspective so that it remains a source of fun for children", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Catholic Program", "city": "Boston", "day": "07", "locations": [["Kansas", 39.09973, -94.57857], ["Washington", 38.89511,
