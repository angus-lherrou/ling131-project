bombs across America\nAt this point fourteen pipe bombs\nWere sent to various political\nFigures some private citizens are in a I'm In a rain that lasted several days and shook up a lot of people as rightfully should but today around the middle of the day and arrest was made\nWe now know the identity and again you know he's he enjoys the presumption of innocence but boy if there ever was a case that looked as if it was sewn up pretty quickly by the authorities\nCesar Cesar ... you know I watched as much as I could uh this afternoon uh we're we're working on a number of projects here and I said I watched as much as I could and I said yesterday\nThat I thought that this would be a lone person than it would not be a cabal of people\nI don't think there's any suggestion that there are others involved at this point and from everything that I have heard and everything that I have read about this case this guy was a complete loner fifty six years old I said yesterday\nThat this would either be a fervent Trump supporter\nA fervent Trump opponent\nOr a nut job well this guy fits two categories you saw his van he's a bourbon Trump supporter\nThese also in that job listening to an interview tonight I Believe it was on CNN with the general manager he worked as as a delivery driver I guess for a restaurant of some sort and the general manager of the company said that he was always very ... very respectful very cordial but\nStrong political viewpoints and like Donald Trump he claimed or that he's a Native American and he's a seminal\nWe've heard that story before the um the ... the tribe in question the Seminoles have said no he's not a member of our tribe\nWe've heard that story the force well so the question that I have for all of you tonight is that last night we were in a situation where we did not know how this story would end I think this story has ended tonight\nMy suspicion is there's probably no more bombs out there no more or the FBI saying they would not hoax bombs that they were real bombs whatever\nA no one was injured that's the good news that's the good news but it's a wake up call for the country and I talked about it last night and it's like to talk about a little bit tonight I think the pressure's off a some people last night were concerned that we might never find out or it might take a while\nI felt it would be wrapped up pretty quickly apparently this guy left to fingerprint and also some perhaps DNA evidence on one of the packages that were sent I Believe the one that was set the Maxine Waters one of the stations reporter whatever this is their guy\nThis is their guy and he's a loser he's a loner fifty six years old apparently his mother kicked him out and he was\nLiving in that van and looked at that van ... plastered

may bomb threats against an electric company so you've probably heard some of the\nInformation that has leaked out [laughter] so my question is real simple\nDoes this event which seemed to have\nSuch importance Wednesday when the story really broke and Thursday yesterday when the story seemed to get even bigger and the number of people who had received these pipe bombs the number grew\nDo you think that this story\nHas any impact on the mid term elections one way or the other that's what I'd love to hear your way you know six one seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten

gave our sons and daughters and their life in a country\nLike annoyed I criticized him for that as well but I think it's whoever's elected president whether it's a Republican or Democrat it's perfectly appropriate for folks on the other side to criticize a and I think that with President Trump\nHe um he gives the as his opposition a lot of fodder for there a lot of ... ammunition I guess for their for their criticism okay mother fought a lot of cannon fodder he gives it to them I think\nYou're right that don't you think it ... the ticket could color shocked to criticize his wife

can tell you very clearly how we remember hotbed they mistreated her her job I'm including\nIf she had to work directly with with the faculties and they treated so badly when he had to speak for herself these people have no tolerance for independent thinkers they hope that crazy so badly that she had to quit when I Do I'm not the price was ... when\nWas the woman who was working for the school was she an employee of the school or was she a student maybe on a work study program\nNo actually she was a an employee of the school\nShe graduated with my daughter very nice lady but they all she had a depression over it you know they they always want her to tell us to do what ever they want and she couldn't decide otherwise\nYou know so they don't really like that well they want to run yeah so I'm not that is the price both ... and all that that's a set of calling\nWell that's an interesting story that than it is truly is consistent and chose a closed minded miss\nA and also they get to watch on an academic ivory tower and they think that so they write their gods gift to the world and you know that's the they've got a they've got to maybe a couple of degrees from colleges and they can teach in a college and that therefore they know everything\nThey want ... and it didn't make believe that they actually like running the show you know\nI've slowly they either there's always

Honduras or a ground ... is in there in Guatemala that come in this way what would you do\nAnd what should we do as a society I mean do we have any form of moral obligation to accept everyone who can just get here\nI don't know I I don't think so but I'd love to know what you think again I say that knowing that if I was in that situation\nI probably would try to get to the United states so what can the can this president do particularly on the cusp of a mid term election within reason\nThat's the question you have the answers six one seven to five or ten thirty\nTriple eight nine to nine ten thirty of introduced a couple of topics tonight which we have not talked about before that is what we tried to do on night side um I can go back to other more familiar topics but I like to try to every night bring it leads to a couple of topics to the table that will make us think\nThink we've seen this morality play before I'd love to know your reaction what you think the president should do what he can do a you know how all of this worked out last spring with the separation of families and all of that so I just want to hear from you whether you're a supporter of Donald Trump or not\nWhat should his administration do when this caravan of people reaches the southern border what can they do six one Seventy five or ten thirty Tripoli nine to nine ten thirty ... light up those phone lines coming right back on nights at\nNight side with Dan re news watch never stops W.

I've been thinking about something like that for such a long time but I grew up Porter's nicer she did you did it's more it's polished and he was exactly\nBut I always wondered about whether the warrant it on my key and all of these extra mile wide open and bring them into support them over the entire life and their families\nWell they're not they're not going to do that because they don't see it like David I mean it would be nice if someone who really believes that set an example there are are there are a church groups that um have gone out of their way to help people who are here\nUm and you know churches historically have been\nOne of the great supporters of people in this country that is what churches have always done in this country across the the religious spectrum so there's nothing new about his idea but but but Davis idea what would the brilliance of Davis ideas it puts us as you said on the individual\nAnd it says it is okay you believe that you really want this to happen why don't you make it happen on your own well\nI'm just talking about those politicians sort of always whip up a political party over something like that and it is it for the people will just to pay the\nBills go the other people you know which way that you're on avenue in Cambridge oh lake street Cambridge got matches that\nIt probably never been in all those loans because it's so ... ... ... one of those people will be nice day\nLet's see if there's any one tonight in the audience who would actually step forward I Would assume hey maybe maybe President Trump\nA lot of it would honestly off of that and say look if you want to assume that responsibility for a family or whatever or because they seem to be a lot of families coming up step forward and and we will do our best to get them to make sure that they're not people who are criminals\nAre and if they seem to be\nSincerely sincere asylum seekers you know what happens is the process as you claim asylum you say look I Need protection I Need asylum because if I go back to my country I'll be murdered ... that's pretty much what an asylum seeker would say\nAnd we have a hearing so what happens is if they go through the process to a point of entry\nAnd and present themselves as an asylum seeker we're we're compelled to at least consider their their claim\nBut during that period of time someone someone could care for them so I Want to give them\nRooms room in their home I think it's a brilliant idea I Wish I had thought of it Michael\nAnd maybe the president should step out and say to two people not only elected officials but rather than middle Americans you know the people who are out there who are very concerned and say you can step forward you can file an application and we will we will put you in touch how would I think it's really\nThey\nThey're like appreciate back it up David Breashears that's keeping roll it Tina is down in ruins socket Rhode Island Tina welcome you're next on the rink central nights like coal and what do you think the idea\n[noise] um well\nI'm kind of a simple correct and I were to ask you kind of a quest center on the ground it better than other people I ... my mind how many people that are coming in right now that said mom do that and I'm either come in and buy grow I don't know how do they find out that they were on their way like lay down or something\n[laughter] I don't know\nI guess I kind of implied in asked that question I think these are much more organized a than than the national news media would have us believe meaning meaning I think that the word is spread and I suspect that there's probably\nIf I I'm guessing now but I Would guess that there's some financial considerations here and then there are people who are profiting from this and who are organizing vis\nA vis this great caravan uh and and I would love to see some real investigative reporting done by some of our networks are major newspapers because you're right I don't think it's just spontaneous that all of a sudden two thousand people wake up one morning and say let's hit the road jak let's head north I don't think so\nBecause basically what I Know it can affect on loving people coming over here\nNow they these people are American can on Central America South America how what my idea that maybe ... maybe ... is more organized and political backup but if you're my aunt there who had an ordinary\nRent you ever consider coming here to do if I'm president I wouldn't want to work with Mexico I heard were ... ... ...

and they could put up let us say a bond for a million dollars\nI think I think a viable idea there would be to get a hold of Mexico get a hold of Guatemala I get a hold of Honduras get an old any other country in between bought 'em all a an on doors and let all these countries along the way no that we're not going to put up with it\nOkay there you go to our country between Guatemala and Honduras by the ...\nAnd then they need to stop it right there\nRight so you send them back or what the president is doing the president saying well cut off the foreign aid\nExactly and it has to be that way hey here's my point that I really think the only way we can determine how many people how this is going to affect us is if we take an actual had can't we can't do that without a moratorium I I think that the best way of having the approach to take and I mentioned is it for a decade now are better\nYou have a national ID card for everyone\nHow can you hold on it\nWhat what their status is just like if you're if you can drive a semi truck or you can drive a motorcycle or a school bus or what have you all you know what your status as far as\nIn this country that card would identify you we have a photo ID could even be biometric it'd be set up for any benefits to the person would get any loans any job anything\nAnd we we would know exactly how many people are here and depending upon the economic situation and other conditions we know how many you\nKnow and that's a whole subject and I'm going to bring that up some night in the not too distant future the idea of of some sort of a national ID I think that's an interesting idea\nA and I and I I I don't want to open that can of worms up right now but but you have prompted me to make sure we'll do something on that\nAre in the not too distant future I'd give you my word on that okay thank you Dan\nNice to have a great and I appreciate your call going to go next to Susan in Chicago Susan how are you tonight\nI take it you know our jeep off that is\nA Jimmy Buffett second cousin\nHe's kind of a billionaire Warren Buffet at Lehman Decatur, Illinois I bet he enjoy he's actually a share of the wealthiest sheriff and the you know and the ... state shouted he's written a book at the state border crisis and he's very anti\nThat law enforcement and he is saying basically that people in Honduras are absolutely desperate it's very dangerous spare the drug cartels have taken our\nFarmers' land to care for forest to join gangs they are coming here because they are desperate because it's dangerous they can't be said sent back\nApparently the United states government has to work with the government of Honduras hit there is one uh extending some kind of financial aid I don't know about manpower but uh maybe some kind of military advice but you know didn't we do that in Columbia didn't we\nMaybe we should indeed Honduras and make it the fifty for state how would that be\n[noise] well I I think if people want to\nStay in their own country will how big is sheriff buffets farm\nWell he you know I don't I don't know about that but he he does know about that he's got a lot of patrolling\nTheir weapons training and he's got to be very wealthy if he's\nIf he's um a buffet sun right\nRight and he is a philanthropist but he is very interested in law enforcement\nTo scrape by the same ... you know they should bring some folks that his farm\nWell anyway the situation in Honduras it's horrible and needs our help the president can help in some way and also Congress can change some laws\nUh apparently unfortunately the union's control the border patrol and there's a lot of red tape and regulation and makes it difficult to act immediately in and out there where it\nSays that you that I don't think the unions are the problem from what I understand the the border patrol agents have very much concerned about what's going on I wouldn't want to be a border patrol agents a tough job\nWell that's true [laughter] anyway the the border is porous close it up in one area they'll come in and now they're\nI mean the thought that you have of of of working with the hunter and government maybe sending US military down there may be a military would do better in Honduras clean out some of those drug gangs for the hunter is government than than others than we had a success in the middle east\nAnd to that point is I mean I got an ... they would obviously prefer to stay in their own country that they they can't uh the conditions are so horrible\nAll right well that's what they're saying in the middle east to the same we can say we got to go to Europe so\nI mean that's a little bit of a cop out I think that if I that people in their own country should take control of their own country but that's a different story well we'll talk about that again Susan I Want to give ... OK okay thank you talk to you let me get market in a ... mark going to get you in here before the break rather had\nOkay I'll be as quick as possible for I Am the benefit the benefactor of America's hum I'm willing to take and immigrants\nSo you're the beneficiary or a benefit you're the better\nSorry the beneficiary sorry I wouldn't exist if my great grandparents went all out and during those ours on drums and my father's a Holocaust survivor yup great so\nWe do have a tradition of taking those who are in in peril my question is more of a general one\nAt what point do we draw the line and say this really is a humanitarian crisis and we need to bring them and you know you should ... should Roosevelt bought the Jews and when he knew about what was going on in the concentration camps and it was\nRigged I agree the Roseville fell down and that but here's the question should we bring in the entire population of Honduras Guatemala and Mexico\nObviously not on my mind is what should determine I'm not arguing on either side I mean I figure it's\nUsually do mark ... I'd like to hold you over into next on if you don't mind sure I think you're you're raising the issue which we need to focus on you stay there will continue this conversation is the next hour we'll start with you we got Paul in Dorchester good root for you you know the number six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten throwing the Hondurans are coming the Hondurans are

saying yeah it's nice don't get it it's very nice but\nUh anyway uh so look yeah last time to actually you know for those who do not did not hear us now\nWe get new people join us itself we are I'm sure mark has been responding to a recommendation to David from Cambridge man we're talking about a group of about two thousand sixteen hundred two thousand hunter inch who were coming north they have a\nLeft their country they're now in Guatemala or let them Allah as we say more appropriately and they're going to go into Mexico and then there'll be at the southern border to couple of weeks from now it'll\nBe a big story so mark was making the point as the um son of political refugees yourself correct\nYes so the grandson Frank Craig ... okay so glad you and my father was a political refugee as well sure and your point was so\nMy point is we looking down the road on doors isn't going to go away you one hundred percent correct with that but the question is is at what point does it have to get for\nThe people coming up should qualify for refugee status before we have to say take military or police action and that is that's what I'm really curious about is if this isn't going to go away how are we going to deal with more and more people coming to our borders\nAnd especially since Mexico can't financially or absorb them I'm sure we make a another an up NAFTA like agreement but that would have to do with um\n... you know we just did it NAFTA like agreement a vote one that\nDeals with human rights as opposed to a traffic um commerce where all three of the largest countries in this hemisphere well share in some responsibility for taking in refugees and or helping\nI I yeah I got an idea and I'd be interested in your reaction to this we're very generous country we we accept a million people every year I think we could accept her more to be honest with you I've said that before so in my conservative friends get very upset with me when I say that instead of accepting a million we've we could accept it we could accept two million\nA year but the reaches a point where you have to say look\nIf the entire population of Honduras wants to come here what do we do and maybe instead of having troops us troops in\nDealing with countries that we obviously had a great deal success with\nMaybe we turn around and we said or ourselves well we have a military presence in Honduras in Guatemala those countries would have to go in and we wipe out these gangs and we make those countries livable were given lots of aid to those countries over the year I don't know where the money's gone I assume it hasn't gone to the people\nMay have you with maybe we have to go in and install some some offshore Terry in governments in places like Honduras Guatemala and maybe even Mexico I don't know I mean Canada does okay by itself um\nYeah ... well I agree with Ron Paul that\nI'm not a foreign aid is way is taking money away from poor people on a rich country they're giving it to rich people on a core core country um and if you ... as\nAs corrupt and such a violent place where we really should look at what we're doing in terms of a foreign aid situation but I guess my question is is on a humanitarian quite well well we'll get to a point where we will take and Hondurans as refugees what\nWe have to answer that with military well their military answer\nWell that's ... that's the ultimate question the question is is we have a policy that says if you you can present yourself for asylum you also didn't go to ... and you could request\nA visa and you can request the right to to come here um and and it's a long line it's a one line how serious it to people in other parts of the world let us say in Africa or Asia\nWho are living in dire straits how fear is it to them for them to to have priority given to countries that have happened to be neighbors or near us\nUm and maybe the plight of people in Mali or or uh or other countries around the world bank would dash might be even more horrific\nWell is exactly that's what I'm asking is what would it take\nFor indoors to become a country that we would that would we think of like in Africa in order for us to look at them or what's going on down in ... on doors that they're sending so many refugees are far away\nAnd what do we do in the interim I don't know where we draw that moral point of the sand that says or more we're going to give you an equal footing or we're going to go in and have a military\nResponse to this or un\nWell here's the thing here's the thing mark when you really think about it okay um what Americans love to do in the winter time they'd like to go and travel and go to sunny places for why why do we not why can't we turned around and say look we're going to turn they're talking about they can't wait to\nGet into Cuba or are busy oh yeah I'm not wait to get into Cuba well okay you can't get into Cuba right now because the Castro family still pretty much has controlled ... why not say look what I'm On a must be David ocean front property\n... let's let's let's unleash the forces of capitalism on Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador oh there are plenty of places in Mexico where people now go for them you know for wintertime vacations and they're not\nAfraid to be kidnapped anymore either\nWell depending upon where you going you know I mean I'm of the biggest thing is but I'm just saying yeah let's turn it into let's turn into a positive smart you re grace questions I Want to have to say please keep calling the show we we love we love the thoughtful conversations thank you have a very nice\nTo have a great now we've got polling Dorchester coming up next less and Leo and room for you what do we do this is a quandary this is a great conversation tonight six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty\nOr do we do to ... keep coming obviously if these two thousand people are admitted that is going to be another two thousand people next month

I Love my opinion is I Love my Celtics but we also got to talk about some of these issues because look think about it if we had the ability to going to say for sure is and clean the country out in a week I mean you they have to know and go in there and just\nBlow it up look them away\nIt it just won't it won't work\nBut it's been tried but again you have to have been sending aid to Columbia for years as from us with a cocaine comes from and show that they gave an amnesty to all the the marches groups in there that are going to shut up their Supreme Court\nI just do not\nHave to sometimes you have to deal with bad people but but I still I'm I'm beginning to think like my idea of go in and just clean them out and make let's say Honduras Guatemala make him an example say look we're going to go in you go in with the\nWith the cooperation of the government did exist we will protect you we will go in we will find the bad guys clean them all out we will allow you get back in the seat and then ...\nWell setting in the Marines is that a new idea but we\nKnow it's worth it as well as George well didn't it [laughter] ... applied to the\nWell what would happen in Panama look what happened in Grenada your the little revolution in Grenada didn't last long did it we went to the Dominican Republic that trying to think sixty five up I remember that remember okay and just think if we hadn't gone into the Dominican Republic in Nineteen sixty five David ... might not have played for the red socks\n[laughter] do you really know how to put everything together\nYes yes I Do\nI Want to wall I like All right if we hadn't had spray paint on 'em and everything and those\nThose crazy rich left wing or movie stars bailout walls 'cause they had them all around their homes\nYeah but the only thing about and this is serious about the wall is once they build it are they going to maintain it so it it does sound silly but I always thought we've got to put tolls off the Puerto\nShelley it might pay for the thing and keep it maintained then somehow figure out what they should have the new world the same time it was settled up\nHere I I think we should we should have tolls coming into the country no tolls going a little absolutely it's like the tunnels got to do that and they want to get one more and I was actually a very very very\nMuch going to go from John in Framingham to John in New Bedford ...

interesting point tonight and it was on my mind and I'm really glad that you're you're discussing this with\nMatters in Central America or Twenty years too late with it as a matter of fact we should've taken this Twenty years ago as a matter of fact we should have done it when the Berlin Wall came down and that's\nNot live it's it's it's my viewpoint I agree with it but it's not presenting it I'm just presenting it was from former west chancellor of uh for chancellor West Germany helmet Schmidt\nIs that you guys are down there taking care of things in Central America\nYou know you need to be doing that\nI didn't really have a Schmidt it talked about that but that's a great point\nYeah he did and if you want it to find that interview with Charlie Rose\nIt is a really good Nineteen eighty nine and it's a really good interview it's one of those that I save what I was a youngster and heard it but that was Twenty years ago that we have ... they were saying to go down there and show the world that you can manage affairs in your own hemisphere and you add a little bit more respect\nTruly a brilliant brilliant project I was unaware that to be really honest with you a and a and I'll see if we can find that but you're right here we are we've always said there was a point in time where we ruled in Central America\nAnd uh and and we influence Central America if there is if there's some we we must know who these guys are that run this country you can't tell me that we haven't pinpointed with these drug operations are in\nEl Salvador they must have contingency plans to\nGo in and knock those things ... am I correct or on my right or wrong on that\nI Would say that we it is easy for us to find out I salute eventually\nYou know I don't I don't believe we have the right in our hand but maybe somebody has a they can spy on them however they however the government does it but nevertheless you know\nWe are being invaded by those drugs here and it is killing Americans and it is messing up our democracy and it's messing up our homes and messing up our lives and we need to go down there and take care of it\nWill ... is nice W supportive kind of stumbled into that thought

talking to Dr Frank and you may have a lot to gain\nMore than any that you're making me the other side yeah\nI was in the news radio [noise]\nMy guest is studio is a tops Fletcher School of diplomacy professor Elizabeth ... uh she has traveled the world I'm not only\nFor the U.S government as as a um represented the U.S government but also a in her career as an academic and we're talking about\nUh the murder or the apparent murder of ... or ... or was it like to do professors get some phone calls have you put on your headset if that's okay with you and do we have some folks are already waiting on the line um\nUh what my ... my last comment here before we go to phone calls and my concern is that there seems to be a real push\n'em by the media\nFor the president to do something to do anything and he seems to be resisting that push now obviously this fellow ... ... pretty well known 'em and wrote for the Washington Post I'm just wondering if he had been just a journalist for\nI don't know you know what a ... a major newspaper in Saudi Arabia or if it would have a really got as much traction as it has\nI think that there would have been the same amount attraction I mean this is ultimately a story about us Saudi relations right he's written a fire for that so when either had written for\nYou know a small newspaper or as in this case the Washington Post I think they would have been a lot of attention first there's the just you know truly horrific and grizzly story at south\nBut the other thing is there's a lot riding on the U.S Saudi relationship and what you know his death tells us so\nWho stands to gain for example for the ... for the ... from the disc crediting of Mohammed bin some on certainly you know the anti reform asked anti\nLiberalizing if I dare use such a term but anti reformist elements in the Saudi political and religious establishment they stand to lose um so the conservative hyper conservative stand to gain who else stands to gain from\nUh the discredited of NBS Iran stands to gain after all we know that you know strong competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran along\nA confessional lines Sunday and the former Shiite and a lot are so Iran stands to gain another country in the region that stands to gain and I think they've played a very prominent role ironically and all this another authoritarian\nUm government or Islamist government namely turkey turkey and Saudi Arabia there's tension between them because of Turkey's pretensions ...\nKind of ... the first among equals of the Sunni Muslim I'm and we're already states so there's a lot\nOf Saudis in somebody's in a war with with Yemen right right and it's right apparently ... ... ... not necessarily playing according to the the code of warfare right there really is a code of warfare right uh and I'm In in Saudi Arabia is very important to the United states so let's see let's see what our listeners have to say we're going to go first to um\nCalifornia Robert is calling in from\nCalifornia Robin is a regular listener out in California Robin you first sign of the rings central nice icon aligned with professor ... ... go right ahead Robert\nAid and can you hear me okay ... you're on a speakerphone I Am going to come out but I like that better\nOff the speaker phone is always better go ahead Robert\n... wonderful so I'm gonna try to connect some dots here and the professor can probably help out with this with this whole situation so we we got to go back to the early eighties for the uncle had gone to show the a lot of people don't remember those who ... who could also sold guys do but Donald Trump\nBought at around ... there was that was a larger shot in the world at the time\nAnd uh he ended up selling it to Donald Trump now later on a a friend of add on to show these out ... ... ...\nHe was one of the Saudi princes but without family he ended up belly Donald Trump out to the tune a probably a couple of billion dollars by interest in his uh different companies along those lines and he ended up buying back itself that what's really interesting is that at night to show the a lot of people\nProbably don't know this but he was he was married in a in a it was it go between starting my words are just keeping me today but he was a go between between the Bush administration and Richard ... to be specific\nA net behind the scenes cause show set up the meeting with us some Saudi diplomats in order to get permission to ever get sick you permission to invade Iraq in two thousand and three and a show give us kind of go between guy so he's\nThe youngster has while we were which ... not this the victim could show you're saying is on ...\nKnow his uncle Vietnam\n... is an issue of the ... let me just make sure that a professor um ...\nAgrees with your analysis so far 'cause we're throwing a lot of names and a lot of a lot of ... circumstances of this is Robert ... yeah the facts as you've presented them Robin are absolutely go ahead Robert Siegel right\nThis week when I was in D.C someone said to me okay the Saudis are finished in this town well placed inside her I I I I think that's a hyperbole um is this a game changer probably not a but the question then becomes what to do so there's\nCut all ties full diplomatic rupture at the other end of the spectrum it's business as usual this was just an unpleasant blip on the radar screen but then there's a whole host of things in the mental and I think that's where we're probably going to land on this somewhere in the middle so for example there are symbolic things like\nA secretary of treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin he's deciding whether or not in fact tomorrow would be given to figure out if he's going to pull the plug on his trip to the Saudi future investment initiative conference and that's a showcase event now by the Saudi Government and NBS at a time when the Saudi economy\nUh is is not doing that well um and we know that you know a lot of high profile figures from uh from Europe but also from the U.S I've\nAlready canceled their um their parents at the conference so that would send a powerful symbolic message that you know there's a ... their economic consequences even indirect from this kind of behavior another thing we can do is\nUm we could use a targeted approach we could use what's called the global Magnitsky Act\nAnd that's a piece of legislation that has the power of the U. S. has the power to freeze the assets on banned\nThe visas of gross human rights violators and we've used that I'm against members of the ... regime the ... government we actually use that against members of the Turkish government uh during the Brunson period\nSo you can't get into the U.S can't travel here your assets are frozen frozen again it's a targeted mechanism and it was designed in many ways precisely to be that kind of targeted a response not\nFull blown economic sanctions but something that targets the individuals\nThat are held on Iraq is not likely to sit back and enjoy that and this is a period of time we're about to rebel to cut off the the oil production coming out of Iran we're going to be more reliant this winter on on Saudi oil I assume even though that's a fun fungible\nAsset I get that we're ... we're we're relying on Saudi oil and the Saudis are relying on an Saudi oil let's not forget that this whole liberalization project of MBBS and\nThat Saudi vision twenty thirty I'm you know for liberalizing society reforming the economy really pivoted on him move away an effort to diversify\nThe kingdom's economic resource base of the country would no longer be dependent on the export of a single commodity to basically drive the entire economy so the economic rationale and the\nAbility to kind of you know tightened our economic squeeze on Saturdays on Saudi Arabia I think is actually there they may we may need their oil but they actually need us and frankly since you know um since fracking and and\nUm you know and shall et cetera et cetera our dependence on foreign oil in particular Saudi oil has been a you know has has declined and has made it easier for us to to exercise a kind of leverage to you on\nTalk of Google going forward in the next few days of the dynamic that we're probably going to see is more and more members of the Senate particular members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrats or Republicans are going to be be rattling the cage for some action of the Trump Administration has put a lot of chips\nOn improving relationships and economic relationships uh ... vice Saudi Arabia\nPurchases military goods and other materials from the U.S [noise] um I understand the Trump administration's hesitancy in the short term to do anything dramatic but how long will the pressure last do you think I mean we're we're coming up on mid term elections and\nThere'll be a big snowstorm and the attention span is this is this a tempest that is going to dissipate quickly or do you think this is going to hang around\nI think it's going to hang around I think the midterms are really going to uh you know interrupt the attention span but let's not forget even before this event there's been a lot of talk and a lot of debate in DC about um re calibrating our relationship with Saudi\nSupport for the relationship with M. B. S. but also re calibrating the way in which we support them and most specifically there's been a huge debate in Congress about I'm suspending weapons to Saudi Arabia us weapons to Saudi Arabia that have been used to ... to prosecute the war in Yemen I mean the the Yemen the war in Yemen as a\n... a colossal humanitarian catastrophe it's a calamity ... literally millions of children\nUm it's produced just massive civilian ... off you know that antiseptic term we use collateral damage and so there's been a debate even before that says I'm going to run his some responsibility and that was like absolutely but I mean we're not supporting your on and we are I don't\nKnow yet it but but we're supporting Saudi Arabia\nSo we're providing targeting information to Saudi Arabia that's supposed to be precision and minimize civilian casualties instead you've got you know saw Saudi bombing missions on a on a on hospitals on schools\nUm massive civilian casualties there is a cholera outbreak the Saudis have been supportive of allowing 'em you know humanitarian medical assistance into Yemen so there's already been a discussion about\nIf and be one of NBS his signature foreign policy initiatives has been this war in Yemen presumably to contain Iran\nIt's produced massive blow back in terms of\nHow the U. S. has seen his ability to be a leader I'm In a move too fast too quickly and created too much damage so again even after the midterms through the midterms after the midterms this particular issue now Yemen War and us weapons used in the ... is likely to come\nBack and then final complicated question and the short answer always the lynchpin\nOf these conversations the middle east has to revolve around Israel Israel is not doing anything they're not saying anything they probably know more than they they're letting on right now but this could impact the balance of power in the middle east I assume at some point\nIt could I think again one of the things we need to focus on is the fact that ah the relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia has improved a firm that only under this administration again that speaks to the person of\nJared Kushner who's run point on the Saudi Israeli relationship so we there's a lot riding again on trying to sort of\nMinimize the damage to um Mohammed bin saw him on that comes out of out of this incident and and not relates to keeping the Saudi Israeli relationship going in the direction that it is right now\nProfessor Elizabeth ... ah I've learned a lot a in this hour hope my audience has as well thank you Dan a look to have you back as this this um this sort of a\nCrisis or either dissipates or erupts even further I think it's been a pleasure to talk with aspirin great loving to come back you will you will or we will invite should they wrote a great guess appreciate very much\nUh we'll be back to the other side of that ad o'clock news going to talk a little domestic politics little Massachusetts politics later I got to talk about the Jones ... forty years ago next month\nLearn how new treatments are helping those with severe asthma from the experts at Tufts Medical center now at W. busy ten thirty dot com slash health Massey\nAbove the fold we're going to get to that admitted dealing with this whole issue I didn't realize so little was going on in the world that um the globe devote\nThe above the fold headlined three days in a row to the Elizabeth Warren ... or so the article on the news article by Maggie\nEsther and again this is the New York times so this important we're not talking about Breitbart News here if Senator Elizabeth Warren thought they're releasing her DNA test results showing Native American ancestry neutralize a Republican line of attack she was wrong\nThe test pilot proof strategic preparations for a likely presidential campaign datsun\nUnderstood understatement did not placate President Trump who was mocked ... Warren as Pocahontas and once promised a million dollars to a charity a pro choice if a DNA test substantiated her claims of\nCherokee and Delaware heritage well I don't think that one out of one thousand and twenty four\nWhich I mean there's a infinitesimal percentage we talked about that the other night and her announcement of the results angered many Native Americans including the Cherokee Nation the largest of the country's three federally recognized tribe be tribes\nDNA testing cannot show that these weren't as Cherokee or any other tried to secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation Chuck ... said in a statement tribes set their own citizenship requirements not to mention the DNA tests don't distinguish among see numerous indigenous groups of\nNorth and South America the test ms Warren took did not identify Cherokee incest ... specifically\nIt found that she most likely head at least one\nNative American ancestry six to ten generations ago now we learned earlier this week that\nThe average American the average American of European descent who has been here for\nSome time probably has more Indian Native American heritage that Elizabeth Warren now the article by Ross do that um sounded a similar a point\nAnd he starts a lot of smart people believe Elizabeth Warren the senator from Massachusetts is the front runner for the Democratic nomination and twenty twenty\nOr we said New York magazine profile claim she's winning the invisible prime rebuilding campaign networks rolling out policy proposal brewing insiders intimidating rivals which he released a biographical videos featuring her Oklahoma and roots and answering Donald Trump's Pocahontas jibe with a DNA test proving that she does have\nNative American ancestry I don't think you get really call it native I mean it's like one out of one thousand and twenty four up with six to ten generations\nAgo Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg View called the video the latest in a series of solid moves Warren has been making to persuade democratic leaders she can take on Trump\nNow the columnist says I Am not meaning he is not a democratic insider oh campaign professional so for all I Know Warren may indeed be impressing her intended audience\nAnd I can certainly think a worst people for the Democratic party to nominate that a woman who has white working class roots as well as academic credentials and a half buried past ... had a real docks intellectual\nGo read my book the two income trap seriously have no idea what he means by that but running for president in the age of Donald Trump requires above all inability to hear what John\nHeilemann and mark helping once called the freak show back when he was considerably less freaky that requires a deafness dealing with scandals and gas an accidental blunders inability to know when you have a wrestling move that justifies getting done in the mud and when you're better off sitting on a top rail enacting superior to the ...\nSo when Warren's main encounter with the freak show has evolved who claimed Cherokee ancestry which was an issue and her last Senate campaign in two thousand twelve before Trump started\nIn with his nickname and from her initial response to the story through her new DNA test for bottles with the president she has demonstrated a conspicuous lack of political commonsense and again this is coming from someone who is I'm\nA ... a Republican functionality so my question is this\nPretty simple everybody knows what happened that I'm Elizabeth Warren's sat on this\nQuestion on this dilemma for five and a half years the most that we could ever get out of her or when we asked her and the reporters in Boston asked her about proof of her ancestry back in two thousand twelve with this\nOne was in Brooklyn restaurant a cop or more Wall Street performance when she was asked again are you part Indian\nMy mother\n[noise] if there was a more way if there was it the more ... sending condescending manner in which to deliver an answer I think if you looked up the word condescending or in the dictionary that would be a picture of Elizabeth Warren anyway my question is real simple\nUh and I know it's one that many of you probably have thought about and that is did this um series of reports in the Boston Globe in her release of these D. N. A. results as self serving as I think she thought they were had they backfired\nAh and if so to what extent in your opinion is she in any danger of losing to Jeff deal and in your opinion has she so antagonized in irritated people within the Democratic party\nDid she in doing this three weeks before the midterms and there have been democratic political leaders who have criticized her has she in effect sunk her own ship before it was Chris in with a bottle her ... her own ship called the twenty twenty before was\nChristian with a bottle of champagne here the number six one seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty I Want to talk to about this I Hope you do as well with coming right back to the night side [noise]\nNice side with Dan re news watch never stops W.

Dan White and Harvey Milk were elected in Nineteen Seventy seven there were sort of like a new wave a politician in San Francisco\nUh over the years there has been a I'm a almost a caricature portrayed both white in milk\nWhere we're milk kind of comes into the book uh aside from the fact that obviously these two assassinations happen these two events happen so close to another is that he was a supporter of Jim Jones a lot of people don't realize that\nThat a lot of the folks in San Francisco and even nationally I'm Jim Jones was not some fringe figure he was not um you know like a Charles Manson street person type guy\nHe was someone that was very much in the in crowd so much so that the mayor of San Francisco George Moscone appointed him or to the housing commission San Francisco and he quickly became with my ... what's going to support\nThe chairman of the housing commission in San Francisco which is pretty scary thought when you think of how he treated his tenants than in Johnstown that this guy's essentially the largest landlord and the city of San Francisco you don't see that with other people\nA ... you know whose names are set in the same breath people like Ted Bundy or Charles Manson\nThis guy was very much I'm In the establishment in San Francisco and it says something about that city in that decade it was sort of the hangover after the high you know you had the summer of love have asked for Haight Ashbury all that stuff that was going in the Nineteen sixties and that was a whole lot of fun and all of a sudden you have the hangover and it's not so much fun\nYou have the seventies Liberation Army and the kidnapping of Patty Hearst\nYou have this group called the new world Liberation Front that is putting bombs they put a bomb on the on the window sill of Dianne Feinstein\nThey would send candy to different office holders and they'd be bombs and and the ... you know Russell Stover candy box ah there were um weatherman hiding out there was obviously I'm the zodiac killer the zebra killings there's all sorts of craziness going on in the Nineteen sixties and into this issue comes people's temple\nAnd want to do things you forgot they were two presidential assassination attempts on Gerald Ford a\nBite was it Sarah Jane more where I wanted and that was the one in San Francisco right and then there was one Sacramento by squeaky fries review from which Sacramento is not that far from Jordan Cisco northern\nCalifornia I'm so it was a wild wild time and of course San Francisco still has a men's problems but what I Want to come back to his the central figure a Jim Jones who eventually would lead was it three hundred or more\nThis is nine hundred and Eighteen people that were killed including Jones\nIncluding Jones it was a mass suicide and these were people who were poor um who had a basically given everything everything to this guy who portrayed himself as a messiah\nAre and who people believed it it's an amazing story it's an amazing book called city Jim Jones Harvey Milk and ten days that shook San Francisco I did not recall that the assassinations followed so closely on the Johnstown\nMassacre shore that was that was nine days later\nAnd um I think history you know the the history that's told us that Dan White killed Harvey Milk 'cause he was gay and I got a very close Harvey Milk was guy because our milk was gay I got a much more complicated version told to me one of the guys I spoke to was the end whites campaign manager chief of staff\nAnd a business partner he's ... he's gay and\nWe're going to get to all

Harvey Milk and others tried to stop the ... the article from from being published and it was stopped for a while but finally it comes out and at that point I'm a ... on mass hundreds of people's temple members go to San Francisco airport in the summer Nineteen Seventy seven and they go down to Guyana\nTo this um jungle community which they had set up three or four years earlier and um\nYou know this was in the middle of jungle ... British guy on insurance and I remember back in the day there was British and French ... well this is now yeah this this British guy anti but it's at that point it is a guy on and then you have an independent\nUm it's run by a guy named Forbes Burnham who's a Marxist and so that's part of the law for them but the other part of lawyers they are a hundred miles away from Georgetown the capital and so you can pretty much do whatever he wants\nAnd so they go there um and they sleep because they're afraid you know just a ... a few years earlier they were accused of rigging the elections in Nineteen Seventy five for for mayor of San Francisco\nThey do the investigation and San Francisco who's in charge of the investigation Jim Jones a second in command he's in the da's office [laughter] a threat so that's how much they had their hooks in the city but the world was falling apart you can only hold that together for so long and so they they ... they scramble down\nTo Diana and\nIn speaking to people who are down there a lot of them described it as rather idyllic before Jim Jones got down there but once he got down there literally for six hours a day he had these loudspeaker ... that everyone was hearing and it was just all that you were hearing was Jim Jones\nA you know who ... who ... who plays for the airplanes head of the ... well they had money like you know we talked about before they they have people who are signing their houses they were signing a checks they really didn't get to keep their own money they may have had a couple of bucks spending every week they were living community you know maybe Seventeen people in an apartment or something like that and at times in San Francisco\nAnd the rents were a little cheaper back then um but they they um they had millions of dollars and in fact in the very end they give three million dollars to they let three people go and they said take this money to the Soviet embassy and give it to the Soviet\nUnion so [laughter] they so they didn't do that I Hope they kept if they drop the money 'cause it was so heavy [laughter] it was literally they literally dropped the money walking on a I'm On a railroad track and said this is put throw this down the sisters India is Indiana yeah okay so so they get to China\nOr in all of a sudden I'm the investigation pursues them a congressman Leo Ryan uh within I think he brings one or two kids he also brings a um a an NBC reporter\nHe brings a number of reporters go down there with him John Harris John Harris was one of them um and they want it to go in and talk to Jones and on the night of November seventeenth everything was fine um it seemed fine on the surface\nAnd at a certain point this man that I interviewed Vern ...\nGive us a note to um to John Harris because he thinks Don Harris says the congressman cars don't Harris's looks more like a congressman to Leo Ryan and yeah and and so John Harris doesn't notice and then he looks at it and some little kids niches on him and from that point on things got very dark very quickly and jumps down\nNow dawn Harris was the NBC reporter who was working out of the Dallas office the Dallas NBC bureau and the reason I Know that is I was working with John Harris is camera guy that day that very day in Dallas\nUh we had gone to I have gone down a to do a Fifteen year anniversary of the assassination of

Would have to kind of disagree with that I don't care to people [noise]\n... I think they were brainwash they were isolated and the killing of the congressman set up such paranoia and also they purposely killed several people to Congress one another so that they knew that this would be there and that they let them go\nBut maybe the people would have survived but one thing that kills congressmen and the other is a\n...
