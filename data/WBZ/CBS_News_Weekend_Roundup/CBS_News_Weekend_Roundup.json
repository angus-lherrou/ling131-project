to your um speech on the air when you speak about not remaining ... at the station and you actually push her care back and blocked off the fat [laughter]\nI'm curious what was going on at that time and what happened since then and what are your views on on that whole time when Roger tied though to defeat after he left well\nRoger been picked to replace Len Burman and um most\nPeople in the town of that time felt the job should have been mine I'd worked it'd be easy for eight years and I work from the bottom as a producer in radio to being on the air and radio to having a number one ranked number one rated radio show to the TV a good number a record setting numbers in TV and when the time came to be promoted it didn't happen\nNow I could tell most people in the people that I've that that are closest to me they know that I almost went to a mental breakdown\nOver that and I and I and and it was the one the most difficult periods of my life my late godmother ... was the first person to call me and tell me that I'm ... now see was leaving\nAnd she says well this must be great it's your chance that you're going to be the first you know five day week anchor when sports\nI'm ... and I just told her no I don't think that's going to be because I was with a friend of mine at that time a friend of mine who was dying in fact I was a Boeing volunteer work at the hospital and I was with um [noise]\nI was with him when she found me because they weren't cell phones then but she found me so I said you should call the station right away it was a there has to be something in this for you and I said no I can tell you right now\nIt's not me it's not my term or whatever and um it was a lot of consternation around that decision by side with the general manager because we had these meetings at the time uh it'd be they will call sensitivity meetings for African Americans and white management and so forth these meeting\nThey were very heated and ... very much was discuss I Would not go because I knew\nThat there were even black people it'd be the some who may have like me or didn't like me they were they were distressed over the fact that I worked at heart and didn't get the promotion and um it was painful it was very very painful I didn't want to work there anymore in fact I wanted to quit right then\nMeals thing ... was a writer\nAnd he came and did an article with me and I just let him have it and he called me before the articles printed the Jimmy look a this could really hurt you and so forth that said Neal I'll be honest with you I really need to talk to this management so they can try to understand what's going on in my mind\nI all my life I've had to know what\nThese people think maybe they need to know what I think that I worked for this and I worked hard for this and Len Burman and I are not friends we did not get along and they had a lot of mess from him and when he decides to jump a contracting leave or get fired whichever way it happened he tried to renegotiate contracts long story short was I\nBelieve that the job should have been mine\nAnd I spoke out and I had many people within the black community came to me and said man you should keep your mouth close you are lucky to have a job and said no no\nI said if we don't learn to stand up\nFor ourselves who's going to stand up for them and\nYou're not taught I discuss with my mom and my dad and both of them were ill at the time and they said son [noise] this is one where you just going to have to make a decision and you're going to have to stand with so\nI came to the end of the contract and we had a black news director at the time by the name of Don Ross has a clear this is in my head that you brought it up\nAnd down Ross asked me um well he more or less uh called me into his office and they just let ... Lewis go in August my\nContract was up in no let him go on July my contract was up in August and we were both leaving and we would have to weaken anchors and we had the highest numbers in the city at the time\nAnd there was gonna be a major mess regarding both black guys leaving and so Don I was in his office and the man actually broke down in tears and started clients that you can't leave you can't leave it will cost and my job or whatever whatever whatever I'm telling this did this audience so they understand just some of the things that will be in my book one day\nBut I sat there with him and I tried to explain them I don't want to be here anymore this is not a place that\nI'm interested in and it's so ironic that you know when ... got the job as a five day week female anger in this town I'll never mid eighties\nAverage really like it has in Seventy seven right right and I just told Liz I told his story two at a banquet for Marvin Hagler one night and she could not believe it she says oh so you're the reason you're the reason I got here\nSay because these people when I first walked through this door they said ... please just don't just there'll be Jimmy Myers and you'll be fine\nAnd I don't mean to rush or go\nAhead do get roughly forty seconds how long\nDo you think the fact that it almost forty years later there is no black anchor on the news stations and often can you explain that to me\nNo you mean news anchors you know there are no I think there's one or two steep Burton does sports a channel for yeah for five days a week okay no not of the major stations that I Know they're all white again we will channel surfing as a black female anchor\nAnchor five days a week five days a week well that that was out there already rising\nBank Morgan I'll finish that story on the other side of fairness and try to call your welcome ordinary\nOr go to Chris and river taker news at the top three hour which is just five six seconds away from the news we do you mean mercenary we'll be back\nJoined the W. busy street team Tuesday a cobra sixty from five to seven PMS winner's circle in Salisbury\nSteak for dinner and enjoy great monitor games from the Massachusetts state lottery celebrate ... twenty fifth anniversary Dilbert twentieth\nPlaying you know bonus for a greater chance to multiply your prime laying Keno bonus can multiply your prize two three four five or ten times for more information visit mass lottery dot com must be Eighteen years or older to play we play responsibly\nW Veasey buses WXXI K.
