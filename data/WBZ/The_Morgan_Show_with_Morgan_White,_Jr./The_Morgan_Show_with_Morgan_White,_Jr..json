friends who are listening to and I was flying in ... were a will for his frog bans I guess starting about Nineteen sixty five\nOr six get six to six start getting into bans are still under at Brooklyn high school um\nAnd I was in a band that was trying to play some some booze or\nLate in Nineteen sixty six words some fine musicians from uh the book line area and then I was in a band that was kind of kind of played a little bit of everything was called the free board and very creative musicians who are in that that\nBan that they really are taught me to have\nA open minded\nOpen ears about music\nSounds like they've got a little sector deli in the band with a name like that Bob\nA man she ah\n[laughter] I Do remember [laughter] I Do yes I Do a\nNow are there any idea those guys still

particular ban uh there's um\nI didn't lose ... for a while\nUh no they were that they knew each other or get or from that same generation and both a blade in Chicago\nI thought I looked around here at one point or another during that period of time at all I Know I did I thought it was with James but obviously I was mistaken I'm Sorry continue\n... that that is another story that I that that that actually goes into this\nOne real real well while I was a plane was Luther\nAt a place a under the tracks and rocks recalled behind one tap had really blues\nEvery night in there and we would be a success tonight or six days a week or three set matinee on Sunday that's thirty nine set sets for those of mathematically inclined\nThirty nine and a week week and a dental hone your chops huh\nAnd since she said and can make eighty dollars a week doing it I put my day job\n[laughter] uh it's a great blue story ah\nIn in highland tap a one time I got very excited because I saw this guy walks into a bar and ah we sat down there in order to bunch drinks for himself and shot glasses and drank a better was James Caan\nA cotton had played a a a a\nConcert with his band which was pretty well known by that time\nModerate probably a in Cambridge or something and then he came over a tour Luther was playing hung out for a while and uh\nHe um well when he ... he came up and sad and then he just blew the roof off the joy\nUh I don't know how it got so crowded and so fast because people didn't have cell phones but just somehow that place got really full of people and ... driving everybody crazy\nA fabulous and listen to us and\nListen to his band a\nAnd he and his guitar\nPlayers so and he started doing his own songs or me and the other the job player on the band ... mark ... and of course lose or to uh we we knew how to play style of music but at the end of the night\nGot nationally from my phone number and I was just floored\nAnd he just laughed and said well you never know\nAnd it was the first night\nThat I realized that I couldn't possibly\nPlay in the band or somebody that we actually legendary is the first time I ever thought about anything like\nThat at that point you and you figure it out I I might be able to play in the major leagues so\nUh yeah that that's a good way to put a\nA and it was a thrill\nAnd I'm a ... a year and a half later I went to see a muddy at a uh a all small in Boston sure I'd seen him quite a few times or the jazz workshop\nAnd Paul small was bigger bigger ruin the Fred Taylor who's still around Boston are all owned the place and he really brought amazing music to their\nI spend a lot of time in the middle of the rooms Bob I Know it well and you're right\nBoy he brought in all kinds of people there huh man\nYeah one one night when I was playing with Marty ... a year or two later a Wal Mart he was in Paul's small Bob Marley said the jazz workshop\nMercy yeah that that was the kind of great things that used to happen from one room to the other they're so so money was playing at Paul small\nAnd I uh\nI was ... he was my favorite musician and I met him because losers band and sad and like done I guess set with them one time I think a pall mall and a\nBand called the Boston blues band that I was not that people from the Boston area and ... and ... grade harmonica player named ... ... oh yeah\nUh we we had a open shows from ... and\nHe saw that I was trying to play what he called those schools Chicago blues and it was very nice to me about it which was a thrill because that was\nKnow the person that army that he was the\nMost musically influential person that was my favorite and uh so um I made it my business to be down\nThere very very early on the first night or that's engaged and uh they they used to do five or six I'd say well you usually six nights in a club\nAnd move on to another city and play and other such large when people come out every night you know\nI ...

Louis lips and\nWho are known since we were in the second grade together on our member only started taking lessons in fourth grade but he was only a little bit ... uh but uh he was very street wise and I were a lot about music like St Louis lives so now I have a cat that's named after him\nYou know that's an honor you we we we take\nGreat pride in what we name our pets and after whom and why so I'm I'm going to ask you one of the dumb questions because I I guess it's it's required\nThe me to do this [noise] what is it about the blues that makes it so special and unique and\nUm how long lasting ... and ... around I don't think it's going to go anywhere anytime soon what is it about the music that just gets on the people's skin I won't let it go\n\nIt does speak to the common human condition beyond a beyond race and beyond age and be on the musical tastes\nAre we all have blues of feeling in our heart sometimes and lose music expresses it very directly the people that love that kind of music keep it alive even though it's uh\nNot the most commercial music in the world and um\nBut I feel it really brings all kinds of people together the song that I wrote mercy that's on my\nAlbum is about the gaps between people and now there are glowing these days [noise] romantically politically socially economically and its blues about that situation it was a thrill for me to um\nThis last summer ... go to vote to Russia and Ukraine on separate trips and to be able to play those songs for a Russian and the Ukrainian ...\nWow and I'm In awe of\nWell that it was we deem and for me I Hope it was redeeming for some of them and um I think that a music can be a real force for good in the world in a\nProfession that I'm On reserve ugly proud of I think it's a good thing to do for people it's makes them feel good\nEven even a sad song helps people release their own sadness\nSo when you were over the plane to the Russian Ukrainian audience I ... I had this is going to sound awkward did they get it I mean did did the blues come across to them as well because it's not a music that they would normally be exposed to but a lot of times it doesn't matter for every reasons you mentioned\nAh they ah\nThey're they're a blues fans over there and people that here for the first time that just love it and some of them are\nAlready very scholarly with it no more about the history a of the music on most of the musicians to a a a meat and\nAnd some people over there cutting can play it very well uh I I did a go go to rush a few times to play with the band called ladder mayor loosen up from the jumping cats\nAround me over there and play as well and twenties Seventeen and twenty Eighteen and I had a wonderful time colluding with the ladder man\nWhat a great name for a ban oh my goodness gracious\n... and so that leads me to the question now about what is it about Boston and it seems to have a a a thriving blue scene and all and has had for a lot of usa thriving blue seen all out of proportion from what you would expect from a city like Boston\nOr be the balloon seem to appreciate music up there and I remember the the club scene in the sixties and seventies and and the eighties I used to play at a place called the famine broke lying in the eighties oh yeah no it will\nBe on beacon street\nAnd um there's I mean there are plenty of cities that have a special musical character I don't think Boston has any one kind of music that that defines a there is not not like Boston booze sound or anything but many great musicians came out\nOf that area and ah I I really love the place and I will be back again for these days with Tyler\nMars and back yet again with one of my favorite musicians who still lives in the area even though I Believe is from Detroit originally James Montgomery\nAnd we'll be doing a tribute to James Caan with a lot of great our players are at a than arrows in a foul river\nRiver and Fall River ...\nThat that that will be I Believe to I think it's December so December six\nAnd I've had ... and Jimmy on with me a couple of times it's always great to have him on two for well for the same reasons you mentioned ah he he had\nHe had one of the best descriptions of guitarist that I Know of a he was that I won't go into specific names but this is a number of years ago he was ... when I was working as a as an ink stained wretch not not as or not whether it was his army and the radio a\nBob but he was a ... couple of guitar it's pretty well know guys and I bumped into him a few months later and neither of them in the band\nAnd I and I kind of said well what happened in this is so typical of James he said well he said one was crazy and we knew it and the other was crazy and we didn't know it [laughter]\nPerfect\nYeah that is that is a a funny story\nWell he's been around than any man task stick musician R I remember in about Nineteen Seventy one going to a club called is are caught in the summer of ... which was owned by\nJoe ... for a little later I'm at Joe's Joe's plays also in summer or a ... a\nJames ... and his band would ah Larry cars\nWent on guitar and Tom prints bottle on good jar or in there just ripping a place to to pieces\nAnd they had a book club was full of people and they were probably making a thousand dollars at night\nWhich is actually decent money for a I'm a blues band now and I'm good money then about ...

new stories see other kinds of news stories the fun ones the goofy ones the dumb ones as I say I always time of the Web so you don't have to waste as much time on the Web and then after three three o'clock hour we're going to move into a topic where I'm looking forward\nTo engaging with you the savvy WB Z listen there I think you're going to enjoy that topic and I and in a safe until after three o'clock hour but it's something I think that will certainly\nCertainly\nA arouse your curiosity and get you involved but I mean time a few stories here and there ... you get all of this sometimes you just can't be real life\nUh here's the story of this sounds like something straight out of a goofy military comedy but it's real a Belgian technician accidently set off the canon of a military plane dream maintenance which shot another plane in that play and blow up damaging the initial playing in the process\nTalk about a bad day wow\nAnd you think you had a bad day at the office I just hope they don't feel him for the damages because well I as he bordered by aviation twenty four the events took place at the floor an airbase in October eleventh a bunch of planes are being service some hitting offer a training mission\nThat technician in one of the F. sixteens accidentally hit the big red button activated six barrel Vulcan M. sixteen cannon six barrels we're not fooling around when you get that button\nPresumably before he even had time to other oh no another F. sixteen had burst into flames [laughter] oh boy they just wanted recently been fueled for a training run and yes the bullets hit the gas tank groups\n[noise] what's the old line from that old ... the terrific comedy series a second city TV that\nHe blew up good he blew up ... good they're sixteen filled with gas hit with a lot of bullets were Balkan Kennan boom\nThe article goes on to say and because the world is cruel to blast from the exploding F. sixteen also impact of the plane that delivered the shots\n\nAre unfortunately a couple of technicians were injured during the blast as well but it doesn't seem to have been serious injuries thankfully\n[noise] uh the Belgian aviation safety director it as open investigation and see what exactly they can do to make sure something like this doesn't possibly happen again I'm guessing no matter what they try and say and do or even if they do nothing something like that he's never going to happen again anyway [laughter]\nSo technician accidentally sets off again and again that's sixteen and then blows up another F. sixteen and damages the original a plane in the process\nI'm thinking [noise] several million dollar price tag in damages ah right now the story that they came across my desk regarding all of us with our pets [noise]\nYou know there's not enough pressure on us and the day to day basis as it is we have to start considering these things as well [noise] ah dogs might get depressed when owners overuse smartphones according to a new study so dogs may become more anxious and possibly suffer from depression when their owners overuse their smartphones\nA recent study focused on how welcoming a pet specifically a dog could help people suffering from suffering for mental health issues in the leg but researchers also learn that dogs may suffer from depression when they're human handlers ignore them\nTalk to pressure so that does that mean we have now dog medicine for ... depression it's ... there's just no end of the stuff\nOf Philadelphia vet said he's seeing the effects of smartphone users junk pets dogs are very good at reading are subtle cues\nHere's a call from that vet dogs do read body language they read our eye contact the read our facial expressions so we're on the phone and acting just interested in looking for attention it basically is ignoring your dog and the dog ends up getting depressed\nAnd you know what else also really gets the dog depressed\nNot only when people are on their cell phones but when they take the cell phone and said what Lucia good boy who's a good boy that's a long way to go for cheap joke machines that the the bottom line is on that is true of\nOur dogs could possibly get depressed if we ignore them and spend too much time on the phone\nA couple more things before it gets top of the hour and this one actually has has a local angle I've actually been been following the

reign on ...\nJudgments when you're sitting in for ... for this edition of night side on WB Z\nComing up on the midnight hour we've got about eight nine minutes left with our guest Ryan Maloney and Randall bird the co host of the podcast it's the liquor talking there's so much to glean from this in terms of an historical perspective in terms of a business opportunity in terms of being a better informed educated consumer\nAre you guys have talked to me before about blending your own barrels where you go and visit distilled or whatever type of liquor and say I want a little bit of this and a little bit of that in Egypt overtime and come up with something new well you know there's the thing was we really started\nStarted a that was one of the trans was picking your own barrel\nAnd we started actually got in on that right at the ground level take take it back a step so picking a barrel in general would mean what we would go down to do you go down to this jewelry\nWe would actually go through the warehouse would actually drill into barrels we are and and they say hey we've I like this one case it's you know it's like when you want a ... a barrel now he's on the restaurant and you see that the lobsters and go I Want that one side of the same thing and they would they would do is they would take that barrel down they would bottle it up for us they put a label indicating that we picked it\nAnd they ship it to the store and we would sell it as our barrel ... so it's usually a little bit off\nA of what the ordinary a whiskey that was available at the time 'cause usually those were batches this was a single barrel whenever we could we get it on ... filter will get his cash strength\nWhenever we cut now you go into a lot of liquor stores now you'll see single barrels you'll see people doing is usually who's doing the barrel is one did now you can get the stellar mass and just sort of self will pick a battle food for you\nOr or it's the manager this was his first barrel ... so we we used to have been started on this for a\nWhile back that up just a little bit at a time when people weren't buying whiskey distilleries were happy to sell you a whole barrel\nBecause normally a liquor store might move to cases a year but when you buy the whole barrel you're moving dozens of cases not forty what happening in time as whiskey increased and being very popular and very much of a trend or a fad\nEverybody started trying to have their own barrel so we kinda got in probably the ground floor\nNow there are a lot of people picking it and so the question is how can we continue to innovate and the space that has now become crowded with every store happy to have their own barrel so that they could say they have their own barrel we think we do a pretty good job at it a lot of magazines and people that write and read it highly rated a review our stuff very highly\nBut we just recently did a project in Maryland where we were doing marriage of barrels and this is a concept where you do a microbe after a small batch of barrels\nThat you are combining together uh in order to make not just a single barrel but a few barrels credit fuse together that that's what you're going to put on your\nShow so we're the only for a very specific taste that he wanted to achieve\nSo with sagging we did it down in Maryland with sagging more spirits we did a rabbi and basically we took two barrels\nAnd mix them together to get to a certain way we wanted that to taste did another two barrels of mixed that together so that's ... how combined into two giant barrels and now we put those two together so for barrels to two barrels to one batch\nAnd what we did with sagging more spirits are in the rye was we were able to get that spicy ... front where they finished that was more of a almost like a bourbon or ... or you get started out as the sweet ... side of flavors those banality tones\nSmooth it all out so we were actually able to achieve that\nBy playing with with inside the distillery and playing with ... with these battles to come up with this product and sagging more spirits has got this really cool thing because what they're trying to do and mentally could probably explain it better than I can they're trying to take back the category of ride to Maryland right rye\nCapital of the United states was Maryland that got lost over time and a lot of people just assume that Kentucky makes all the great spirits\nAnd they also lost a lot of horse racing and I think that they're tried to combine those two ah to bring back the pedigree or the heritage of Maryland dry and horse racing they're making a great products\nWhat we wanted to do is we love your great products but how can we\nPut our own unique twist on it and see where we can take it and I think the response from the distillery was like hey can you kind of come down and fork with us on some more projects so that's really exciting for us to do but again the proof is in in whether you like it or not I mean we were talking about how great we are picking this stuff\nBut if they are and you as the consumer or Josh if you're facing this and you say that stuff for me\nThen that really is not\nYou know what matters what matters is your experience or connection\nTo that and and your personal reaction to whatever it is that your body how much you left and right and what's the what's really cool about a sagging more in what I like about what they're doing they're and they're one of the few places that can do it right 'cause they have they took a lot of money and I said make a little money\nThey actually are sourcing the ride that they're doing right now but they have it from a empty pie which is in Indiana some power house he was a story and but what they're doing is they have\nA one mashed bill that's coming from there and then they've worked with them and actually made in the ... we do with the brief\nTime we've got here that they just want to ask you both quicker than ... seconds each the biggest trends thinks people should be looking for are the biggest misnomer about later but it's\nI think the biggest thing you should be looking for is transparency you should know where your product coming from you should know be able to find out as much about the product if somebody's telling you a story they should be able to back it up\nAnd I think that it should be getting off of age statements that's the thing that the that came up in the nineties but bottles of whiskey and spirits that don't have a statement that not mean that they are not going to be good tasting they've gotten so much better at the barrel management and ...\n... it's always a pleasure I always learn so much when I talk to you both both from a historical side from the from an

New Hampshire forty four and took spring again fifty degrees in downtown Boston again the name of the documentaries\nOn from the heart is about the life of the late great blues man Paul Butterfield than I Am a stone cold Paul Butterfield fans and it's been a treat to be able to talk to a director and producer John Anderson about\nJohn before the break we we talked about the the Bill Graham quote about if it wasn't for ... a lot of us wouldn't be here today so as we talk about someone who's\nImpacting influenced far exceeded perhaps their record sales\nAnd a a general recognition Paul certainly falls in that category because you can make a case of the whole San Francisco seen the airplane the dead all these other people were so enormously influence when Butterfield came out with Bloomfield doing these ... and you know these round rock songs and the like\nSo his influence really goes far beyond where people expect don't you think\nIt's true and you know you mentioned San Francisco especially it was so true there because when I first got there and sixty five [noise] everybody was there to see any creative station in Chicago so the airplane was there the dead was there [noise] um\nAnd the universal feeling that all these issues issues had was hey man we better get serious about our instruments because these guys can really play and it brought up the level of musicians ship in San Francisco significantly and all over the country\nAnd as we say whether it's the Grateful Dead are so many the bands that came out of San Francisco there's been a great ripple effect here uh I got a chance to talk to them because I was a\nA music writer for a lotta years John I got a chance to talk to them a couple of times uh in one of the things that I remember and it's very interesting because it ties in very closely with the time of the documentary is\nIt is saying that the armonica was perhaps the most personal instrument because it was the one you held closest to you he was the instrument that you held look closest to your body and horn from the heart very much ties in with that doesn't it\nWhere we're having a conversation with John Anderson is the director and producer for the documentary horn from the heart\nYour documentary about the life of the the late great blues man Paul Butterfield are generally been airing it around the country so you've already gotten some feedback in response to what the sort of feedback have you gotten a I'm intrigued if you've gotten feedback from musicians as well\n[noise]\nWell it it had its opening week long run at the ... percent of New York city last week\nA bill for the jazz musician was there a hugely great things to say about this bill you know showed up with Gary Lucas guitarists would be hard and many others\nOverwhelmed with the New York times gave it a critics pick which has really boosted his profile Rolling Stone a beautiful article about it and yesterday the wall Street Journal published it very favorable reduce so thanks to those things were adding three or four hours a day to the schedule\nEvery once in awhile things pop up about Paul and they almost disappear without a trace it always infuriates me or was it last year that\nThey released the album live at the unicorn and it was an album that seemed to did just disappeared without a trace I don't think I read a single review of it\nAnd yeah they're recording qualities so so not great but you know not as bad as a lot of the ... recordings from that era when we're done when people didn't expect to be released\nAnd you have a remarkable especially with the term remarkable playing on it again and nothing no nose and it just infuriates me is I I really\nHope that the the documentary goes a long way towards towards writing that wrong\nA thank you so much great music for people to catch up on your right\nUh I Know I Will already it's it I mean this is just greedy now maybe almost unfair to ask is are you are you looking at the next project\nA course of course a lot of [noise]\nI Do a lot of music docks I work with Brian Wilson him do his work and I've got a couple of Roger which at that and for over Twenty years which is Tiny Tim\nOh my goodness gracious well you know what a a a a\nCultural figure when in you know in his prime that you've got as much attention as anyone else did in a fascinating figure so why not but a\nLot of people that get them as a free flu can I guess he was all those things but it was also\nA music colleges tea also had a beautiful voice of course the shuttle was a gimmick but encyclopedic knowledge of American music and everybody loved him you know the band back them up and you are when you eat\nA loved him and there's a great story entails going out to his house will sixty seven to me down so it's a New Yorker story and that's what it means a lot to me\nDealing in Tiny Tim the mind just boggles at the possibility I Wonder which one seemed weird or to the other John\n[laughter] tiny always a lot of that guy I guess so but that might have been a close second under those circumstances at that time or you\nKnow\nI was just going to talk about now you've done a couple of other documentaries on on the blues blue seeing you did something on on sample a of course who played with Butterfield and there's a veteran Chicago blues man a or what made you dedicate so much of your time is a a documentary artist on the blue scene in Chicago\nIt's just always good to me you know I came here to go to college many years ago immersed in the blue said at a tape recorder recorded a bunch of shows got to know the characters from our perspective that makes sense at all came from the blues but\nYou know now I just can't get away from it there's so many great artists and you know so much ... lotion to be lined in those old records and and talking to those\nArtists and you know I feel like I'm lucky to be in the right time of the right place to be able to talk to them while they're still around to contribute to sell\nYa you you've got to a a definite period of time to get this all done because there aren't a lot of art is left to connect to the classic blues generation with the current one\nSo that people like as you said Nick hurled and bishop to talk to me and those are the guys who were there for a lot of that Steve Miller as well um yeah I Know that that window is closing so\nIf this has already happened forgive me because it must have happened recently 'cause I always check all the time that he will he has family in blues land that the album finally been released on CD yet the one that has Bloomfield all over\nI Do think that is still available again on CD huh no it's a travesty\nHot it is a ... this is this is the stuff that just kills me this is the stuff that that man oh man I\nTell her just today that it's going to be honest\nOh fabulous with really\nGood we will be so now you know maybe that will be in the world needs to get that record because it is so good\nAs we're talking about Butterfield all the things you did you mentioned it being at the last walls of course and doing what mystery train but I'm Talking with Bob marvel and Butterfield also backed Muddy Waters in that performance that just made everyone drop their jaws\nA Margot and was taken great delight and talking about you know Clapton Robby Robin sending all these guys would just ... when money came out and do this thing and part of it was fall back again\nAnd I'm One of the things that Margot and said last night that I pass along John as he said that money often said that he liked the way that Paul played that song that warble behind my voice it was a chord behind my voice and helped hold up my voice\nYeah you're talking to manage blue yeah just chemistry\nYou know do all those all the way at the end of the stage there you know he feels comfortable and they've been friends for years at that point so there was a lot of you know a lot of love going on between them besides just the great news\nI thought that was just interesting you said I Love the way he plays they have something that warm all behind my voice that poured behind my singing it helps a lot of my voice will\nMatter as long as he was playing with somebody had to do is just to and suddenly the group was better suddenly everybody was playing together and that was the magic is energy\nWe haven't talked to John Anderson is the director and producer for the documentary horn from my heart I I'm Sorry I heard from my heart that I got that correct right\n\nFrom the heart I knew I messed it up sergeant horn from the heart which is a documentary on the great blues band Paul Butterfield a spectacular player and performer so if you're into the blues into pop user gr into will make documentaries and I'll check it out it is going to be coming to the region theater on November fifteenth\nAnd there'll be a question and answer session after that the few minutes we have left John thanks for being so generous with your time if you were going to put together your own personal best of Paul Butterfield what would you put on it\n[laughter] I tell you that let me tell people that if they want to keep track of the film let you go from dot com when you've got to start was born in Chicago activists\nNo no no it's ... how could you how could you leave that out\n[laughter] again everything\nThat shit I wouldn't take off of that record screaming also burning Butterfield Bloomfield instrumental\nAlso take from Los Angeles so you can hear what Paul is like as an ensemble because of course I'm way takes the lead on that then you got to go to record the boundaries and not only duration of songs you know was\nThirteen minutes or something and came out sixty six so you know it was probably sixty eight\n\nJust displays wide ranging imagination down then you go into the orange section a glove in my own dream you know not only and again it goes on a day just David shout along so beautifully and also Paul shows\nHis excellent guitar playing on that\nShow John I hate to do this we get about thirty seconds left I Want to make sure you get to talk about um websites Twitter whatever you want people to know\nHorn for the heart dot com Twitter Facebook were there\nIf you are listening to this film was scheduled at a theater near you tell them you want them to be on you want it to be on their schedule on the website that you don't then because this this building from the ground up\nJohn thanks very much for being with us we'll have to do this again soon talk to you soon\nExtreme of I\nThink even though his health is now and what I'm Talking contractors known for building beautiful home was uncompromising every Saturday Night in ... and here's your wisdom on building renovations and might be part of the conversation that you find in the comments\nHad high hard media dot com one seven Seventy seven Seventy one twenty times has any time I mean I Know there may be dumped them\n\nW visa ... WXXI ... two men and I heard radio station\nSo somebody read the entire thing about books well that's pretty interesting if he got through the whole thing there's something there you know so that was something I had set it off to the side while I was working on the the whole grand history project and so\nAll of the books that you've read that are in your library is the nonfiction books right our I'll get that many reviews ... or something\nAnd if I buy a new book and I'm I'm a page twenty five I Can't I Can't write a review I got to wait until him at least a third finished with it so how many books or in books\nI don't know exactly a couple of thousand maybe how man\nA but it it's nice it's got the ... and like everything else I publish it's got that nice fourteenth for lunch it's not it's not big enough to be sixteen which makes it technically large font but everybody but everybody says this is great I Love the ...\nIt's a great fought for the general public to very everybody can read it\nThere's very little out there and fourteen oh you're every everything is eleven five twelve which to me I Need my reading glasses this I can read this in the dark\nYou know so that's that's a big selling point for me and the fact that all of the segment so short no matter what I Do no matter what book I'm reading no matter how much I loved the book I don't like long chapters\nBecause it's after that after a\nWhile it just kind of things just kind of get weighed yelling that ... that are littered up into two as you do you like to like that that are already so we have the the book called books and as you said to the best of your knowledge\nAnd I'm just having fun saying this like the best of your knowledge there's never been a book called books I don't believe before that's why they're so\nHere's a new type of format was changed I've got a\nGood for those of you self published you know that creates space was very popular it's disappeared it's been absorbed by Kendall and you have to learn the new system it was a little intimidating I wasn't sure if I could do it you know and it's just okay with it at some point you just have to learn how to do pay\nYou can graft your old or create space books on to Kendall oh you can start all over\nI'm choosing destroyed all over in order to know that all of the books on Kindle or a graduated improved version and just put so the the the new ones are called the United states and the time of and the ... got a nice\nNicer official look to it so the ones that are if you see usa let me go back a second you gave me some books last time and one of them was this little I actually don't even remember the name of it at the top of New Hampshire there was a little republic\nThere was a whole book about it there's a little Republican what happened was a Canada and the United states had a border dispute over this area at the very top of candidates like most country if you want to see a movie go up there with ... so I'm rusty on it because I haven't looked at the book in a couple of months\nBut it was very interesting because it was a no man's land the people that decided why don't we just start our own country and so for about two or three years there was actually\nThis little tiny country the size of a half a county that was almost on the verge of being recognized until ... and then\nFinally was settled in the United states got the territory but it was getting to the point where Canada in the United states was getting worse if we don't settle this this thing might come into existence as a tiny little like the Vatican city the very very top of New Hampshire [laughter]\nWell you know you still see that attitude today because there are ... parts of Vermont for example that people tell you one like anywhere else in the country like the right the ... the ... as they call it\nI I should mention when my ... books when I used to work at the Boston Herald I was near a a desktop where everybody in the paper would put stuff that they had gotten that they didn't want records books pamphlets ... new whatever people might have gotten promotion earlier when I've been to pass along to them at their old\nWhen they decided okay I didn't want this they would just put it on this desktop that happened to be near me so over the years that I was there I I obviously have a Jones for history and I would I Would get all of these books that were books about anything to do with history was the United states or world history\nOr naval history or wartime history the like thinking that some day I was going to have time to read all the books not knowing that of course I'd be accumulating more books over the years\nSo as I was going through my library of everything that myself I don't know when I'm going to get around to reading these if I give them to MIKE SHE might make better use of them than I ever will last time he was here I did I gave them\nA couple of ...\nLife has these little seminal moments that push you in a little direction the the bulk of these books I'm looking at me like you know I got to put a couple up and down the Congo library I'm not going to get it any chance to get to this one\n... I Love all these books but I I how am I going to get to them I have a schedule everyday and then this one was compelling I\nHad to at least so I spent an afternoon with that one about that little republic but here's what changed here's here's how you impacted\nMy schedule my destiny I went back to where I have to put that in I call it plugging in okay read this stuff it's interesting story it's not in any of my other I have to plug in and they have to go to my old manuscripts I Know the year go through okay it's Andrew Jackson's time I have to go in and I have to find where I can put it in\nJackson with time that is what had happened yes it was on jobs thinking like around the time a Washington no no not at all that this\nWas important though because I went back\nMy natural bend is twentieth century [laughter] you know if you give me a bag of books I'm going to read where we'll won World War two Korea Vietnam I'm into your ... so what has happened in ... is the back in the nineteenth century without me wanting to face the facts\nThose books were a little sloppy they weren't they weren't good enough and when I saw\nWhen I went in and they fix that I added that to the Jackson I went you know I have to overhaul this whole chapter you know this is it's good that is good that you pushed me back into this book because now I have to read do I have to redo this whole book you know I I just I see that now\nSo I did I published Andrew Jackson and then I did Martin Van Buren and then I did William Henry Harrison and then I did John ... a long story short I big I've lost my mind I'm not even talking about [laughter]\nI'm doing twelve Fifteen hours a day but I'm fixing all those books and anything from Andrew Jackson to to Woodrow Wilson\nI guarantee you is professionally polished and I couldn't have said that in August when I came in here at the end of August because you've gone I had to go back and said this isn't my natural bend to study this stuff but it has to be done and I started a domino effect\nThat Israel and in the middle of so I was doing the u._s._a. and the time of you know you were saying the time of uh you know poke Taylor film or appears Buchanan then in the middle of the Lincoln thing\nCreate space disappeared and I had to start all over so my first book was the civil war so since the civil war\nThe new to the new author title is Michael Edward Donovan and that's just because I'm sick of typing in on Amazon and just you gotta go nine pages to find my books there's a lot of my ... as a wrestler there's a voiceover guy is actors\n... there's a very popular wrestler is a is there is a famous singer there's all kinds of my ... it's hard to find me\nAs my ... I prefer to be my daughter and believe me I'm not I'm not a micro ... type of guy but that's what I'll be in order to find me on the Internet so I've already found excellent results you type in Michael it would not have it on Amazon\nYou'll ... and even on a raw search I found my what I just I find a ... or the history of the civil war by Michael Dunn and I have to re issue that to Michael Edwards but once you find that you'll find the link if you see the Michael lead but don't you click on that you'll get them all\nUp for people who are history buffs and you're wondering how can a Michael and went down to do this well Mike has been very smart about putting out a series of books ah regarding each\nEach\nPresident and the years of the United states while he was an office\nSo if you want to know for instance the United states and the time of Andrew Johnson it's holding now right it's our seniors Eighteen sixty five to Eighteen sixty nine hundred eighty two pages not the least bit intimidating it's a nice yeah I ... of that administration so he has written books that really cover each administration and as such\nThat if he was having an overall view of the history the United states Andrew\nJohnson is a tough one that is a tough area to study\nBecause reconstruction now the impeachment of the president loss of executive power and his competition with the with the Congress the grant\nBeing uh the new secretary of war and then handing the keys back or the economy or is it the whole reconstruction thing it's ugly it's not fun to study I'm establishing some clarity and simplicity there that I think it's worthwhile\nWhen I take that first break of the hour here it was one Nineteen in downtown Boston forty seven degrees we can live with dean Johnson Mike

I Can't remember who champs who played at the time see I I did it\nSo long ago it was when ... was actually a football powerhouse so you know what we're talking in the middle ages ... and had a decent football team and a lotta years\nYeah they used to be a part of a sudden they like\nI was going into mountain all mode and you know they had on the like fifty percent off track so I picked up a book a Hitler and trend and ah you know talks about you know um gold crumbles in a similar and\nWho's the ... that sounds familiar\nYeah he's from he's from he's from uh\nGermany I yeah I don't have it in front of me but I rarely find fascinating characters and I know you write mostly about American history I Wonder if you could recommend maybe a plan for me to read about the guys he\nJust sounds like a condensed chapters about um you know what I'm saying but boy these characters are really so loyal for Hitler and I really find it fascinating\nWill probably the best to books would be a by the Germans themselves the global diaries was ... and uh what's the other well the memoirs of castle ring is another one and a ... beer\nOkay so okay inside the third Reich by al ... I feel that when the ... and you get for the money when you're reading those guys you're getting inside their heads all day\nAnd there was another like I'll give you a great example I'm I'm reading the global diaries and I don't know what he's ... he's spent the the the fear is really down and I am too was so down\nIt's this is this spring it's it's it's just get it was so depressed and I'm thinking well the war really has these guys down it's it's certainly in the hour we'll do that yeah right now we're this is going and they came reading is over and over and said they were so\nAnd then I realized that starting on me they're talking about the cold weather\n[noise] really\nDry as a page after page the if you're always gets depressed when it's this call yeah guys gotta be kidding me of murdering millions of people and you're feeling sorry for yourself because it's cold you guys are insane that\nI I get blue when it's cloudy [laughter] honest to put a headless feeling though I'm feeling down\nAnd the ... at it but don't that's the type of thing where you ... and here's another one that's interesting to me they had a running problem with the church\nThey that the United states that are running problem with the church the resistance of the church we hear a lot about how the church collaborated I'm not saying anything in defense of the church where it's been proven they did collaborate but the Nazis had their hands full because they knew\nIf they started a resting and shooting priest they would have a backlash on their hands that would be counterproductive so yeah they had to put up with a lot of resistance\nThat they would basically they're warning and he's talking about global ...\nWe sent this priest another warning today but it watch your step and when this war is over will take care of business they kept that was their their plan was like okay we got a big problem in our hand with the church speaking up particularly the Catholic Church this speaking up in the ... we got to do some what do we can't do anything right now we're trying to win a war it's a delicate situation\nThe Germans always had more control over occupied countries\nThan their own yeah being interested because they have an ... for structure they have to respect within Germany whether it's the banks the schools the post office\nThe church you name it there's an established infrastructure so the Nazi regime was an over layer of an established infrastructure but they always knew there was sitting on a powder keg do writing the tiger at home\nIn France or Poland or Denmark or Norway they made all the rules and they didn't have to worry about resistance because resistance meant nothing resistance was futile but resistance in Germany was a serious problem\nNow from what I understand that you talk about that my that the policy was a Catholic Church was not resistance but individual priests and the like had resisted well you know it gives the policy was such that\nThe the ... the Vatican did not did not uh\nOh I Know and then not fight we did not as a woman was mad at me one night about the uh the the pope's a bishop if I Am not denying any of that on it like with all of my books and my friend of mine he's a good writer ... British says you're always fair\nThere you know you criticize people but you're always fear and that's all I'm saying if you wanted me to judge\nAs a totality the record of the church in World War two and Europe I'd say you know see mine is not good at all\nBut is it at a jewel if people react if there was another side to that story even if it's not enough to swing the balance is still should be heard and when you read the Nazis memoirs you realize they got a big problem on their hands and it's running\nAnd it was all even in some of the borderline uh countries we have a problem with the church because we can't just shoot the priest\nYeah that gets the mad yeah that that that would get somebody else we're going to ask you\nWe can ... an army officer that's trying to undermine the we hear he's trying to plot and overthrow of Hitler well you know we can shoot him but we can't shoot a priest cars that now we've got the people rebelling\nYeah they ... they would be someone to answer to and also the at that point perhaps the Vatican would have reacted in a way to so they give you some good ideas Ernie\nAnd Mike I'm I was amazed at how oil they either stop our work to Hitler Hitler basically their God you know what I'm saying\nWell some of them some of them resisted ... in particular and and your ... title and you'll do with a two foot liquors they do anything Hitler said and the other generals resented but the other side to try to be fair having read the memoir some of these guys wrote the memos and then they hang them so but at least they wrote the memos that some of them you know\nSome of them were talking about the allies you know with the El Al I hang them okay I thought you know they did their memoirs and then the\nRight but they in in the only thing they said in their defense which is interesting is that your ... and and in title they both had the same story to tell you know in the early stages of the war we did fight Hitler we screamed and yelled at him and he threatened to have us murdered\nAnd then we try it again and he threatened to have a short and then you reach a point where you just say I'm just better off doing whatever he says at first you know in Nineteen forty forty one I had screaming fights with the guy and the interesting thing about Hitler he allowed people to yell at him this styling was different you couldn't tell you said one word to start when you disappeared\nButts Hitler within his with his his coterie within his group\nHe allowed a lot of people that are really had a was what was a ribbon Trump near the barrel yes Reuben truck near the very end was having a fight with Hitler as soon as late forty four and he got him so angry that Hitler sat down and says ... must never speak to me again like\nMy heart is I'm an old man who knows if he wasn't even manual says you almost killed me\nNow and then as you said eventually they just decided well I'm only going to follow orders you might as well I'm only going to follow orders but windows rama play into all this because he was one of the old time\nGuards so if you want to get about forty five seconds rama is the most overrated general of World War two\nI Can't believe he said that it's an outrageous statement controversy controversy\nIs the most overrated general in the second World War I didn't say he was a bad general I didn't say he wasn't brilliant I didn't say he wasn't a great tactician I didn't say that he didn't have personal great qualities I said he's the most overrated general in the second World War I'll tell you why when we get back\nA ... boy that's about as good AT T's as as we could ask the topic we're we're discussing now\nSix one Seventy five or ten thirty is the number or eight eighty nine to nine ten do you want to be part of the conversation questions comments and the like hey we're always happy to do that right here quick break for the news forty six degrees outside as we can live every once in a couple of minutes\nWhen our family struggled with our son substance use we were scared and didn't know where to turn\nBut there is hope in families can he'll just like we did to connect with a trained parents specialist who can offer guidance and support for families in Massachusetts call our toll free parent helpline at one eight four four three one nine five nine nine nine or visit ... addiction support\nDot org message from the partnership for a drug Free Kids and the great can Center for addiction at Boston medical center\nW Veasey buses WXXI ... two men and I heard radio station\nThis is W.

than\nPerhaps we normally would ask me what I work done today what did you work on today Mike today I was rewriting I have a a book on the great war it's like seven hundred pages I'm busting up interest separate bookseller talking about World War one or what he will do yeah\nSo the book I'm working on right now is I took the first part of that book and I'm turning it into a book called um [noise] the\nHistory of World War one in the year Nineteen fourteen so it's a yearbook same ... with the same thing I did with World War two but this was a striking story I've tried to get to a couple of times it's called the broad fourteens it's something I wrote what the hell is that\nIt's an area in the water in the in the [noise]\nI guess it's the north sea and uh what was its it's October of Nineteen fourteen now the submarine is a new weapon nobody knows\nHow it's going to be used it it's a legend it has it's like you Captain Nemo was underwater huh you know it's like ... so nobody has been thinking very much all of the ... the pre war planning and the naval departments was fighting motor to Peter boats destroyers\nThat wasn't there was no anti submarine plan of any kind on anybody's radar\nSo there's these three ships are sitting around what it was called the ... here and I forget it off and what the other just these three British cruisers their old cruises and their manned by teenagers they're like training cruise oh terrific would possibly go with all of us so they're all sitting\nAround and it's just a normal day and all of a sudden boom boom one of them blows up\nIt's the you Nineteen I think it blows up and but the other two ships they don't know what just happened while one of Russia's towards the ship the other crews are thinking that it hit a mine or had an internal explosion as it gets it gets blown up boom\nCruz is going down Fifteen twenty minutes heavy loss of life now the third ship gets the idea hey wait a minute\nYeah maybe I should do it anyway I'm there\nSo it's ... but you know it ran into the right line of fire at so basically\nThree cruises vanished from the face of the earth in about thirty minutes and suddenly a new world of warfare has opened up but it happened at a place called the broad for teens and most of the victims were about fourteen or Fifteen a very young man\nOr a she said introduced a whole new chapter but the way it happened one so suddenly and no one was thinking about oh and the other thing is\nIt's noteworthy that these ships were warships interestingly there was no thought of using submarines to attack merchant ships for\nThe first several months with the war there wasn't even a thought of it it was considered a moral even the German so we're not going to do that we're not going to attack merchant ships with submarines where ... is a gentleman's was still\nAt there's going to use it's still a gentleman's or they're playing by the\nOnly going to sink we're only going to sink warships now here's what happened what what ruin that plant\nThe Germans had all these raiders all over the the world the end and the ... bird there all day and they were doing a pretty effective job for the first few months of the war these raiders these excellent worship but eventually they all were tracked down and extinguished\nAt that point the Kaiser looks around and says you know I I navy or surface navy we better hold on to it and keep it inside we better keep ... you can't risk it we don't have much left we just have to hold onto it there's a naval philosophy that says if you're the underdog\nYou are in charge of not being sunk ...\nBecause that seems like a a a good course of action generally the in the army in charge of not being sunk sea ray nice idea with the dog or not but the\nArmy doesn't have that that that's a it's a naval viewpoint the army doesn't have that the army doesn't mind say all or nothing would ever happen to you All right because if we get defeated we can scrape up another army\nBut if you're defeated in ... you lose six thirty seven capital shifts you can't create seven more to replace them right so the the the naval attitude the way they taught

[laughter] okay and they said the greatest president of all time Michael\nOr some people do it depends on what you're measuring greatness by and one thing I talk about in my books about uh the nineteenth century presidents the uh you know\nAll these absurd the Cleveland and Harris and we'll never know if this thing were reversed in other words if Benjamin Harrison was in charge in Nineteen forty two maybe he would have been the greatest president of all time\nWhat an interesting is on President a\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt had been in the White House in Eighteen eighty three maybe he would be someone with were laughing at oh he's so obscure\nIt to you can rise to the occasion unless the occasion is there a match if they'd been someone else presidents to Lincoln during the civil war\nThat's lasted ... to ... that's a new dresser and hey Gary good call thanks appreciate it that you are not alright thank you nice to hear that to appreciate it\nAll right we've got last break the evening we come back we're going to get those ... stories are gonna do that it's W.

I got\nI got to his own right up there on our past Saturday I get off on a hot as hell so this guy is a ... all of a sudden he pulls out this little\nCamera I I don't know I think it was a brownie or something like that I you know we're talking Nineteen Seventy to hear her hotel so he goes and goes oh look up on those two thirds of pictures fall and all their hand\nAnd I'd sure great you know I I just you know I gotta I gotta get a ... a beer or whatnot so he ... he puts on the stage\nAnd all of a sudden you know security comes running all over and Leon shakers that don't leave him alone so here I Am with those little camera and I'm taking all these pictures and he was doing I don't know if you remember Leon Russell but like ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... of course I remember\nYeah they would make these fade into the white powder you faces when they did all kinds of farming and everything you know so I took her out geez I don't know I took about at least a dozen shots or what not that great so now here I Am parched enemies got back cop sitting on his piano so I go over and I grabbed the cop\nAnd it was empty and you know I was out of out of shots and everything and I just work my way off the stage but uh you know getting back to in order to do like\n... did you use flash and then when they told me All right uh what'd you do ... I didn't\nKnow I I couldn't I couldn't use slashed I Would use you know the Baptists meeting available try acts and there was a a print film a color print from the code I came out with\nA right around the time I started that was my main stay which was a it say one thousand okay you get to technical um but the other thing was there was a trick I learned which made eight I figured it out early on that had a huge effect on my photography whatever film I was shooting I Would tell the camera that it was twice as fat\nMeaning if it was try acts and it was a four hundred I Would say it was eight hundred they would allow me to use a pastor shutters feed it and what I also discovered was and this was particularly true when I was shooting you were almost always shooting a delight object against the dark background\nMe you know back banned it was not you know every performer you see now has all kinds of lighting rigs and digital boards behind them back man it was almost always the band against a black\nBackground so this would trick the camera into being able to shoot up\nAfter shutter speed because you really did have more light than you were you know then you realize because the the the light meter with the all the black not realizing that the thing you were interested in had plenty of white so I Would I Would do that and that trick worked um and then you had a question about well I'm Sorry you had an oh about flash that was that\nI didn't use a flash as you said\nFor for the reason that you gave with with the with one exception every once in a while a band would come to town that didn't care about taking pictures and so I went to see a band called Bani haves and the wild combo I don't know if anybody remembers them they they Bonnie have a little bit of a career some minor hits and eventually\nJoined um at the other caller was talking about joined other bands as a as a guitar as well I was taking pictures than a club with this huge flash and I remember about two thirds of the way of the show\nThe guitars and the band finally had enough\nAnd walked right over to me and just stood and just stared at me because you know I was just blind date with this because I was so excited that I could use it because you know like I said most of the time\nAlmost always I was smuggling it in and I could not have a you know my equipment discovered so that was one of my view experiences with the flash and\nAnother thing about a flash that I didn't like what you've captured the show again this goes back to where I was shooting from your your flash would create the light\nWould wash out the light that was the was supposed to be the show\nSo you weren't actually seen the show at the performer intended it you were just seeing your flash lighting them up so that was another thing you know one of the great things about the prince photos I was talking about it that they really capture the the spectacular ... prints all his glory and that show how to bury\nThe purple rain tore had a just a tremendous light show that went with it and I was able to capture that\nIf I'd had a flash forget it\nRight because it was pretty much spotlight so to speak back then right but we always shut your camera on a on the fastest shutter speed as possible anyway\nI I Would but remember if you go to high\nYou you'll have been under expos negative\nYou know ... to buy you know if there's not enough like there's not enough white so I Would I Would trick it\nAnd it would give me so I could do it you know instead of doing a thirtieth I could do sixtieth or you know again we're getting a little practical here but um it it allowed me 'cause I I couldn't I did like to shoot anything below thirtieth they would get it would get blurry so um those were the some of the tricks that I use that\nLike I said there were some stocks of film that came out in the early eighties that we're a little faster Kodak was just starting to develop decent high speed a film stocks\nPrice so did you do any digital work now\nI Do I I I most of the people I'm part of the story that I tell them that this was kind of a career I had in the eighties and then I moved on into actually the film business um but I still dabbled in photography and almost everybody I Know who sort of started when I didn't want it to hold out and didn't want to give it to digital we all kind of gave up about two\nThousand and two two thousand and three because boy\nYou know it ... I'm so used to shooting so much so I'd go on vacation every anything I did I come home and I'd I'd spend two to three hundred dollars developing film so got good enough\nYou know suddenly you come home and you're not spending it die you know you plug it into your laptop\nSo I started doing digital and it's so different it's\nYou know first of all I I you know what I Would shoot like like a big show like it was talking about earlier the police chase stadium I Would shoot two to three hundred pictures now you know shoot photographers shoot three thousand pictures in for a song\nYou know your ... year practically filming it\nAnd just pulling out a frame you know at this point um but you know yeah and and I do dabble with it I mean like I said it's nice that it doesn't cost as much and if I go to a concert I definitely will bring a digital camera and it's funny because you know I'll go to a show and not thinking about it all she five hundred pictures you know aren't near it just really\n... you know do this to you but I have to go to news and about twenty seconds for ... there's\nNo problem thanks a lot of guys ... great show very nice talking to you and I talked\nTo answer I Can't make and then disappear so thank you And Julian thank you you tell it around and sell their cars that's coming up next but I Am so happy that you provided a home run for me I don't have you on again before the end of the problem is okay\nOh I Would I Would love to say beyond again and thank you for having me on and yet say Hi to add for me\nOr join you take care news is next\nTwenty Eighteen midterm elections are here and W. because he has you covered nationally and locally from the Senate race and governor's race in Massachusetts for control of the U.S house the twenty eighth team in turn will have a huge impact on every one this is Dan ... joined me for W.

um [noise]\nRules of engagement the show he did for CBS about ten twelve years ago when I saw a show or like there it was it was a good show\nAnd what I liked the most about it is and you you you could see you can see that he had grown I'm as an actor you know considerably since dawn party and all that kind of stuff right um it it was it he did a lot of reacting\nTo you know David Spade and the other actors on the show yes but he he's reached he had reached the point as an actor where even if the line he has to deliver is not particularly funny he'll delivered and that sort of dynamic deadpan\nYes way that it makes it funnier like like like a ... you know like as we just you know her if you're listening to the course all about you know the forest fire you know you know as far as a way of beer live near the force or\nYou know ... that's that's an ordinary line but he delivers it in such a way that makes you laugh and laugh out loud and I said you know and I as as as you you always try to break the ice with the guest or or or or print interview fan I said and as part of the ice breaking\nAnd I and I and I was ... and I met this when I said this I said\nYou know you've grown so much as an actor you know you ... your your style delivery and your your your way of delivering that Ruy understated humor reminds me so much of general garner in his prime\nAnd he said that's one of the that's the nicest complement anyone has ever given me and\nUh and then he went on to tell me that I you know he went on to say I'm I've been a gym garter found my entire life my mother barber lord worked with Jim and the stage production John of John's loves Mary in the early sixties\nAnd and and and he said to be even putting the same sentence as James Garner that's what I'm

V. it takes yeah these ... heart to heart yes Iran on the area of Ghana firing on two and a Half Men\nThey work into his dialogue yeah saying that word terrific I watched an old a two and a Half Men today was the first time we were introduced to the character any and you heard him say\nBut he got a way of saying it like nobody else to destroy like catch it like what we're talking about earlier with Patrick war\nBurden and Jim garner he's got that deadpan way of saying that that makes you it makes you laugh out loud it like a ... like Roger Moore had a few of those things you know talking ... right as ... as being a Patrick Robert no I've always loved to Seinfeld I'm\nDoes he have another persona that he acts with other than that party character boy said he uses on a ... or you know all the beer commercials and so forth\nOr use voice but a ... year for many years if I remember correctly and um he's also heard on either Family Guy Bob's burger\nIt was or perhaps that those shows I mean he does he does a lot of the stuff McFarlane shows so uh and and and as we mentioned a little while ago he does all those a public service announcements as the uh for for a ...\n... yeah yeah ... that's where the fuck that's forced the forces forbearance let's hear anything else ...\nYeah and and getting to the judge James Garner things ... who happens to be probably in my cup of three\nTelevision actors of all time um my printer I just wanted to mention according to read it you got a long time ago\nWhich was James Garner is the last uh adult in Hollywood okay you know when when the on her eighties people were taken over breakfast club people\nWhy suture point is okay\nYeah I yeah I I remember I remember a a a headline or whatever and then\nYeah something like that yeah yeah yeah that maybe that was it yes I I totally agree with that and um\nMy final question is you know there's a lot of the Rockford Files and my I think one of the reason there was so great it were were their character actors they just has a mating\nCharacter actors and all you know it just about every episode but are the ones that like the best or Tom cell playing um ...\nYeah and also Dennis dog and who I Believe is not currently under ... yeah ...\nIs a very busy director today but give a he was rich you ... and he got and and they gave him his own spin off color originally as\nA valid question did he did he have it on the show for a while for a while\nYeah it it only around for about five or six weeks I'm all in fact I even I even think if I remember correctly a white I think they ran it in Rockford time slot you know a dry and another area of\nSeventy eight or Seventy nine and a for whatever reason for for whatever reason it didn't go beyond those six shows they brought back to get in for a two part or in the final year\nOf ... a lot of potential at what ... what is it a show run by a as any of the ... were people I Believe the\nOld ... candle created it he may have done or that if I remember correctly or act\nOr in Wayne anything else\nJust going to say and just getting back to quickly Tom ... like I always thought that would have been a brilliant a show with Rockford and land in the same show you know like maverick well as those guys in the same show\nEvery week but you know well ... are up but they are there that\nThat that has potential I'll tell you this and you may already know this but I Love that Lance character who is just well yeah well sell like\n... I mean a ... a ... garner was was one of the show like mentors um especially in and that's and you saw that especially when when he had his own show with magnum he saw how Jim ran the set\nAnd interacted with his crew and took care of the crew and and made everyone feel at ease you know because television to a very difficult um\nWay of 'em in the industry because you got to shoot a lot of pages in a very few number of days and so is it uh it can be very ... and you can get a lot of pressure and notes from the network and this that the other thing and the star sets the tone at the store is cool and laid back\nEverybody else just relax at the stars uptight everyone else becomes uptight showed Selleck saw how Jim conducted themselves\nOn the set and set up professional but easy going tone where people work hard but Jim didn't micromanage and salad practice as a lot of what he learned from Jim to this day\nActual important right wing you're right that you're very much and I'll be getting a book\n... thank you burn right when when wing and Paul\nI I don't want to short shrift you burn\nMaybe we can squeeze you moron and if I have to bring you back um after the news so home burns Paul\nYeah Andrew future parents were appalled for me please\nPong\nWelcome to the w._b.\nMe therefore your voice sorority that over time you ... you mentioned doors but low pay yeah he did Huckleberry Hound any chance he did snuggle with yes\n...
