harvested all these games and now here we are witnessing involved all in uncertain times in all of a sudden their their portfolio might be dropping quicker than what their risk tolerance is really\nSet at so they became aggressive rather than moderate or conservative\nSo they need to re balanced portfolio so it's great when the market goes up when you become unbalanced and the market goes up great but when the market starts to correct itself and start the show signs of uncertainty then you start seeing that account dropping much quicker than you probably are willing to take

month you know what I'm getting is just not enough and taken in about twenty eight hundred dollars a month\nI kinda find myself worry and at the end of the month every month so I think I Need like

they feel powerful and then they go out and they get a gun and they do with this piece of garbage did yesterday and the other thing I Want to say about this is I really wish that everybody on television and radio would stop using the word deranged\nA it is I think it is unhelpful and and somewhat reckless because this guy was not deranged the bomber the would be bomber that it was something else we need to talk about that\nWas sending the packages to the Democratic politicians also not deranged and the man who shot the two black people in the kroger's in Kentucky also awful also horrific but you know they're not deranged what they have in common is it that they are criminals and you've heard me talk about this\nAnd we're going to keep talking about it because it is an important distinction because as long as we keep saying where it's like lunatic into range and mental health first of all\nIt's offensive to people who have mental health diagnoses because the vast majority of them are not homicidal\nMost than ten ... not most again I Can't I don't I won't make a generalization but if there's harm done more often than not people with mental health diagnoses are self injurious and unless you're talking about the extremely rare rare rare situation when you have maybe perhaps the skin\nGets a friend who has a break with reality and they think they're fighting you know or or whatever is in their mind they're manifestation\nThat's extremely rare and that's not the profile of all these people that we're talking about six and seven to five or ten thirty I Want to hear from you is that they are criminals and the definition of a criminal if somebody who was once who will\nWho wants to end will eventually do whatever they want whenever they want however they want it they have no discipline they have no compunction they have no morals they are amoral\nPieces of human refuse that's what they are criminals and unless and until we have a real conversation about this and we decide as a nation to nip it in the bud by which I mean put repeat offenders in jail for life\nLike this guy in Florida like the would be bomber now with the criminal murderer\nFrom from Pittsburgh I I ... the news is developing I haven't seen yet that he has a record and so we can actually cure a lot of this problem by going after the repeat criminals and putting them in jail before they become\n... murderers for people who don't have a criminal record and their first act is a mass murder that's a difficult problem and we shouldn't lie to the American public and say we have some kind of panacea because we don't I've wrote about this after the Parkland shooting\nYou can look my op ed in the ... in the little son I'll give you the title after the break but the the only thing you can do at this point is to guard against these kind of mass murderers is to have a premium defense and it's it's it's terrible\nThat schools and churches and synagogues are going to have to have\nSerious um security locks metal detectors whatever the the experts advise maybe you know whatever road that leads to we're going to have to do it now of course as soon as I say that\nI have to tell the whole truth which is what I Do hear a weekend live is that if you read that story on the shooter in Kentucky he tried to go into a what was the black church and the door he was banging on the door and the doors were locked\nSo obviously that save those lives but then he went to the Kroger and he murdered two people there so it's it's really horrible when a woman in the parking lot and then I think somebody else\nI'm I'll check those that somebody else in the store but really horrible horrible so it's we\nHave to balance freedom with security and there's all of these these\n... ferry as criminals roaming about so\nI think we should guard against anybody who says we have a one hundred percent solution because that's a lie\nBut I think at least we can guard the places that we can guard like\nChurches schools libraries even grocery stores you know what I'll pay I Will pay\nWhatever it takes twenty five cents more fifty cents more whatever it takes you know and I'll I'll reduce my food budget if if we need to have armed guards at grocery stores to save lives then then I'm all in for that too\nI'm six when seven to five or ten thirty if you all got other

b._b._c. news radio from our eye heart studio okay we're talking about the massacre yesterday at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh when here thought six when seven to science for ten thirty going to go back to Tom in Ohio\nAbout his race it make it for me over it you know it's a continuous the venue for just a second and and then to a a ... a grown another area\nWho thinks about that up an number one I think that uh in that situation he may have had somebody later on in life that affected him I can I can recall of the Harvard study a that a ... a sociology group\nThat went into a poverty area and they concluded that you know very early age at these kids had no chance in other words you're gonna miss was decades ago they were going to end up in a a ... you know behind bars and so forth well turned out that the majority of them\nWere ended up being professional and and when they went to interview these people they can remember one teacher and that teacher made them feel important right\nShe cared about ... and you know it's a matter of building up their steam it was a matter of coping skills\nUm it's a matter of great extent I think keep teaching people better social choked socializing skills\nAnd you know even the coping skills if we could better enforce those maybe we'd get a lot of people from turning to drugs that we see is an epidemic right now I\nKnow that the other part of this is I think uh immigration and I really think it I mean you just say well at the immigration tighten all this from the white from the standpoint that many of these\nUh white shooters white the massacres and so forth\nI I really think that it's a great extent not only do they fit the category of needing nearly nurturing but also they have been branded by the government as well as society in many instances\nFor the past fifty years as being inferior because of the minority preferences and so forth that for the past fifty years\nHave gone to a other groups\nAnd here's here's the kicker and it is that if if if that process was their fifty years ago as ... as you alluded to at taught ... countries but I haven't seen as for\nFor a decade now that if that were there in such a way as it should have been which was to write the injustices for\nA slavery and discrimination and segregation and the show that the the strict break the stereotypes that you know women and minorities can do jobs\nThat were typical typically held by white milk which you know the first one was done I'm Sorry the second one was done\nAs far as breaking the stereotypes stereotypes but what hasn't been done in many instances is getting the people who are for generations black Asian\nOr a Hispanic from the inner cities and and turning the gang gang violence into better jobs and lifting them up\nWell because all the money thing and we will because that's a lot because a lot of money the sec definitely immigration\nNot only that but a lot of the people coming in off the boat off the plane across the border who were not discriminate against facing discriminate segregation or anything else up are better selections ... then the people that it was intended for get passed over\nAnd the white males are still stepped aside so you have to endure groups you have the angry inner city group that are passed over and I think you know the white people were doing that to them and you have the white males who are looking at\nHey I'm no one's been victimized here on the one that's got the government on my back when they hear that from one of the supremacy groups some supremacy group has a scapegoat initiative since it's the Jews\nWell it was a Jewish people but I Want to push I mean I I I hear what you're saying but I Want to make sure that it's crystal clear that um I think they don't um if they feel that way toughened up for them the white men because it's like I I mean you can it's it's not an excuse number well no it's not yours\nAnd I know you're not saying I Know what I'm saying you're making somebody\nWho's vulnerable to duct that thought who who who does the the reality that for for the part of fifty years they've been to a step to step aside by the government for some other group and that's where you get the word she promised she\nSees really heated discussion I think so because it's like there's so many different levels so first of all it's it's not\nLike these these miscreants white guys and by the wayside in Florida I I I don't know that he's Filipino I think he was born here\nUm so that you know find he's a U.S citizen scum bags but um I I don't know that he's as Sara Lee white and I always hate having this discussion about whether you know what color the person is because of all the same they're all murderers to me and\nI agree and so what I'm saying but what everyone\nHere let me let me let me finish up the thought though after um because I always appreciate your input is that\nUm if we're always trying to dissect this problem based on race and so like these white men are susceptible to this hate because um of of the proper things we tried to do to make up for um the sins of our past\nWere never it's never it's never going to the ship is never going to write itself because I don't that's not the fundamental problem is the white men and the wife whoever it is the criminals whether the urban or suburban or whoever they are they're they're just going to like all criminals use those excuses to justify their actions\nAnd unless and until like I Want I Want everybody to sort of jumped on the field with me of condemning criminals across the spectrum left right center black white Indian age would ever do you know what I'm saying we start breaking it down in a form of behavior and I like you know people\nWho are calm and cool and collected and we are going to call out all the extremist and we are going to stop ... their behavior from the get go and I think that's the winning the winning solution is because I

R respects\nI'm to the Jewish community and I want to read this passage\nFrom Anne Frank's diary Tuesday march seventh Nineteen forty four and um there is here passage\nI'm quoting now and in the evening when I lie in bed and and my prayers with the words I think you got for all that is good and clear and beautiful I'm filled with joy then I think about the good of going into hiding of my house and with my whole ... of the Darren is as Peter\nAnd that which is still embryonic an impressionable and which we neither of us ... name or touch of that which will come sometime love the future happiness and of the beauty which exists in the world the world nature beauty and all all that his exquisite and fine\nI don't think then of all the misery of the beauty that still remains this is one of the things that money and I are so entirely different about her counsel when one feels melancholy is think of all the misery in the world and be thankful you are not sharing in it\nMy advice is going outside to the field enjoy nature and the sunshine go out and try to recapture happiness in yourself and then God think of all the beauty that still left in and around you and be happy I don't see how mommy's idea can be right because then how are you supposed to be have if you go through the misery yourself\nThen you are lost on the contrary I found that there was always some beauty left in nature sunshine freedom in yourself\nThese can all help you look at these things then you find yourself again thank God and then you regained your balance and who ever is happy will make others happy to he who has courage and faith will never perish in\nMisery wow I just can't recommend enough the reading of this book because it is an instruction is an instructional\nFor everybody and just as barber was saying those people who are happy don't do these horrible unspeakable murder is things and I go to pat in South Boston hello pat you're on the air\n[noise] good thing or is that the correct pregnant patent Murray's a pet\nBut race I'm Sorry about that okay rocking okay I'll Try mhm um I I Want to chip briefly coach a light it's like a\nKnow talk about Chelsea because I really think you're right about that I think that that is a major problem mhm and also it do they cut self reflect which uh\nAnd Frank obviously had down right I think it's an awful lot of\nA problem that they like it or problems that service to jealousy and I don't think enough attention paid to that factor I agree wholeheartedly\nI think it's kind of mesh because people are on a wrapped up that leads to other theories that go on and on\nOh go ahead oh you're going to say something\nI was going to say you're absolutely right about that and what's interesting is that you know basically what it comes down to is narcissism and it's interesting that you know the the DSM for the ... it's now the DSM five to die in a a diagnostic um\nA statistical now off the top of my ... cold um it listed the mental health diagnoses right\nAnd you know they call it the Bible well they actually removed narcissism as a diagnosis and\nI feel like maybe like the profession just throwing up their hands and basically like everybody's a nurse assist therefore it's like you can't diagnose it and because I think you're ... you're the\n... when I see as nurses ism is what you're saying is that this inability or actually just refusal to self reflect right it's a refusal if people to see anything besides it other than through the lens of their own\nTheir own personal pain their own experience and to never look at how somebody else might be hurting or experiencing something\n[noise] oh okay well very briefly a like a suspect get nauseous system may have been removed I could be wrong the DSM ... because they were so busy manufacturing always knew a diagnosis\n'cause they all just published papers and but that's my take on it\nBecause I point that\nYeah well I mean they have to Bush in order to stay employed et cetera et cetera\nAnd I also think I have a strong fear theory what I Do the urge that if somebody respects themselves\nThey are not going to be disrespectful to others or CIA property that's right [noise] I I think it it it it doesn't recognize that that ... there's also surfaces because there's a strong insecurity that may be matched by other sick\nRight I agree and that's where it got\nA long time ago I read ... I haven't read her she was quite remarkable but if people actually could get ours with themselves and spend a little time thinking about\nWhat they do and why they do it right they might be better people I maybe not but possibly could be\nI completely agree pat and and the the only the one directive I mean look it's it's great and you know when people help other people I think it's wonderful I mean I have a long career of doing exactly that but\nIf people can't help other people than there was one main directive that everybody needs to follow and that's you know harm do no harm okay if you take care of yourself properly and do no harm to others it's a pretty straight forward roll\nWell I think it ... version of that it's a show called golden rule I don't want to ... ... ... ... ...\nExactly also one of my they maxim for a living [laughter] fat\nAnd okay this is my first phone call to you but I'll just finish up with what the the\nFact that very few people acknowledge especially nowadays that what every single one person does affects everybody and there are many people don't want to accept responsibility for their actions\nExactly pat responsibility thing I Am running I Am really close to the break but I'm Wondering like yeah yeah 'cause it was important calling and your first time call call us again OK\nOkay I'll Try to get in a market Dexter\nYou're good thank you have a good night for about ... by okay\nAre you are listening to weekend live we're gonna come back after the break I Am your host Marie said Franco back at ten o'clock well welcome\nTo Jimmy done by your new nine green we saw was so good how do you make it\nHigher quality ingredients in line I mean we definitely don't sing along with my when it's baking slum either went parenting two babies right and we don't do the baby here you are to carry the warm ... subs to the cooling rack I mean they're not babies sandwiches\nOkay I'll take a turkey Tom oh don't name on it makes it harder dry our new nine Greene reached up to me ... ... yeah\n[noise]\nW. W. H. two years of image do you do and I had written\nBack to that lie fleet I I have said there's so many times on the air and yeah I Will keep repeating it although repeating thinks is not my favorite cup of tea [laughter] I'm the kind of person who I liked who are very good ideas I like to say them once and thirty much I'm under the next solution so but\nUnfortunately in politics and discussion things have to be said ad nauseam before they start ringing in to people's heads so I'll give it to you again\nThis is not asylum these are not asylum seekers flame bad economic conditions or street crime even horrific street crime gang violence does not qualify someone as a refugee\nThe media miss uses the word over and over again and they know what it means they know that the proper term for people fleeing these kinds of\nConditions is displaced person even people flee war or not refugees they are displaced persons unless you are specifically targeted for persecution by your government on the basis of five categories which are a political opinion ethnicity\nReligion race or social group\nWhich is a whole other discussion unto itself but unless you can connect whether you can show in next is between what between membership in one of those groups and the persecution\nAnd you are fear even fear for your life or grave bodily danger\nThat is not asylum if you can't prove one of those things\nAnd then there's a whole bunch of criteria that even if you hit that if you get if you make that that threshold you still may not improperly may not probably will not qualified okay to repeat flame bad economic conditions are street crime does not qualify someone as a refugee [noise]\nThe media knows the proper term is displaced person but the that doesn't that doesn't qualify for their emotional blackmail agenda so they use the term refugee and we can do\nDo you use we're only we can only make deductions based on the\nEvidence at hand so we can deduce from their repeated misuse of the word that they do it for the singular purpose of perpetrating like I said emotional blackmail on the American people want to hear from you six when seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to

Franco you're listening to\nWe can live with me or is it a Franco on\nThe b._b._c.\nNews radio ten thirty six one seven to five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty we are continuing our discussion of caravan caravan to point out from this year at least twenty team but as I wrote in my op ed today in the little son\nWell I wrote in my op ed which was published today in the last ... to be precise\nCaravan of thirty to a point though because this has gone been going on\nSince Reagan's amnesty an amnesty begets amnesty begets amnesty because amnesty\nAnd lawlessness begets lawlessness because lawlessness gets free benefits for illegal aliens and so on down the line and now back\nTo this vicious lie as perpetrated by many in the media that I was talking about before the break\nIs that these are refugees they're not as I said before true asylum seekers go to one of the forty legal ports of entry that are are long our southern border and I asked why do you think\nThat they do not get your your allegedly trekking and you're getting train rides or bus riser track rides for some of that but let's just assume you're walking the whole way the Fifteen hundred plus trek to the U.S border ... thank\nYou might be able to hit one of those forty eight legal ports of entry given that there every forty one point for three miles yeah ask yourself why they don't I'll tell you why\nBecause criminals don't go to them because they know they have no legal way to enter the U.S nor do they care\nTheir invaders plain and simple\nInvaders our enemies not our friends not refugees not the hapless poor\nDid you see some of the footage of the like some of those people look very well fed to well fed yeah I said that did you see the brand new baby carriage one of them had a lot of them you know they were not your emaciated walking pour that you would generally see\nUm people coming allegedly for the American\nDream and by the way to to see some of the guys with the tattoos yeah those hats [laughter]\nThere you know they're not just for fun please really I mean everybody just shoving this down our throats is just an absolute immoral illegal list and\nLike I said they're not the habits for they invade our borders in between legitimate ports of entry with one sole purpose to pillage America of her jobs for those that actually work\nNot going to say the majority but if they do\nVillages of her jobs are free benefits her everything that the goal\nNefarious people are organizing this assault on America and using kids in many instances as pawns to do it seven thousand plus people do not just come together organically without the machinations of coyotes cartels and there are better as\nPoor families is just one but one vicious lie perpetrated by the craven pools and pundits\nWho live and protected neighborhoods and who will never feel the dire consequences of destroyed borders and the desecration of law and order then evidently results from invasion denial\nThat the diagnosis invasion denial and they're oh\nIt's a rampant across the country going to go to we want to hear from you six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty we have Mike from Canada hello Mike you're on the air\n[noise] show you doing I'm well thanks how are you [noise]\n... ... because it would listen to the radio I listen to your show or like at a hearing camera or we're very close with the Americans we of are quite close cultural and the values and I find it odd that\nCanada in America are going through the same thing at the same time we're borders are being debated mhm\nBy people who do assimilate to our values they don't want to\nAnd they like what the\nPeople come from South America up to the United states [noise] once they get to the United states you think they're going to get jobs they're not they're going to be on welfare they're gonna be hill but they're not going to\nTry and assimilate into what America's values or they come from places that they don't care about things that I've noticed lately that you know the officials in both your country ended up buying ... they don't care about what the calmer person says if you if you raise your voice about it they call you a racist\nTackling exactly\nYou know it's just a truce you're always say I don't want people coming out of it\nThat don't assimilate to our values and they say oh you're a racist for say well no you know I don't know where people come on if they're going to do it they're supposed to do a lot of work and and and contribute to the economy but when they don't uh\nIt's just a burden on everybody else taxpayers just do you have to put the bill for them and you don't stay geo ... two hundred and eighty million people\nIn the states three hundred and twenty twenty five\nHere in Canada we only have thirty ... thirty eight million people and we're just being in in a number of people are coming from everywhere right yeah and you know go ahead Mike but\n\nWill just listen go home and contribute six one seven to five more ten thirty four eighty to ... ten thirty this these we can live on ... news radio pins are welcome back\nEverybody I'm your host Marie said Franco we are talking about invasion thirty two point oh where do I get that number that is derived from Ronald Reagan's Nineteen eighty six amnesty and since then and I that's the only one year so I'm actually probably be pretty conservative and that number 'cause\nIt's probably double depending on how you want to calculate the numbers it's in the millions obviously\nSo want to hear music twin seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty we're going to go to Joe [noise] [noise] hey\nHi okay so a lot in our way to acquire stating the obvious a lot of people call it and and then keep repeating the same you know obvious things with everyone already knows\nEverybody I like to give people you know\nIt's true it's true because I don't want to sound like a big old whatever here isn't so sure okay and this thing that needs to be done at the same time whichever comes first doesn't matter number\nNo benefits to anyone that's not a citizen of this country area very important maybe the solution is federal complains that with\nMore than a baby or\nJoe Joe I just want to jump in for thinking I Love you Eli give your solutions but don't think that I don't I get solutions on the show every week and I don't know you\nDon't want the colds you know people in the same thing over and over\nAnd say okay so you had all I don't know benefits we got it mhm\nYeah that's well no maybe anchors no one talks about people come from all countries they pop baby the baby automatically as American lives ... says whatsoever you cannot do it anywhere else in a war world if I go to friends Mexico Germany I bought a baby the baby ... not because of a citizen of the country\nThan just the craziness joke\nBirthright citizenship and it did it as a valid point and want to clarify off the top of my head I know you're correct Germany does not have birthright citizenship France I had the nose but not with me I'm like what\nIf what we don't want to get ... you know let's talk about a ...\nNo wait what I'm saying Joe it's like no but I Want people to know because every time somebody brings a birthright citizenship I Know a lot of people out there I\nThink like automatically and like oh racist in the constitution number one is not in the constitution and we can have a discussion that the number to like a lot of these left wing or is who always want to say let's do things away Western Europe dies and so my answer back to the ... Germany does not have\nBirthright citizenship nor I lot of the other Western European countries so I'm On board let's do it that way right so that exactly we want to talk about the fact\nThat a referendum on it you know obviously very simple no more no more a baby popping birthright citizenship and obviously secure the border and no path to citizenship to anyone who entered illegally uh let me go back to a country of origin you're\nPaying a correct leads up then you and your wife a green card okay yeah that that will do the basics then there's other little they don't you know voting whip to be careful about voting obviously um and and the little details but the basic oh wait insane just kind of\nBearing it out and we like ignoring it like as if it's not their brain let's send the army to the border are you gonna than imagine there were the country next door that gives you a million dollars just by getting to let's say Canada would give Americans million bucks if\nYou manage to cross the border you don't think Americans will figure out how to cross that border yeah of course who Wharton I probably would have detected a million bucks makes sense so\nNot made it is [laughter] you know what I mean I wouldn't want to\nDeal with all the time they both people were getting the problem was we know the problem the murder the way they ever stop your being called race it we know the problems no one wants to talk about solutions and even trial\nAs good as it doesn't like had addressed the issue of no more baby anchors and a story out and saying what are we doing\nJokes are free money\nI ... well I'm I talks that showed that that's them solution person so\nAmazing look just go to Don and you'll see there'll be nobody wants to come to this country got made it to work like a buddy that keeps saying you know the liberal racist or what was going to New Orleans older liberal thing that goes on to a racist\nAmerica will cleaned up on it all cleaned up boil it that's where I got a job if you pay good we set our exactly at the high you know probably ... thank thank you so much of a good night with bank\nOkay next we can go to rich in Pennsylvania rich you are on the

like their scholarships and internships and and everything I'm but only if you're a foreign language speaker\nNow or is that not\nWe um had loan it's funny or my we couldn't stand [noise] so I suggested that we learn English and we can just hang up for six months you know so it was\nBut I'm the I'm ray last week I remember which night had a near a school nurse all in ... talking about people coming here not being immunized and coming in spreading\nSo my question is to all of the people\nAre with all the degrees who think that this is a great idea\n... how do you feel\nAbout your children get all the rest of us\nThey don't care Patty because their children go to private schools they don't have to mix in with the mass is\nNot not that we're not all of them ... ... oh\nI mean I just people really need to think about that well\nThey do because we're seeing like TB we eradicated it's like there's all these incidences of resistant um measles weren't strains of measles and all different some [noise] God it's just it's it's a nice lady that we have to have this actual discussion\nFor these diseases that we've eradicated and then people all of a sudden like oh my God you're racist because you're saying immigrants bring disease no it's ... that people come from countries that don't have regular vaccination\nThat's tax\nIt you know I had the chicken pox wasn't perfect but that can go on to shingles mhm yes it's very very serious\nAnd we'll all as are a lot of the protests says and all different sorts of diseases that are coming back\nAnd they're not just come into the only reason they're coming back is because of immigration that is a point of fact\nAnd like you said how do people feel about their kids if there is I bet they I don't know maybe the ... like the the the purists then I don't use that word in a a complementary fashion the purists among them was like oh well I Would just let my child deal with it because this is a greater sacrifice for you know the downtrodden\nBut most people are already that the right ... you know your exactly right but you know what your private school if any difference I going to keep it in an\nExactly exactly and now I\nI really am horrified and I think people need to stand up listen and pay attention\nThat's where we're apps I agree Patty and it's not like this is\nI mean I don't I Want to be optimistic because if you know people won't be\nI'm motivated to act as they think that there's no solution so it's a sometimes but I also want to be honest it's like I I fear sometimes if I'm you know this is a losing battle but even if it is I still I mean I Know when I'm ready to fight\nOff I have voted ... you know I have cats my ballot [noise] and the voting those good\nExcellent as um I hear today that Elizabeth Warren showed up in Lawrence and I started a little too late [laughter] not a lot of fields and there are ... okay\nOkay yeah Patty I'm a little too little a little too late on a lot of friends I'm\nSo sorry I'm back to your question on the English I whenever I Want to circle back to your question an English language um it's like again there's a lot of ... it was funny Patty is that Democrats um\nA lot of Democrats were saying exactly the same thing the things that Trump Hussein now like I'm sure you've seen the footage of Dianne Feinstein talking about we're not going to be the this is Dianne Feinstein said we're not going to be the welfare nation from Mexico\nOK I'm paraphrasing here that's what she sat right and then and a Chuck Schumer is sitting there talking about illegal aliens and they can't come illegally and then there's footage of a rock Obama President Obama saying you can't come here legally\nAnd the same with Hillary Clinton and not that long ago\nRight and it's but it's it lays bear how craven they are because at one time they actually believed in securing America and secure borders but now that they hate Trump so much whatever he says they're going to say the opposite to the ... the whole country\nOut of the of the United states of America that\nMary ... unbelievable it's sick I mean I never thought in my lifetime I Would say anything like this the anger at age ... speaking papal neighbors you know it's just a shame you didn't think it\nIs shameful but that's why I Want people that's why that's why I write my op ed that's why I talk about this in a very methodical thorough fact filled\nBasis because I'm trying to get through to people that you don't have to scream and yell at each other you can I mean you you there is a there is a right way and a wrong way to do things and were you\nWhen you leave you with this vote and like the ... the Facebook group of friends of WB thing I'd say with good where I Am one who is progressive who wants to be outside his father is every court he and I going to sit down\nAnd have coffee oh that's very nice and I'm going to bring a friend and ask him to bring a friend and I I was selling crash that\nI didn't know how many people for the new report and that he ... I don't know what provoked you know what the comment was mhm so I'm encouraged\nWill say we report back to us Patty and tell us and I will you know more about the need to do that I agree absolutely a hundred percent thank you so much for your call today Patty that they care by okay\nNext we're going to go to Alex and Ontario hello Alex you're on the air\nI'm like I'm up to something that you had a route towards Ron but first I Want to make a comment a Tom\nBut mom how many bees or does it not even really have as much to do what they mean edition of so much of this stuff might even be resistant to anything we could draw to do to generations of poor dream and sanitation\nIn America are in those countries and other countries bowls and as well as I said ... there's um you know resistant means ... resistant strains\nOf measles that are popping up in Sweden and in this country and the same with TV and so it it's ... you know I I'm not an um you know a CDC doctor so it's not my area of expertise but from what I've read do you make a good point it can be either or herbal\nOkay with with the rich opening up school buses to train people to do the job the illegal aliens are doing in America and Canada are unemployment\nBorder as I said in my op ed they should shut down the border for three four five days a week I Know it will wreck havoc um and I frankly at this point lead Mexico feel the pain of the the shutdown of legal immigration\nImmigration should be allowed for several months each year like maybe three months on one month off three months on long month offer\nThat would be ... I I I'd rather just reduce the level of legal immigration across the board or apps and I'm a retailer out ourselves or you know Joe I'm Sorry I had and go into a heartbreak here but I Want to change\nThe war is I just wanted to say how it's been a while and I think you call again okay All right we again are going to go now we have a live\nRed Sox report with Sherry small is coming to you right at this break with they live report over to Sherry\nThanks Murray or W.

fifty sometimes a hundred people and you if you want to be shy you can sit in the back but you were going to give you a lot of great information you sort of can take a first brush it hey maybe I haven't done this so I've done a good job and who knows\nBut it's an opportunity for people to get more educated and again let me just shut up those dates Saturday October twenty seventh\nWill be in debt I'm ... and Tuesday October thirtieth will be and will burn and if you want more information you can you do need to sign up you can get your reservation go straight to our website I just don't lose the money dot com again it's just don't lose the money dot com\nSame I got to interrupt you here because I I spoke with Bobby as of late and and there's a limited amount of seats are remaining yeah so they got to go to\nJust don't lose the money dot com very quickly yeah that one's at twelve o'clock at night so I think people are trying to sneak on and their lunch hour and work maybe yeah so again just don't lose the money dot com where you can come to learn more about what you need to do in retirement you know we were talking about the perfect storm of opportunity but also Mike I think the one thing we want to bring up is\nA lot of times people don't have an exit strategy [laughter]\nYeah I sat down with someone last week a Sam and they had they actually were retired and they had a million dollars in their four O. one K. and they were just planning on withdrawing a four percent I said well what happens if in four percent was an forty thousand a year sure that's what happens at the market drops ten percent that four percent becomes thirty six thousand dollars\nWhat are you gonna do that that's not enough or it's getting close to the point where it's not enough right they didn't really think like some of the wall is that\nRight oh you if you want the forty thousand now you have to draw out more than four percent I remember I I met these people maybe like ten years ago and\nIt was a situation where there was nothing that I could do they came in and they said look you know we've got a million bucks just like your example ride we need to take out forty thousand dollars a year\nThey're broken tells them hey no problem you know we've done quite well and the market's done you know eight percent on average you know I've done even a better job you've earned even a little bit more no problem with the problem was they retired in two thousand\nAnd for the next three years the market went down\nAnd down and down\nBut they still need to pay the bills so they're drawing a forty thousand dollars a year for three years in a row and by the time they came to us they had like five hundred and fifty thousand bucks\nAnd now they need to draw forty thousand dollars in five fifty Ryan you know I'll be on the spot what's that math vets them percent yes just shy and that's like a Ninety percent down nine percent withdrawal rate and you know what no matter what you do is not going to work for an extended period of time so you don't really want to put yourself in that position and that's the whole idea of understanding\nAuctions understanding\nA allocation models for as you grow the money understanding what Reagan's our retirement income generators now you can diversify income source and really having an extraction plan you know we met some folks the other day\nFor a review their clients of ours have been caused Russia maybe ten twelve years\nHe's a dentist by trade successful practice but he's a solo practitioner and he said to me saying you know I'm like four years away from retirement you've done pretty good job with the stuff helping me understand what I'm going to get income from\nBut my my business is worth a lot of money and now I'm taking a steps to bring a new partners I'm looking at different options may be selling my business or maybe bringing in a junior partner and I can I can take to reduced role and maybe less make less money but I was still income coming in he's thinking about an exit strategy\nNot like the month before he retired she's thinking about an exit strategy five years before he wants to retire surf so that's the whole idea for folks that you know work for some corporation you don't just\nNot sure if work one day and think the rest of your twenty Thirty years is going to be fine you have to have a plan of attack\nSo saying let's talk about that plan of attack and and again I Want to remind everyone listening or now about the uh five steps to a successful retirement workshop that's coming

Franco here on weekend live on WB Z news radio ten thirty were talking about caravan lines two point oh just four months after the first one of this year fiscal year calendar year and\nBoth are slightly different but this this this is the second one\nAnd both of those time frames and it is a dastardly absolute lie that everyone fleeing is coming here for asylum there's a lot of criminals by the way\n... illegally is a crime so every person who went through the legally is\nYes a criminal let's just get that out of the way right now number to\nBuy the pathologist global is calculation oh you know these people are coming here because of the threats from gangs All right you want to go with that analysis well then why can't the people from Chicago in Detroit who faces kind of violence every single day in the city's why can't they flee to Canada\nWhy can't they just be let in and you know just go cross the border and get everything they get access to everything candidate has to offer or better yet\nWhy can't they just go into the nice\nRate reached the Tony neighborhoods of people like Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren over there in Cambridge and just come in and squat on their lines in or open their doors and say hey we're here you know with their bags packed were fleeing gang violence and Detroit in Chicago\nYou have to let it then you must you must you must I mean you're the very few humanitarian people\nThat say that illegal aliens can do this at the border so why can't we were us citizens right right and and and a lot of them descendants of slaves even why shouldn't they be allowed to go into ... all of these\nMostly white neighborhoods because all the Democrats living the mostly white richest neighborhoods in the country and just say hey we're here but I I'm I'm for that\nI'm an I'm announcing right now in for that everybody out there if you're listening to me in Chicago in Detroit or even in Boston here and you're having a tough time and you can't get any justice or fairness in your neighborhood go go into those neighborhoods in Cambridge and\nAnd and test this theory really\nI mean tell me tell me how that's ... that's incorrect because that's that's exactly the analogy that all these global list apologist the illegal immigrants illegal migration are supporting that that they're supporting we're going to go to we have re law hello ray you're on the air\nAnd well thanks how are you re I'm One of your biggest fan but my biggest\nAlready okay there's a competent healthy competition is always good to\nStart and I always felt it written there I I Will [laughter]\nOh good good good I'd how dare you make such you know\nMy ... mayor culpa here called ...\nBut I Want to touch I won't take up much of the time but I appreciate the ah the opportunity to talk for a moment of it um\nYou know like your your last one big on immigration but uh the last caller I Believe what was your last caller mentioned something about the second amendment I just wanted to but I'm not really you know we all saw the video what happened in Portland, Oregon I'll do what people\nDon't people trying to get to work just trying to go to support their families just up and you have this in yes I'm going to say the N word mob mob that's what it is an as offering them stopping them in traffic ... cards and stuff like that yeah so that anyone you know here in the People's Republic of Massachusetts\nAnd anybody goes to um you know their local cliche or what have you in all the if they qualify otherwise of course you know like I mean not criminals and\nI'm not the range do what I mean if they go and they apply for a permit to carry right I mean I Would take a copy of that video in Portland and go like this is why I as a citizen need to be on because these people were citizens they were trying to get to work and you didn't see a Portland police officer anywhere doing anything\nThat was terrible I mean these people were at the mercy of the mob you know so I mean you if you can't protect yourself\nYou know like this I'm a retired police officer who used to say it used to say you know when one second scout ... minutes ... minutes away Reno right and it's terrible you have to be able to protect yourself you know\nYou do and the uh the go ahead\nBut that having been said just to address the immigration thing which is why originally called you know I I think it would be wonderful if somebody had the goal of the guts I Would call it God's will and gall to publicize Elizabeth Warren's at rush\n[noise] I remember how are you I'm well thanks Maureen how are you\nI'm good I'm given a conservative estimate mhm ten percent of illegal aliens or criminal ten percent of the five thousand coming across the border [noise] don't have good intentions mhm\nFor every person that was saying to the planning on pulling the lever for a Democrat mhm [noise]\nThey had to make sure that they get down on their hands and knees and pray to God every day [noise]\n... mother father brother wife daughter son [noise] it's not killed by an illegal alien [noise] mhm [noise] or is charged with a crime without due process\nBecause that's exactly what they're going to get if they vote for Democrats [noise]\nPretty much an argument that Maureen and you know everybody will say oh you know you have everything\nI can hear the the uh so aggressive screaming out there about always you know queen immigration with criminality and two that I say you know like you just said whether it's five percent or ten percent or whether it's even one percent it matters because we already\nLike you know we the prayer you said Maureen we say this prayer to that our loved ones aren't aren't victims of US citizen criminal we got an right right right you got enough so it is not racist to say like we already own that we know we have\nCriminals who are U.S born and bred many generations here right got enough of those we don't want any and it's\nWhen we're when you're talking about like you said the numbers\nUm you know you got to keep in mind Nineteen hijackers for nine eleven Nineteen radically to to terrorists in San Bernardino right one in Orlando and I know people say they're going to land a guy was born in the U.S and if you know of course his family came from\nUm a ... in Afghanistan exactly um and so like those are only the examples off the top of my head\nAnd all it takes a few completely and he\nSaid ... percent that's a that's a conservative estimate\nIt it is yes and I actually I Will do on a future program and I've written about this before about um you know the the falls numbers that are out the out there including like from places like the Kato instituted who argue that\nThe number is small not no it's not and I will show and we'll talk about a\nLater date I'm usually I'm and using and I use actual\nUm numbers from the so called whatever progressive or liberal to show how their numbers actually demonstrate that the number is higher grade liberal criminality is higher than what they say you're ... right marine\nOne more thing I have to say I'm Still waiting for your podcast [noise] I Know\nYou can you can zip and email over to this I have time to thank\nYou um I we we're we want to get working on that so um you and me both Maureen\nI'm not getting any response from them\n[noise] All right but I still keep the mailing them I really appreciate that and if more people want to buy gas absolutely please everybody jump on board but I Will express Maureen Moreno fuss you risk your displeasure to\nPlease do people in would love to be able to listen to you thank you Mari every Sunday night I Wish it was more ... oh\nWell right now one once a week is you know we we\nGrowing do you have another job hard not to do that every Marine I super appreciate\nThe um the voter confidence and you know as soon as we get the pie cast up and going you'll be the first to know on air\nThank you very much Marie and have a have a good night thank you Bye bye\nOkay we are next going to have you in PA hello Hugh\nOh finally ... person\nMan how you doing more research to ... his own girl\nThat's right well I Know [laughter]\nBut I Love your short list with every Sunday night thank you and I was a really special because um I didn't really hear you before talk about like this is really a ... law mhm\nThat were ... people don't understand I mean Donald Trump and you know what it's not Donald Trump it thought about it because we learned back in ... in the Clinton era right mhm\nIt doesn't matter what the person is what is morals or we learned that you know\nOh I faced with that a long time ago Hugh when people like to like I just don't understand why people can't get it in their heads and that ah when ... when the economy's going well or Paul yeah these are being affects you waited that people like right Americans will take the policy over the person I mean it owning your world view I Want the\nPerfect person at the perfect policy but I'm Shockley haven't done that hasn't come across yet so we\nWe lower back and Bill Clinton\nCharacter didn't matter back then well let's apply with Donald Trump but the thing of it is ... ... thing of it is what we're dealing with today and it just happened just so closely it was like a week ago Donald Trump said Mexico\nIf you let this caravan come through here on earth put our military on the southern border and we are going to stop trading with you mhm\nGuy on the doors were not going to give you money rain and all of a sudden it stopped why because we have someone in this country who putting America First it's that simple\nIt is now viewed as leaders is exploited to five five thousand so you know it's just like and they just you've seen the video where they just they just don't this is an invasion\nYeah but what I'm saying is Donald Trump let's say and bring it on we are going to take on the fight and Donald Trump also knows that politically if he thought this was going to like kill is a\nPolitical stance he would not be doing this but he's not a politician you know\nNo ... well again for all of his lies I mean this is the one thing that is you know it's it's it's the policy first and the policy is you know you have to protect the borders of the country are you have no country and that's not just a cliche it's actually true\nI Know it when I was like people you know the guy Charlie tonight I Love Charlie burden before but he's like oh but he's such a you know I don't really like the way he approaches things as moral outlook and everything but I Love what he's doing in this country listen he's putting America First\nIf we don't do this in our history right now I don't know what this comes as go look like\nYou have it surely is one of the good guys you know and that's all I don't mind if you you know if he has a different opinion of Trump or doesn't necessarily like his character he's still on board with his policies are going to take like ... you know we want to keep our ally\nWhat I'm saying is Donald Trump is doing and what these people really want our country to do you know we have to we have to fight for our you know we're a country we need borders we fight for our borders\nWell and it's it's very simple hue and this started back in Nineteen sixty five and this was the Democrats' plan when they pass the immigration nationality act because it has become rightly or because they they stopped they stopped having ideas they stopped running on issues and they just\nSociety will just import a whole bunch of people from third world countries and get them to depend on the government and become lifetime that Democrat\nExactly and the thing is the ap said this before you and I'm I'm coming up on my brain I Want to finish this up with you\nUm is that you know who the real racist because in Nineteen sixty five what's important about that day that date is important for black Americans who were just beginning to climb into\nTheir civil rights ... you know come into their own accumulates finally their civil rights come into the workforce and bam we fled the country with um pour a migrant workers who do you think that affected most ineffective black Americans\nBut guess what memory I have a twenty six year old daughter who doesn't have health care right now but guess what any legal aliens die will get healthcare before\nI got to identify you're correct out on the show man thanks so much you take All right I Know we have\nSome people on the line please hold over till ten o'clock or I mean I keep on going with this subject and hold tight I'm Marie said Franco\nWhen the need for senior care arises there is no place like home your loved ones should never have to

opinion on on [noise] um we got here and and who's to blame if that's okay if I have a minute or so mhm\nI'm In September to sixty one in his first address to the United nations rhetoric it gave a brilliant speech though the the threat of\nWhat will happen if the lower and Central America is our um our to improve through capitalism stabilization of government\nReally fast forward to um [noise] then the mid eighties when two very bright men and great leaders of President Reagan in prime minister more ruining\nFirst wearing free trade to the upper America's cat and then I stayed\nAt the time they planted the seed [noise] um can bring Mexico and and the two people who are to blame 'em for them that we have today are are um\n[noise] a President Clinton and prime minister correction because by the time when they brought in Mexico in ...\nWhat they failed to do is initiated um the standard of living clause which President Trump has just into the NAFTA agreement there renegotiated NAFTA agreement the place is a school and what that is is is if\nGM for example if you have a GM plant\nPhil Ontario and one in Michigan right they're making the same way of saying basically the same the same plan right\nAnd Mexico for one question and and um Clinton brought it in there making like two bucks right and so what happened was prosperity\n... wasn't able to grow in the lower America's not they've done nothing and the Institute of the claws but any future company from Canada the United states\nThat opens up an office or manufacturing facility in the lower America's they maintain that standard of living you probably wouldn't see the exodus that we're seeing today\nThat they there's no question you have your lone wolf should always have your your idiots in my opinion you this leaves at the feet of of a Clinton and corruption and I think kudos should be given to the President Trump for for having the initiative to to enter the\nRace because it it it will have a filtering effect through the lower America is [noise]\nAnd um that's that's how I feel strongly about this and I and I [noise]\nSomething has to be done because the the just the lower forty eight but the the the the continental us with us from ... until they don't deserve this common\nNo it's it's an area of\nOur prime minister ... who loses slogan for as long as he's completely quiet on this because he knows the whole country they've got to come through before they get the candidate\nThat way and to be smog him\nAnd he has a lot of this this case of this issue these are the ... the phone and called President Trump and say what can we do\nAnd you know it was because he can avoid this hornet's nest but by doing nothing and it's and it's shameful but anyways I just wanted to express my opinion on on on how it was addressed and it was addressed brilliantly in sixty one but President Kennedy and ah\nIt's actually in ... sorry Richard if you're just an excellent point you're absolutely right but see if they had done what you're saying right to include the standard of living claws well then all those corporate donors on both the left in the right for the Democrats and Republicans you know they wouldn't have had all that money that they're rich themselves through NAFTA to give to\nThe Clintons and the Christians and you know the bushes and and what not right\nRight so you know is a nice donor planned for for the upper echelon for the political elites but not for anyone else including a regular Americans and regular Mexicans are Guatemalans Hondurans\nSo it's an excellent point Richard ...\nGreat show as always done the and I think it was a few who set of your callers ago hope you run for office\n[laughter] thank you Richard jewel busy right now but will keep you posted

I mean if you will wake in her basement for you it's a good idea to stop the flow the water running and then you deal with your deal with the rest of the wars on the poor exactly exact off but I\nKnow that the optics are going to be back here but um I mean fortunately we got the white white guy and all touched because you don't want\nI mean let's be clear we don't want to enter into international incident to be created so but once they step foot over our border um let's\nSee well but there are I disagree with you because then then they're hamstring do the same you know ... capture and release you know I mean that's the I I Believe it needs you know what I mean they they should try to I mean at that point and Mexico can't deal with these people and and you have your five thousand people\nSo I ... and they're getting ready to move across start hitting them with ... ... ... it's all on right there I I don't want to see the situation where where are our troops are are are drawn to you know had got these people\nOr I don't know right well see I'm that's not my area of expertise you know the sanctity of um the the foreign soil and looks if they're coming approaching if we have our border\nAre CBP or if the military if that's possible and they are at the border and um you know obviously international there is international law we can't step into Mexico um as as they're charging though as the as the invaders are charging um at what point thanking the CBP like you said throw tear gas and protect our land\nAnd you know again I you you know that I'm an expert and a lot of things but if I not a hundred percent sure or something I have to check that out\nAnd I'm for ah you know where that puts us in a straight jacket of course but I feel like if we have our border officers lined up on the border um you know so it's an impenetrable force and then they can push back push to people back into Mexico we should be able to do that\nWell what's her what's you know and I'll tell you what a two weeks or your vote for a Democrat gr for just a flat out through but I think we ought to be\nAny less what's it like all put up a print these in that any Democrat who do I mean I don't know I haven't found one yet you can tell me if you do if there was a Democrat out there who actually supports border for has been an immigration security\nMy question is what this ... is providing food sanitary facilities and sleeping arrangements for then\nI don't know I didn't get along with the foreign black lives matter I think it's George she's pumping money into these things in creating\nA lot of people yet I I've seen that common um that's like again it's quite possible I wouldn't doubt it but I don't want to say anything with any specificity unless I\nYou know can source it properly\nIs there any mechanism that we can do this guy is a citizen [noise]\nWell it's an let's take a step back for a second though also um the in addition to him it's quite clearly I'm sure coyotes and cartels are involved as well I don't think I Need proof of that\nUm him and make an educated deduction on that Jack I'm\nSo as far as ... goes it some\nYou know it's like it's is it is very amorphous because he's not breaking any laws um so how what we the only the only town or that we have to someone like him is to win votes at the ballot box for candidates who have strong stance on immigration I mean that's\nWhy Donald Trump one and twenty sixteen and you know for a lot of people that don't like a lot of things about him the one thing that\nI'm United a lot of voters you know and for all the people out there who want to say was racism you know I think a lot of black conservatives that you've seen talk about this or I'm Hispanic conservatives are Asian conservatives and um people from all across the the\nRacial spectrum Ron bore with Trump for one reason and one reason only because he took the security of the country seriously whereas um most of his opponents did not a few other Republicans were strong on immigration but not as strong as he was for his\nWell that's certainly true\nSorrows give money to the Democratic candidate for governor in ... between him and some other guy is going to run for president in the tone of six hundred thousand dollars\nI mean this is max on campaign contributions\nThere is except for then you have these dark or these dark organizations to five to seven is a whole complicated um like that'd be a full time job for me to just follow that\nBut you know the dark money that they talk about and so the world that you bring up a good point jak if there were if you and again campaign finance violations might be away my age you know that some\nYou know sort of how they got out on on taxes right right right and if there are people as we speak who has you know her being prosecuted for campaign violations that could be a way but my preferred way jak you know they sort of\nYou know through the back and forth as of all of that money and everything is my preferred way and this is why I ran for office and the first place my preferred my preferred solutions are always the lasting solutions and the only solution I can see out of this mess jackets for American people to wake up start reading about the people they're electing and elect a smart\nPeople who maybe they're boring or maybe they actually show up for everything and maybe they're dependable and start assessing candidates on that and not how much money they raised and assessing candidates on their ideas and assessing candidates on their character and unless and until American started doing that for themselves\nRight really keep having this conversation but like when Iran jak it's like you know how incredibly pie as incredibly lazy people are because they would say to me oh I didn't know you were running\nOkay in the maybe like Thirty years ago when you didn't have the Internet that might be valid right but in two thousand twelve and two dozen fourteen has this thing called the Internet and websites right and all they had to do is look at the party website and see who the candidates were and do their own homework\nBut they just continue to allow themselves to be fed by the media that has an agenda\nTo work it weren't for\nIran for us then and twenty twelve I was in the race ten months before dear old Liz and um you know there were six other men and all those chickens ran away when she got into the contest I said I I went all the way to the end and then I got word it at the convention\nThe\nWhole other story that jak will keep up the good work I enjoy listening to your excellent thank you for calling in have a good one vote early and vote often\nAsked thanks jak they get I buy\nAll right next we're going to go do we have Rick in New York Hello Rick you're on the air\nCameras are born with a breath of fresh air you are to hear you every time when I listen to a couple of times a month to nice to see somebody broadcasting more of a similar to the truth and you hear on most of the talk radio\nAny rate is one of the called Bush or know that in two thousand and one ... air was under a George Bush and sixty five hundred people armed troops down to the border to repel\nObama twelve hundred okay so they have the authority to do that and I hope the Trump followed through with that\nHow many was that for Obama Obama was only twelve hundred twelve hundred at the border say\nAll right he thinks for that and get it you know create that on fighting the good fight\nAnd I hear people like Jack and the other ones have called and I say God she's making a dent or at least there are some people up there with an open mind\nYes we're not we're not a monolith not even in Massachusetts\nAnd I think that I think I think ... I think it was Sarah Rose money but I Can't I wouldn't want to be quoted on it because I Can't prove it but you know there are things that I'm very you know I mean they ended up the conservative [laughter]\nOtherwise bring back the house un American activities ... and ... ... they won't do that that that's like what we did with the commie hunting in the fifties you know\nRight well there you know and there's a lot of like and that's a mix it's just that story always gets a little bit mixed up because you know there actually were communists size and it is not in it is not improper for us to go after communists fine I mean that it it got out of hand I\nAm like with every some things get out of hand but that doesn't mean that the original goal of rooting out actual spies like you know die and find things find science communists but I mean Chinese Communist by re her driver you know right is appropriate for us to go after those people right\nDefinitely definitely I think I think that uh you know they should be a little bit\nMore of that kind of thinking and the world but um you know I'm old fashioned so like I said [noise] but uh you know we just gotta I Wish that Americans in general would just grow a spine because if you have a house\nAnd there are some people that move and across the street you don't know who they are but they living across the street\nAnd after a while you see they're nice people you can invite him into your house great if they come in and and knock down your door and come into your house say they're gonna they're gonna feel a blast of a shotgun that Dan head off I wouldn't even think twice about it and that's the thing we're too much of a soft touch as a country\nWe've got now on the books all Evan thousand eleven million\nIllegal immigrants here but we're not twenty two is the actual thing that they did and they said it could be as high as thirty million was only three hundred million of us that one out of ten is illegal and say that I'm not saying that for any kind of a thing but\nIf there's that many people that came here and they came here from other places and they get free education and they get welfare and they get food stamps they get all these things what do you think they they do when they write a letter home they say it's terrible here\nYou know they say it's wonderful and then five more and more people are on our do you got it got it and they have no what do you think\nWhat what do you think would happen if you know we shot some people if you put a thing you know like nobody nobody snakes and area fifty one you notice\n... there are signs and I'd like to just idly instead of shooting people I'd just like to build the law and making me too me too it deportation of people who break the law but they are explained this was that I wrote a Boston Herald out that about this back in June and wreck and it was called illegal migrants exploit us weaknesses exactly what you're saying\nUh you know and so we are soft and we need to get um we don't need to be violent we just need to enforce the laws we already have\nLike ... I'm I'm I'm all for an awful legal immigration at welcome at you know I think it's the country needs to remain vital\nAbsolutely recommend against the heartbreak but I Want to let you go by thank you thank you Bye bye\n[noise] All right I Know you're on the line so if you're on the air please be patient I Will get you in the eleven o'clock hour we're going to continue this discussion ...

S. conflict may not be safe ground for you\nSo traditionally that isn't what happens a lot of people do flee they come through the you know the come to the to the un\nA legitimate port of entry whether it's an airport or a border port of entry and they claim asylum as soon as they enter\nAt a legitimate port of entry that actual aside and it's a very very tiny tiny tiny percentage of people that qualify for that but it does happen and it is that the very small\nAnd then when you hear country are you not supposed to go to the next country\nCorrect the neck of the country so that's very that's why I mean it's a tiny tiny tiny portion so you say and some people you know some people that claim asylum do\nCome from do have means you know so they actually can purchase a chicken an airline ticket and they do they make a direct flight um you know from their country again that is extremely rare extremely right\nSo how is it that these people are much and true too and the three countries to get to a place and I've watched the film with the three days now I'm telling you I just want to throw up right every single camera and every single person\nThat has been interviewed on camera ... not one person said it's too dangerous you know just to back up when you file a restraining order mhm ...\nMagic words are I fear for my life right mhm basically right okay I've I've dealt with enough restraining orders when you are fleeing the country\nThat when you stick a microphone you don't say well we want a better job ... you know we want to live better no that's not why you enjoy the country illegally I mean I Am she's so mad I Can't even begin I'm getting nail ... watching these marches\nAmericans should be but they haven't see those people haven't ... haven't been I tutored yet by the free lawyers and all the apologist groups but by the time they get to the U.S border Donna they will be well they are they all\nTake a Memphis separate rooms and tell them you know what to say I say it\nRight yeah it'll be parroting the proper lines and this is why this is but again it's that's why I'm calling it out because of people were truly fleeing persecution like you said and like I've said many times they will go to the first country of safety and they've passed\nThey ever passing through Mexico they can claim asylum there they can also go south right they could go to ... ... ... yes any play the Venezuelans are going to Colombia\nRight do you ever wonder why you went to like you know there's a ... excellent place every one a lot of people go to vacation there didn't anybody stop to ask themselves why aren't the Venezuelan storming the beaches of a robot\nYou know why because the country of the Netherlands would not put up with it the kingdom exactly right

particular Democrats again not all Democrats are in lockstep with this lurched to the left on immigration but the ones who are in the form in the forefront in the media and and\nUh the powers of the positions of power and the Democratic party are your favorite ... imagine if those thousands and hundreds of thousands of people all\nFollowed my Mother Teresa rule and just went full stop\nTheir own caravans their exodus from the U.S too and spread out across the world\nAnd I'm Talking about a massive numbers young dwarfing things like the Peace Corps go do it do it teach people about respect for women teach these ... women hating countries that you don't marry girls off at nine years old and you don't have ... you don't have um\nPolygamy and you don't burn your wife at the stake when the husband dies and you don't kill infant children\nUm you know when they're born because you prefer males and of course now that's done with selective abortion and your call down the list and and maybe you go out and you do that and then you start to change those third world countries and then they become\nMore developed countries and then they won't need to emigrate immigrate look problem solved

S. F. M. H. G. two men for an eye heart radio station [noise]\nBusiest W. B. C. news radio ten thirty or the news was never saw [noise]\nIn the realm a lot of things that she brought up so I think she\nDid a service to the country and to all of us Americans when she laid out point by point a lot of very specific pieces of information that fills in the gaps of all the rhetoric that's been going on so I'm going to start with [noise]\nYou know the the obvious is that\nIn Nineteen Ninety three\nAnd I'm quoting from her President Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three nominated Justice Ginsburg after the whitewater investigation was already underway and she was confirmed Ninety six to three\nThe next year just three months after independent counsel Robert Fisk was named to lead the whitewater investigation President Clinton nominated justice briar he was concerned confirmed eighty seven to nine\nNow why is that important\nI think it's phenomenally important because I think it shows that\nYou know this ... this all of this hubbub about President Trump can't have a justice get nominated justice because of this Mueller investigation number one is hogwash\nBut number two it also shows that you know Republicans they don't when President Clinton obviously one those elections that election and\nHe got his justices overwhelming majority so you know was it Ninety six Democrats voting there were half the amount of Republicans and same with the eighty seven to nine\nFor briar so it seems an and they were liberal justices I'm sure many of those Republicans voted for them had diametrically opposed beliefs and absolutely did not want to see\nThe philosophy of the court shift but you know they were grown ups they took their um consequences of not winning an election and and they overwhelmingly approved the justices and good for them so I think that's that's important to keep in mind\nThen the next the next issue second\nThat a lot of people wanted to try to make this argument well it's not about the sexual so it's not about his temperament it's really about his his allegiance is a legit allegiance to presidential power and that\nKavanaugh some kind of I'm Phil and forgiving presidents on\nUnlimited power again enter Susan call Senator Susan Collins a very she just laid it right out there and you know she had said that Kavanaugh when she asked him\nAbout opinions that he thought were important and he stated three ... three out of the four cases he stayed a worm ... versus Madison Youngstown Youngstown steel versus Sawyer and United States versus Nixon [noise]\nThree of the four greatest Supreme Court cases in history I'm quoting her speech and she asks what do they have in common each of them is a case where the courts served as a check on presidential power\nAnd I would know this is still Collins and I would note that the fourth case the judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as the greatest in history was brown versus board of education [noise]\nSo again they are very methodical fact based substance and if you have a justice that things Marbury Youngstown steel and Nixon are three important cases it does those are those are the bread crumbs to follow as to what their judicial philosophy is\nAnd I think that's important I Want to hear from you six when seven to five or ten thirty\nSo those were two very important points I thought that I Know they didn't they probably haven't the news has been given them most in the media hasn't given that a lot of coverage because\nThey're not sexy they're not salacious there there with them the other people in the media would term boring I don't because I think you know what everyone else thinks is boring I Know it was important and very serious because this is how\nDoes how things actually move forward and get done by looking at the substance by looking at\nWhat we lawyers I Know very um dinosaur wet dinosaur like in our dinosaur like ways of of looking at evidence and believing evidence is important well here's some evidence to show what\nThis justice now justice Kavanaugh's split judicial philosophy is about and\nI'm going to go on with some other points throughout the hour and I want to talk about that with you I Want to hear from you six when seven to five or ten thirty do you think those are two important points that senator Collins\nMade and are you happy with her vote I Am I think if he\nHad he not been confirmed I think it would have set a as long as we're talking about president I think it would have terrible one to basically say that you can play dirty tricks and dirty politics with anybody up for an appointment and this is the question I Want I Want to ask you tonight and I want you to think about\nIt because a lot of people are a lot of people all over the Twitter universe the Twitter verse whatever\nAre\nTrying to paint him as a little you know this elitist rich boy and there's no question he had he had a a good background\nI'm I'm sure he also worked hard as well and the fact is is like we can't just hate people because they came from um you know a certain background I mean hating someone because they're rich as the same same same problems heating someone because they're poor\nIt's it's it's it's stupid it's maniacal if Davis of and it's it's\nNot it's grouping someone into a group and then pull you know the sins of that group on to that individual and his anti American the foundation of America is that we take everyone as an individual\nThat's the point but what did the point I Want to make about\nEverybody ... trying to tar Kavanaugh's and elitist and someone in power and he used a system to his advantage is just think about this if he is as powerful and well off and wealthy as everyone\nSays he is\nAnd if they could do this to him if they could\nSmear him and nearly topple this nomination what do you think they're going to do to you out there who doesn't have power prestige connections\nOr any kind of defense when they came after you\nAnd and my answer is you won't be able to do anything because they will have you hook line and sinker and you're all done if you want to try to get into the realm of the powerful if you want to try to get into the top of your field\nThey will come after you with both barrels

everybody I'm your host Marie said Franco and you are listening to weekend live here on the b._b._c.\nNews radio ten thirty okay we're talking about the cabinet now confirmation and want to get your thoughts on Susan Collins speech her a yes vote and any other item you want to bring to the discussion going to go right to you we have gene from Salem hello Jane\nYou're on the air I attorney Mary for the Franco hygiene\nI Want to thank you for wrapping this topic I\nThink you You're welcome [laughter]\nI Want to I Want to thank Senator Susan Collins for having the courage to be thoughtful and to explain things to people\nAnd I heard the media like dissing her and I'm thinking wait a minute she's making total sense and I love to hear Chely top but we have a system Charlie men um as you pointed out to him so I just I'm a ... court rundown we've got\nJohn Roberts Clarence Thomas Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch all appointed by Republican presidents and Ruth Bader Ginsburg Stephen Breyer Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan all appointed by democratic presidents so\nYou know that fifty fifty and now we have Brett Kavanaugh by Trump and you know Neil Gorsuch was a Trump so it's it's we don't know which direction he's going to go in\nAnd that's the thing Jane everybody like with their hair on fire always jumping to conclusions and we all we know that a significant portion of this debate is really about abortion um but as people that are wrong in the past the\n... the only abortion thing because what you can see it suggests say the mob mentality I think Senator Susan Collins if I recall correctly in the news got three thousand hangers mail to her\nYeah yes I mean\nThe ... like I don't want to live in a country where it's mob mentality where people are thinking and with that their response\nUm I Do think out of the problem and it's not ages them but when people get power they never leave and they don't let the next generation come in they don't mentor people rate from that hearing Dianne Feinstein I think that they'd be five I might be wrong and I can't remember the gentleman who was the gentleman that was a champion from the Republican side I\nThink he's already five also wrestling um yeah I think that both in their eighties and we know we know nothing against people in their eighties I Love\nMy legal in the eighties Ruth Bader Ginsburg I think\nIs eighty five but the thing is I think about if people when does the next generation get a turn\nWhen they don't and what happens ... and that's like I Want to make this point because the joy joy may her from the view was kind of constantly old white men old white men and I pushed back against that because it's not the fact that people are all because if people knew seven if someone's in their seventies and they want to run for office the first time I'm I'm all for that right\nAbsolutely and I'm for gender neutral so I agree with you on that we're trying to be gender neutral\nLongevity but when people like this stay there he they skipped an entire used it skipped an entire generation because\nGeorge George Washington right our very first president made sure he didn't stay there and he did it for a reason\nRight but now people in the women in their fifties and sixties they're never going to get a shot because now and\nThey never got a shot and because they couldn't do it because the men would keep the men were were Bogart and all the seats okay we're in it because they're all up there in their eighties\nRight and now and now those women will will will be are going to be passed over because now they're too old great because not twenty seven years old and a socialist\nBut so and and that's the way\nWe only have two parties and I'm not a Republican and Bernie Sanders was not even an option he was a socialist and you know Hillary Clinton came with her baggage but looking at the cabinet guy what people were not looking at is his mom was a lawyer at the time\nThat women weren't lawyers his wife was there he's got two daughters himself said he sat more female if everybody's into this female thing clerks up to cook for the U.S Supreme Court maybe he's not as I I have no idea whether he bought it as a teenager if he brought to the other teenager I haven't\nNo idea I wasn't there mhm you know that was thirty seven years ago I'm pretty sure we all except for you I Know you're quite marvelous didn't have issues as a teenager a lot of us in America did because\nI mean there were things that happened to me that weren't pleasant you know that\nIt will it happen to us from all the women I've spoken to wear like who hasn't been bothered and yes we did all try to speak out but nobody listened\nAnd said I'm OK you know I have a confession to make okay please don't you don't have a vested already eight states I'm going to convince the thirty states I to drink beer in high school I tell my goodness and wine cooler too I mean that's the share various isn't like a\nBig thing that's so strange because there's all these every corner I go to visit new craft beer thing I don't see what the big issue is with beer but\nWell it was underage drinking and you know it's not right anybody out there who lives in the underage drinking is not right you shouldn't do it um you know but I just I'm honest about it and don't pretend like I didn't\nDo well and I if I recall correctly and I am older than you it was it was just turned from Eighteen to Twenty one back that was Eighteen you know\nEarly certain states yes yeah the only way they don't want to get on the conversation I hire use my attorney like thank you Jane [laughter] no no that's\nAll right and you know I I think what Susan Collins is explain to people you know we have a ... we we go by the rule of law mhm right and we have to process and even though this was a job interview you can't like take and destroy another human being based on not too much of anything\nWhen and I didn't happen I have no idea mhm but you know thirty seven years later and people hold on to the information it was just very very very political\nHe's on the left and the people in the left are always saying oh you know white privilege men um you know in Mazie Hirono his words shut up oh men should shut up right okay so\nSo Mazie Hirono is allowed to tell men to shut up but then men on the left like south McFarland is allowed to tell Susan Collins a woman what to do I mean does anyone ever look up\nThe definition of hypocrisy and the dictionary and by the way says McFarland is the creator of the character in his in his show\nUm quagmire who is basically a rapist and a sexual predator and he makes jokes about rape on his show and I found some parts of Family Guy funny but I really couldn't watch it\nA consistently because it was I just you know call me ... me or whatever you want um I have a wicked sense of humor of a\nWell developed sense of humor I don't think rape is funny I don't think a rape was unconscious of of unconscious women it's funny I don't think any kind of rape is funny and I don't think that character was funny so you know really McFarland take a good look in the mirror and I'm\nNever I it just this is the kind of BS that I just I Can't abide but one thing I Do want to say again as a thank you to senator Collins is that\nThis was I think I don't know it's hard to pick out the best part but I thought this was really just jumped off a jumped off the Senate floor and she'd see her into anybody who enter into anybody's hit the campus um and remember this\nFor time immemorial him in a quote that judge Kavanaugh is more\nOf a centrist in some of his critics maintain is reflected in the fact that he and chief judge Merrick Garland voted the same way in Ninety three percent of the cases that they heard together\nIndeed chief judge Garland joined in more than Ninety six percent of the majority opinion authored by judge Kavanaugh's dissent dean only once\nThat tells you everything you need to know\nBecause if Kavanaugh Garland who all the Democrats are in love with him and wanted to have on the court\nI'm In and was appointed by Obama and almost his mirror image and judge Kavanaugh\nNominated by Donald Trump what's the difference with the differentiate are there it's obviously Trump this is about two things abortion and Trump hating because\nI mean really cabin other there are more conservative justices that that Trump could have nominated I think numbers are very important numbers tell a lot of the story so remember that going to go next to we have hue and Pennsylvania hello Hugh you're on the air\nAlready so thank you very much oh my gosh you take all my all my topics here\nYou can you can give us a couple [laughter] virtual\nCenter says and cold and flu you know this whole thing was you know watch it everything for the past four weeks with God at all mhm but I didn't know where she was really going to come right\nBut when I watch or listen to a reward for speech ... it was like wow mhm she really put a lot of photos to my at the Susan Collins right you know\nAbsolutely I I think I'm again and it's it's not that great oratory happens on the Senate floor anymore these days you but I just I think that that will be studied hopefully in years to come I mean that's\nThe thing is you know what Melissa ... the thing of it rather than earlier\nIt's it's really this whole thing is about Donald Trump mhm\nIt really doesn't matter what ... what he did in his lifetime his expert geeze mhm we are so divided it's just like\nThe Democrats I I don't even want to call them Democrats the left yes they just want to just destroy this man mhm you know they\nDo and it's funny though few is because it and you know you\nMean you know with the town right like when somebody's line how you know somebody's line there's so many details about the left in in that it's just about pure hatred of Donald Trump is because a lot of the things that he's done we used to be actually core democratic positions under cars are on the ...\nRaces for like the\nOn the TPP right that was a ... that is a status any standard part of the Democratic platform to be against this this international trade that goes all the global\nCorporations with not thought for fair wages and environmental protections and all that right and then along comes Trump and heat that is a good word democratic message and then all of a sudden therefore tee ball because Trump is against it\nExactly but not only that like you said earlier to the ... or you know you are these people that all the Democrats and everything goes what the Democratic Party is not the Democratic party\nFast now it's not this is the left is this is socialism but\nDonald Trump I mean are you kidding me it's about the economy stupid and the guy has lowered the unemployment numbers since Nineteen sixty nine\nIn the last fifty years I think that is what they've been saying right yeah mhm anything\nI mean just look I work at a supermarket and it's owned by Amazon and these people are going to get a three dollar raise because it used to be the base rate was twelve dollars an hour now it's going to go to the game [laughter] and they're all you know slap and five and all but they don't know that Donald Trump is doing this\nRight mhm no pressure mhm\nBut it's because the economy is doing better we are bringing jobs back to this country the economy is really what it's all about\nAnd I thought how capitalism right you know I asked the question I mean um and so in ... they went to compete they're going after raises wages and then\nBut you know what man the mob rule and I mean this whole thing I saw the underbelly of\nReally what politics can really be well it's just they're very vicious getting people like like Marissa today people\nAnd yet I felt like a game for a second Marie Marie ... got\nPeople are watching NFL today right and then watch football games at all politics\nIs worse than that ... I mean they they just want to go for your juggler and that's what people have taken him up\nWell football has some rules right and you get kicked out of the gay and if you don't follow them all the time\nBut what I'm saying it's like people have to get involved and this is where it's like your vote really matters but you don't you you can't be like well I'm a Democrat I voted Democrat for the past Twenty years so I'm just going to vote for you know I'm a Democratic Party and all\nBut you were being hijacked by the left man\nThey are and this this one that he had no like this\nWatching and Jeff Flake being cornered in the elevator by paid by paid people okay\nDid you see the scene where Lindsey Graham is being chased down the hall yeah I mean this is awful and I said it before I thought it last week and I'll say it again if anybody ever did that to me in an elevator what they go to Jeff Flake sexual assault victim or not\nI Would have filed charges for that matter\nAnd assault and and maybe assault with intent to battery I wouldn't like they they have no way being a victim if you even if you are a victim gives you know right to invade someone else's personal space even a U.S senator that what the that was just that was so that was one of the lowest moment I saw\nThroughout like and screaming there is a way to you know you could go to his office you could um you know they could have been very professional they could have gotten the same message across right so it's\nReally not about Republican Democrat it's about like its ideology these people want to take our country and they want to turn it into a ... a socialist country well that's what they want to do\nAnd that's not going to happen if we have anything to say that he landslide at a time you're on the buddy you could hear from you have a good way to buy All right we're going to continue this discussion into the ten o'clock hour you are listening to ... radio ten thirty I Am a ...\nLot happens while you're asleep morning I'm Jonathan Weiner joining on the lawn there how are the Indians around to a\nOf following the news hour on by the time you're getting a having your first cup of coffee right\nUp here to bring all the news from around the world to know whether together any more they accuweather\nResponsibility to make sure you the best ones\nBecause we live here too easy names when the dirty\nW. V. the buses WXXI K. U. S. F. M. H. D. two men and I heard radio station\nBusiest W. B. C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never so [noise]\nComing through the ranks of a male dominated field and fighting those fights or you know plodding along and picking your battles because you have to pick your battles because there's usually about twenty different fights and\nTwenty different sexism friends that you could that you could take on but you really only have if you even have the luxury of fighting one it's a good day [laughter] so\nWhat it used to be it was about women being strong and independent and\nYou basically just people getting out of our way and letting us do what we're capable of doing and not try to grab us you know ... from the from behind not try to put your hand up our skirt or a your tongue down our throats or kiss on the mouth when you're at a bar association meeting yes that happened\nTo me and so I developed really quick reflexes and this person a very well known and democratic circles old left she kind of guy gross just really gross stuff okay but what would you know it's like what was going to do\nUm get on my soapbox in the middle of a bar association though I just turn my head and he hit my cheek and you know then I I always made sure to put my hand out really fast and next time so he'd have to shake my hand rather than coming in for the hug just like you know you develop mechanisms right uh because you just never going to get anywhere if you have to fight that fight every hour of your life\nUm but that's it was basically get out of our way stop touching us without our permission and let us do our jobs and respect us when we do a good job and re Munich rate us when we do a good job at the same rate that you were ... to man pay a man okay that's what feminism was supposed to be about women's rights okay\nNow I mean I just sat there just appalled about the fact that now women are so weak that they can't even be questioned by male senators and I I found that I that is just basically a total low point in the striving for women's rights because\nI understand why the Republicans did I understand the political reasons they had to do and I'm I'm not dissing them for that because I Know what would have happened they they were\nTrying to prevent the onslaught that was coming from the Democrats but the and that's the problem with the Democrats would use that oh here's men questioning a woman who's alleging that she is a sexual assault\nVictim you know what yes what little children\nHave to put that go on the stand and they get questioned by whoever the district attorney or the department of children and families attorney happens to be if it's a man or woman who's there that day um they questioned by both genders and these are children\nThis was a grown woman who was fifty one years old and the point of feminism is that\nUm we even even when we are victims\nYou were going to we we can still be strong and be question because we're when we enter the process that that's what happens when someone's life is at stake when you're when you\nHuge life at the cues person's life and freedom is at stake you have to have a system that is tough\nAnd that is demanding because if you're going to send somebody to jail you're going to ruin that person's life you better bring it you better bring all of it and I know how hard it is I don't know lectures needed about how hard it is been there done that and advocated for people who have been there done that\nUm this is the opposite to say a woman can be questioned by a man is the opposite of the original goals of the women's rights movement\nQuality was about society seen women a strong independent people with thoughts of their own not one standard of treatment for men and then the infantry ...\nOf women that is just unacceptable\nGoing to go right to the phones we have dug in Denver's hello Doug you're on the air\nAnd my dad got drop you okay All right\n[noise]\nOkay I'm not taking these calls of people are just going to try to use it to promo some YouTube they have out there not happening um yeah I I\nI you were wrong ready done with your promo of your you do\nAnd not happening and I really don't want people again I'm I'm In a flag people

fine\nI'm so I'm going to go to Susan in Chicago hello Susan you're on the air\nI'm or is it just a quick question is is much ado about nothing if by chance for all the way we're over turned by the Supreme Court [noise]\nWouldn't the stage than a permit abortions isn't it better for the state's main Illinois that blue state Massachusetts a California isn't it better to get these social issues back to the states and let their people decide Ten Commandments or think it's\nPossible I Do think that I\nI well I think it's um it's over the top for a couple of late for the reason you said but also for the reason that it's not a foregone conclusion even if they have what they think is the fifth vote against roe that it's actually\nGoing to happen because they thought you know they've been playing this card for a long time right first it was it was going to be suitor and Stevens Stevens and Souter and rate\nOf several Republican Justice Kennedy O'Connor\nRight and yeah role has her ... you know it it has made it has remained\nOn the bucks I'm like I say it's gonna you know be forever obviously there have been bad cases that have been overturned as they should have been plus he versus Ferguson of course right fine for sure but\nI don't think I mean I if if you believe if if you do support a reproductive choice and you you do we want to have a standard\nUm that is the same across the country but it also but on the other hand it would force the wood for states to actually take a stand on this issue and if they want to put the right to privacy into their state constitutions right\nAnd that would put it that would shift the burden on to the states to get their act together and they really would have\nTo you know they'd have to have this argument and you know what Susan right now right this very moment as we're sitting here nothing to stop in the states from doing that right\n[noise] nothing at all\nThey can do it tomorrow they could ... they could ... if they want you in their constitutions why are they doing that Susan [noise]\nHere the lawyer\nBecause nobody ever wants to take a stand if somebody else can do it the\nRight around the leaders don't want to do it because they're like oh well row is the law the land why should we bother\nYou were serious about if you were still ... says these soak all these people are right on these advocates you know they would have been on top of this Twenty years ago with their state legislatures and say let's do this do like this and try and get this and try and be preventive right you know in case\nBack up plan right but see but then that would force people at the state level to take a stand and they don't they don't want to talk about choice they don't want to talk about reproductive\nIssues and it's because they're they're wins\nOkay well I I think they are about twenty five blue states I'm sure they would if they were forced to you know my\nMy go ahead with it but that was my quick question of the question [laughter] so um so ... go ahead are you happy with the way it turned out\nOh yes Oh yes but the process was horrible so that way as you talked about [noise] anyway um don't want to take up your time thank you very much\nNo thank you as always says and keep calling like to hear from Jay okay say\nAll right we're going to take a quick break I'm Marie said Franco\nPursues we can

I. D. card right and I as I understand this isn't my area of expertise maybe you know more than I Do um\nI Know that um but they die and with that\nWhile I'm an amateur okay\nUm so that that is I I Do believe that's the way it works and I think it's a bad system because you shouldn't be your your Second Amendment rights shouldn't be beholden to the local officials determination there should be one standard for the state and then\nI'm like you know it starts from many sorry from the federal and then the state officials\nShould then um and that was limitations in in you know in the states but I don't think but that's I'm\nNow that's horrifying that local fish you know a local official could determine your right to own a gun or not because you know\nCurrent events in one more thing that you're um it seems like the Democrats are trying to use violence or violence to get their way ... you have first of all you have the shooting a year ago of of a Republican Congress both have the attack\nThat attack on a or a Rand Paul mhm yeah and er which was a very severe it\nUk law terrible right mhm\nYeah and then you have all these other incidental Barlow so\nI'm\nAlone you know what I mean people all the restaurants will software for Republicans should make a big issue out of this the the dumber clubs or like a bunker extremely well\nI Do I think many of them have and I think any right thinking Democrats should distance themselves in some Democrat out there like I I don't know\nLike a Joe Lieberman somebody in the mold of Joe Lieberman if they're even out there these\nDays I'm needs to come forward and shut down this mob\nViolence and just watching those people and saying shame shame it's like they think they they literally they're taking that from a movie they're taking that from a scene in game of Thrones and it just it's it's a poly like this is a joke to them and they think that they can go down the halls of Congress and in in restaurants I mean they did it to cure send\n'em Nielsen Pam Bondi now recently Ted Cruz it's just not and they were outside um you saw they were having them that beer party in front of McConnell's house you know it's\nI I have a lot of criticism for every single one of those um elected officials but I'll make my criticisms in a professional way right you know if you want to write a letter or you want to get you don't want to lobby or you want to run an opponent against that person those are the mechanisms we have in a democratic society not this mob violence and I am\nThrough our mission we hope to let that positive change for people of all ages\n\n\nYou'll just listen cone and contribute six one Seventy five or ten thirty four eighty to ...\nThis these we can live on WB Z news radio pins are welcome\nBack everybody I'm your host redefined how you're listening\nTo you did the b._b._c. news radio ten thirty were going to\nGo right to we have Larry in Maryland hello Larry you're on the air\nArmory so how do you think how are you\nPretty good um [noise] took your voice something you mentioned Fifteen minutes ago actually looked up ... or say hey to real short\nUm definition but definitely a surprise for me anyway says a pretense it's a male pretense of virtue benevolence or religious devotion mhm [noise]\nI Would have thought that would define sanctimonious gosh um [noise] do you know you know when I first learned about that as a kid apocryphal city and things like that you know getting into a more philosophical things seem better work then for\nWhat I Would call a double standard that people use and politicians are exceptional water above strikes mhm\nOr better word for that then of course she you know the double standard where they want to crucify she did something but they do it and re ... next week\nApple standard um\nNow the guy um and I\nI I have to yeah I I seem to have like a vague memory that there was no other word that was just more\nAnd more apt sorry\nElected outrage\nYeah I've seen a lot of that too and and I say you know I'm not a Democrat or Republican\nI guess I'm more of a progressive person who's also conservative about certain things but that's one of the things that really gets me is that double standard and politicians and people have known\nAnd I'm the best example and I I'd like to hear your [noise] I don't know what your thoughts\nOn it is that a judge Kavanaugh was being defended edge you know he should be afforded the I'm innocent until proven guilty principal ... which I can understand that I think applies at least a little bit in that situation but the people that\nShow the loudest and demand that this be you know strict in viable principal or the same ones who are been screaming for years\nAbout Hillary Clinton and I don't like her personally\nMhm but\nI mean this one was never even been charged with crock\nAnd you've got these people at the at the Republican conventions chanting lock her up lock her up and you're going to throw in jail and she should be in jail and ... and all this I mean it's really really too much because I Am trying trying\nTo be reasonable adults ... and not faint people with a broad brush her condemn them you know made for a\nErrors right but\nI it it's really cannot ear constantly now and that's what gets me is that they're still going that the Hillary saying you bring up something about now what's going on now what about Hillary ... what about this or that\nMay innocent till proven guilty that's your standard and if you can't abide by your own standards\nMy empathy for you and my level of respect for you just goes down show far becomes a a real burden I guess to try to build bridges which I Would much rather do\nYou know well it can lock her up chants is not helpful it doesn't um move the ball forward and uh it's you\nKnow it's basically and it's also a bit of being a store winner I'd say yeah a bit of what a sore winner they while yeah Sheila we won you know I just I mean isn't that sort of like liking the football in the end zone show it\nDown I was a kid ... when I was a kid I played football mostly you know my neighborhood or whatever but it was a big\nDeal back then roughly the sixties or said the mid sixties seventies\nBig thing from your parents your relative your coaches for teachers good sportsmanship mhm\nIt really was a principal that was to be here too and even the boy scouts I was the boy scouts for a couple of years right don't be a sore loser shake the other guy's hand when he beach and you know just give them credit and you know next time we try harder right you know\nYou don't these are what I'd say\nYeah there'll be a short winter either but God I hate it when I see these guys\nAttacking this woman [laughter] and I don't think I can recall an example where they did something like that to a man who had done supposedly the same level of you know whatever it is it's taken him off\nYou need for Hillary storming here this woman was the first lady from from Ninety three to two thousand and she never had a government job mhm and it was supposed to be or they're used to be an unwritten\nOh you don't go attacking the president's family I hear this stuff about Chelsea Clinton and how they used her found the foundation to pay for a wedding and there's no evidence for any of this stuff again this is what burns me up the same people that always worst proof where's\nThe evidence ... ... you know it's a um [noise] I had to have to wrap it up because they got them and it comes to fit in but they're good points and so basically what you're saying is if you if people want the innocent until proven guilty standard they need to apply it across the board and I think that's a very good point you're making 'em just\nBe even handed or try to be because you know what I'm really getting tired all this fighting between people of different political stripes\nRight founding bridges and not get married thank you for ... thank you again You're welcome and I\nAre eight we're going to go next to we have reining main hello Ryan you're on the air\n[laughter] Hi how are you tonight Murray's thanks very\nRon good good good I'm I'm from Maine as you just said and uh I've always liked to call in and I think she did a great job with her speech um and uh explains a lot of things it was nice to hear that um [noise]\nThe au bon this nominee I Can't remember the name Merrick Garland\nMerrick Garland that the that Kavanaugh agreed with Mary ... uh decisions like Ninety three percent I think she named something like that as an attack and so that's all fine but watching this and all of the talking heads on both sides of the different channels ...\nAnd and I think ... you've missed and I'm I'm stuck on it I don't think he should have been approved man\nJust starting this one point alone it really bothers me\nA ... it in his testimony on TV I Believe also in writing to the war thing\nAnd and now handle that topic very gently I Know around here but a lot of people don't know what ... is an directly lied about it but the thing is alcohol in and I think I can say that\nUm I I think most people don't know that ... and the reason that people do that is because the alcohol passes by deliver it gets you drunk or more drunk faster\nSo it's not a stretch to connect the dots between someone\nThat would have been into bull thing to also have blackout and so I'm really stuck on that I Know that if I'm I'm sixty one years old I Know that I knew someone in my undergraduate class that was into that we read the dealers less mhm\nI'm right now I Would hear on on the news\nAnd and tell me run I hate to cut you off but you went to hold on to the eleven o'clock hour 'cause I'm up against the heartbreak and I can we can say this was not sure if you take a hold and I'll be\nBack after this break I'm Reese a different kind of\n[noise] the the real story in\nThe Senate has just voted to approve Brett Kavanaugh as the newest member of the Supreme Court right now the Senate has in fact made it official\nIs a very exciting time but I think he's going to be a great great\nSupreme Court justice relevant\nDaily news radio\n\nW Veasey buses WXXI ... do men and heart radio station\nBusiest WB Z news radio ten thirty for the news was never stuff [noise]\nAnd ... and ... and so I won't say that any more but\nI just want to just come on the ground work what to say I think as long as long as ... let me make my point was an artist but just give it a second\nI no no no I'm not going to cut you off on I just want to I think that uh the ground work that needs to be late is that I Believe he said it was um flatulence is that I think that's correct yeah\nWhich is why ... ...\nIs not flatulence [laughter]\nAnd uh I thought it at one point anyone that said that that was their drinking game I guess not\nI think it's a was flatulence [laughter] and so you know that's lying on the testimony because there are a lot of the other side of the follow up on that and just Google the word the ask them to come to nail down the definition for out of his mouth\nI don't think he would have been confirmed because I Know I'm sixty one years old I'm a physician and I can tell you if one of my cohorts from my undergrad and college a hundred years ago\nUh that I was aware that they did that in college and all was drunk as often as she was and that seems pretty evident he'd been in dispute that too much but it's not a stretch so more than just the alcohol that matter it it it it's skirts around the liver the\nAlcohol goes directly or the look was just I guess you were a mortar on her way more fast\nBoat to connect the dots between that and the possibility of that person that admitted to that at that and then there was that he didn't ever had a blackout is no credible and and I I I I fall\nTo Democrats absolutely for holding on to so permission because I Would have seen a real investigation and nobody followed up on those things that I'm disgusted that someone who was a little thing\nIs now on the Supreme Court which would you not so here's my question to ... would you stand up and be upset if one of your undergraduate cohorts that you're aware that they were pretty big drinker which is an issue an alcoholic by the way if you're doing that you're\nNot drink socially you'll get your drinking to get [noise] crazy drop\nMhm that's an alcoholic mhm\nSo if one of your cohorts with that was a situation and that and then you haven't heard over Thirty years or whatever and then now there's ... to the Supreme Court would offer you\nWell a couple of things I Want to I Want to answer um want to jump back and I answer your question but I I don't want to let what\nYou said go unanswered because you said that it's conceivable that he would have blacked out and it's not credible\nI think that you're likely you know what I said this is the problem like run if you were if you were on the stand and I had to cross examine you I Would I Would really um it it wouldn't well on your side because you're jump you're you're jumping to several conclusions that wouldn't stand up\nUnder scrutiny because I agree that you know really because he might have done that okay and I'm not going to say the word again here's the list of questions like if does it mean that to here's here's because you know first of all I don't know it was it was their slang 'cause I I don't know about you\nWhen I was in high school and college we had our own internal slang right and we would make up words for different things and they would mean things that didn't worth addiction dictionary definition you see what I'm saying right slang in high school and college rights to play for one is that\nIs what you're saying it means is that what they said it means means number two that they said it was they they did this year book as a joke so did they actually engage in this activity\nOr are they just they did the caddy shack and courage and your book I don't know that should have been looked into by that was a senator his job to do that they didn't write too bad for them no matter isn't right exactly embraced survey so number three um if he did in fact\nDo that in ... in high school or college how many times did he do that we'd have to get you know we'd have to get testimony on how\nMany times did you do this and then you know if he did it once it's possible that you blacked out it's possible that you didn't blackout right if you did it ten times as possible you never blacked out at all ten out of ten times are you blacked out five\nAnd a ten times like that and I had a chance that you see where I'm going with it right and so you can't just make that leap from he did agree school air do he must've blacked out because and that's what the send the Democratic senators and I really resented\nRetrained to go with they were saying like because he probably blacked out air do he must have done it you know he might I Know I\nCouldn't agree with you more above my wife is because he admitted to it as an ally what it was\nOkay in my opinion he absolutely like what it was bright\nUm it required more investigation that didn't happen and I blame the Democrats for holding it and that's but that's why the Republicans politics movie with a look it's back as they held it\nAnd then it crossed all of us that we may have a a a an alcoholic person on the on the Supreme\nCourt to answer your questions about when you ask me about my core and then I'll ask but but how do we know that if you even if you were an alcoholic then is there not room to do that he might now Be Sober [noise]\nUm my soul but but ... is that would mean that he's a recovering alcoholic always\nThen and then that would be required as I Am coming clean and say I'm a recovering alcoholic which means he doesn't drink anymore right\nBut he still does so ... so it's either he's a alcoholic and needs to be lawyer who he's not an alcoholic don't you think if you had a drinking problem we know about it\nYou know many people function and and hide it very very very well\nThat I have well aware yes but ... why would we know about it because I mean it was a ... office and then when I'm\nAn answer on 'em because part of Ken Starr team and I'm Harvey Weinstein paid some private detective I don't know how many like tons of dollars to uh do back do apple opposition off all research on all of the people on Ken Starr steam so you know you as well as an alcoholic could hide it I\nDon't think and they found a lot of things about these people like remember Livingston the house the house had to resign because it was found that he was having an affair so they found that I don't you think they would have found out this this information about cabinet\nWell not necessarily now you're jumping to conclusions level though\nI'm putting out a hypothesis and putting out a hypothesis but I Want to answer your question about my ... like there are people I Will answer your question yes there are people that I've known in my past life in whether it's high school or college that I Do not to be good people and if\nI knew something about them and they were up for some kind of a lifetime appointment I Would come forward and I would tell the truth about them and no I wouldn't I and for some people it is you know some people can be redeemed\nThe ... you know there are some\nPeople that can't so yes the answer your question I Would be upset if somebody that I thought was not as a person was serving in some kind of\nA [laughter]\nYeah so I I'm an independent neither Democrat or Republican like I said well she's been calling and I think she missed the boat on that one issue which is ... ...\nI don't have enough around 'cause I got focus on lines but I'll give you the last the last ten seconds to say goodbye [laughter]\nOkay I think we all need to all of us right and left me to stop anything with a broad brush I've heard new cars so that I\nKnow that all the all Democrats are not socialists I didn't say that I never sold on ... so many people think that that's ridiculous gotta thank you\nBye All

back\nEverybody I'm your hosts ... you're listening to weekend live here on the b._b._c. news radio ten thirty okay so we're gonna go right to you in a moment but I just want to bring up another issue I've I've talked about this actually several times on the air because but it's I Will repeat it until maybe um\nIt gets paid attention to is this giant selective outrage on the side of people on the left and the\nMost I mean there's many examples and he'd go through but Roman Polanski All right I mean you have Harrison Ford right who's oh ah you know so I'm married married to Calista Flockhart and rah rah women and all that stuff\nHarrison Ford went to France in two thousand three to deliver the Oscar to Roman Polanski and the reason why Roman Polanski couldn't pick up his Oscar in our country the U.S in the United states of America is that he raped I Believe it was a Thirteen year old\nAfter dragging her with ... and then refused to stand justice in our country so he just wipe the you know wipes his feet um\nCommits his heinous crime on our soil and then high tells it out of here because he didn't want to be tried in a court\nOf our law disgusting and the people\nIn Hollywood can look at us with a straight face and talk about\nUm what\nRepublicans do I mean it's ghastly okay but that's not where it in because then you've got Whoopi Goldberg on the view and her buddy join bay are you know Joe ... like committing ages them on a daily basis talking about old people old men and um\nIt's like you know you can't you can't engage inequality and fairness if you're going to rant against every protected class because\nYou know if you owned an all women from and you didn't hire men you will be engaging in title seven discrimination joy they hire and if you don't hire people because they're old he ran against people 'cause they're old that's age discrimination so you're oh just so beyond the bounds but whoopee Goldberg in her Roman Polanski moment\nWas this she said quote I Know it wasn't rape rape it was something else but I don't believe it was rape rape he went to jail and when they let him out he was like you know\nYou know what this guy's going to give

strategies share with people\nAnd one of the ways that we help people safeguard what they have created an income stream is we use what we call the domino theory and it's really used by some of the greatest universities and some of the greatest colleges here in in the country\nBut that's just one of the many things that we can help people do to protect what they have and you were you were speaking earlier about stress for retirement I read the book maybe four years ago and it took me maybe two or three nights before going to bed 'cause there was so interesting I couldn't put it down and in fact if people call\nNow I'm going to take one step further I I don't know about you Michael my attention span sometimes [laughter] I\nWish that I give me a free book I might not read it\nBut if if they get this book and here's what I'm doing what a bookmark chapter seven seven chapter seven I'm In fact I'm On a book market with a crust one dollar bills or you won't you won't forget it you'll be short opening chapter seven talks about how to lock in your games it's very valuable\nWhen you talk about locking in your gains and means taking a little bit of what the market has given us and then you know again going back to your to rules never taking a loss and that's got to be important because a lot of folks\nI Would imagine are in the position of thinking like you were talking about that client just a a little bit ago he was sixty two and and he ... he can't go back to work\nUh so what he has has to last him for the rest of his life and write to retirement I mean that's that's a scary proposition there\nYou might get one shot at retirement that's at one time have you ever do it a second chance second time chances are something terribly wrong yeah you don't want you you want to make sure that especially like this gentleman sixty two you want to make sure you do it right you want to know your options listen it's it's worked too hard for that money you know\nEight seven seven six three zero eight seven eight seven four your complimentary copy of the book stress free retirement next five radio colors that is a for you eight seven seven six three zero eight seven eight seven to get\nFive to ten years out from retirement incredibly critical time and you guys really tackled this head on with your workshops that are coming up a little bit later on this month and usually\nYou know you guys start promoting these workshops and you guys start to hear feedback this particular time you guys have been hearing feedback about Saturday's give us some Saturday dates give us some Saturday days and you guys have come through again ... you know ...\nHours yeah I Know Saturday October twenty seventh later on this month Saturday October twenty seventh will be at the ...\n... am in the morning no traffic and then Tuesday October thirtieth\nWill be will burn and an noontime start and for um your reservation you can go to again just don't lose the money dot com you can register right on line just don't lose the money dot com John at those workshops we'll talk\nNot only about sort of our standard process of three sixty five retirement plan will talk a little bit about how important it is to understand the sequence of returns what does that mean returns well you know when you have time\nYou can weather the storm and people say John all the time I leave it alone I'll come back\nYeah I mean that for the person who has enough money to let it come back and have the time what happens is will sequence of returns Mike is\nAs a matter of when you want to start making withdrawals from your portfolio what's happening with the full full at that time of the withdrawal writes you if you're lucky\nAnd you have a couple of good use of gains you'll be okay but if you unlucky yeah like if you're in the first year your retirement and it was two thousand and eight and you were lucky the market went down will say forty percent you turn around you took a four percent because that's what you needed to offset Social Security and your arm do you use an income [laughter]\nFloat your portfolio last forty four percent that shocked the money's gone so the flip side if you have a couple of positive views and you're making ten percent for an example and you're only taken over four percent well your principles growing at six percent so the sequence of returns as is critical when it comes time to retire\nAnd I said it earlier here we are ... we all keep thinking the market\nHas lost his legs or what have you and it continues to chug along but the question is where is it going to be when it's time for you to start taking the withdrawals to live your life to all the time\nAnd that's why it's so important we talked earlier about today about the perfect storm of opportunity it'd be nearing retirement listen you've got two jobs\nProtect what you have because you probably have the most money ever a number to create an income plan so part of us three sixty five retirement plan not only shows you how you can pay your bills because the first thing that we do the bed rockets create an income plan but then John you do a great job and helping people choose the right type of investments\nWe put a portfolio together but I Will say don't don't go about it a long look for an advisor look for someone that you trust someone who knows what they're doing ask questions sit down with so and whether it be us another person don't try to go about at all because it's too\nBorn to try to do it yourself as right and you know we we said over and over we we took a team approach to wash almost Thirty years now we've had said to people you can come to one place under one roof and just really get everything that matters and retirement the taxes take a look at that\nYour state plan and make sure that you will as interests are in order on John you help them with their investments try to get you know the best return possible and most importantly\nThe bedrock of any good retirement plan knowing where you're gonna get income for the next twenty twenty five thirty years of your life\nAnd that is a long time and here's the beauty of all this the way I

... to everybody's a level of comfort ability in the classroom because next you know it's going to be well math gives me anxiety and I'm a girl so I Can't do math\nSo give me some alternative and\nI Can't do physics because I don't come from um a family that science that with a science background in physics makes me uncomfortable and\nCan't do chemistry because it's it's really anxiety producing and there's too many chemicals to have to remember I I like so so what does that leave us with that is not anxiety producing in high school\nNot sure maybe you can let me know six when seven to five or ten thirty want to hear your thoughts on this so\nThe the problem is and the news flash that I Would have for these kids is that I guess what everybody has anxiety about something and the way you temper that and you work through it is you\nPractice and you do something on a repeated basis until it becomes second nature\nThat's how most people get through life\nIn news flash life's not fair life not comfortable life is often unpleasant life is often downright hard and very taxing but you have two choices you can push through the pain you can push through the tough times and you know hopefully you have at least one person\nWhether it's a parent or a friend or a grandparent or somebody or a sibling that has your back and I hope you do I hope everyone does I Want that for everybody I Want everybody to have at least three or four people like that in\nTheir lives but you know have you represented\nKids in foster care who've been abandoned abused neglected a lot of people have no one and I've seen them persevere I've seen them do amazing things so\nI Know that you can do it to home one air from you six when seven to five for ten thirty if you think that teachers should allow kids should give kids a past do you think everybody think kids [noise] you think teachers should get\nIf kids a pass on oil presentations and let them do something else I I Am a hard no on that because you can't you can't show that you understand\nA lot of material unless you have a conversation about it and you have dialogue and you test your premise and then your teacher might shoot down your premise and then you're going to have to\nUh give another one you're going to have to present your ideas you're going to have to communicate your idea this is the very basis of human communication one of your music twin seven to five or ten thirty so\nWhat what are the options you know instead of doing in our presentation so you do written presentation where you already have to do that in most English and history type type classes but even in science classes that I had we had to do presentations and physics and chemistry in microbiology so\nMath all of them and you know we had to get up and go to the board and solve the problem improve our improve our ... prove the problem and so is that going to translate to you never if if kids don't want to do or a presentations in\nEnglish and history classes then are they going to next say we don't want to go to the board to prove our formula in a math class I just it's really amazing [noise]\nI mean I think that standards

I came from a school where you'd have a Ninety four in order to get an a and I got them\nUp but it's not that far points makes a big difference and so it's not bad enough I mean hey let me know are there still schools out there in Massachusetts that require a Ninety four fern a [noise] um\nI'd be interested in and learning that but the ones that I was dealing with it was Ninety within a so\nI I

Franco and you are listening to the b._b._c. news radio ten thirty\nThis is we can live with me or is it a Franco All right I Want to hear from you six when seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty I question for you should kids have to give oral presentations apparently there's\nSomewhat of a movement afoot to have for students to be given alternative options and here's\nHere are some of the let's see here's what some of them are asking for um they might want to present alone in front of the teacher or choose between alternatives like producing a piece of art I'm reading directly from the Atlantic article producing\nA piece of art or an essay for private Judgement instead of presenting the work orally no that's not okay those are not substitutes there's nothing remotely similar to producing a ... a piece of art\nTo public speaking and the same with the essay they are two different skill sets are eight\nSome people who can re really well can't speak at all and they're not good at it but they then they choose not do that for their profession there's some people who are very good at public speaking and not very good at writing again these are two different skill sets and\nOral presentation is communication at bottom line that's what it is and in a world where people's ability to communicate is going right down the toilet as fast as possible you think this is something we should stick to end\nYes require that the ... presentations be given and maybe people should have to go outside of their comfort zone and order if they want to get the a and they want to be a straight a student and they want to succeed in life then you have to produce the skills\nNot the other way around we're not doing a dumb it down so that you can do is comfortable to you because\nWhen you're in a courtroom or when you're an engineer or you're an air traffic controller or you're a\nOfficer or you're in many many many lines of work to actually require you to open your mouth and use it we want to have we want people to have good communication skills because they are critical\nAnd you know this one one student in the article said they're just going to skip school because it's uncomfortable and I said and without any snark whatsoever I mean this sincerely this girl's gonna be ... not a real great asset to the work world because\nEverybody in every job has things that they don't like to do it's called being an adult and a grown up and if you want to get paid you do those certain things and I said if it's dangerous you have to speak back ... you have to and you have to\nVerbalize your concern with something that might be in a dangerous might be a dangerous situation in the workplace by ha ha irony how will you be able to communicate those

V. the buses WMGK you ... do men and I had radio station\nSo six when seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty if you want to give a call in and talk about these issues I definitely want to hear from you so\nI'm going to give you a little bit of an overview and this first article it'd be really the title says it all but I'll give you some more of it it it's from New York magazine and so this is the kind of it kind of\nGives you an indication of the type of [noise] I Can't call it journalism uh ... what what do we want to call it slump their dishing out here is the title this is from October twelfth actually a couple of days ago in praise of beta or work the sweaty man [noise]\nSeriously that's the title and you know basically just give you the ... the opening line\nDemocratic Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke sweats and photos with supporters the bit of his shirt is always soaked in Racine Willie Nelson at a rally he lifts his arm to reveal a damp hacked\nHe constantly looks like he should be wearing one of those mylar space blankets that people get after running a marathon\nOh seriously the hero worship about a guy sweating and then the guy goes on and it apparently this writer is a writer for the Jimmy Fallon show I Believe as I suggested out so it's just sort of this this in red\nCompletely insular class and all these so called smart people yes that sarcasm I don't think they're smart but the problem is is they're all ... in control of our lives and it's this little coterie\nThis little enclave between Hollywood and the media and the Democratic party just\nShoving as hero worship in our face twenty four seven and I find it really disgusting and I find this picture Beto O'Rourke in his sweatshirt really disgusting I like it's just it's just ridiculous and then he\nTalks about the writer talks about how sweating did Nixon and as we all know the story people who heard that debate with Kennedy on the radio thought Nixon one people who saw obviously thought Kennedy when Kennedy one\nAnd so history you know went Kennedy's way in that instance so I Want to know if you think this kind of hero worship this kind of\nCool portrayal of Paul political candidates is helpful\nI think it's disgusting because while they waste all of this ain't talking a beta or sweating they can't be bothered to actually write substantive articles about candidates real candidates\nWho worked for a living who oh I don't know maybe have some good ideas you know probably the people who aren't the party favorite probably the people who are raising he raised thirty eight million dollars and of course the writer writes small\nThe way news flash in the case of everybody doesn't get it already when you do an average and you say the don't average donation was twenty dollars yes when you add up thousands of donations of people that gave two thousand and\nFive thousand dollars and then you throw all and the people of whom you gave five dollars it's not that people who are getting five dollars who are deciding the election because obviously\nWhen you do the math that brings the average down but the big donors are the ones who are giving the most of the money it's just that if we could just get rid of that fable\nIn politics I think that would be a big win six when seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty I Want to hear from you so\nContrast that right that thirty eight million dollars right so that's not buying ascendancy I don't know what is but then juxtapose that to this email from Tim Ryan who is a a democratic congressman and his he he quotes the Washington Post\nSaying the GOP is buying the house literally\nNo seriously it's\nSo you're going to sit there and ... they're going to sit there and complain about people on the Republican side spending money and allegedly buying races but then you've got to work who I Am sure wasn't raising thirty eight million dollars and grandma and grandpa on a pension I'm\nIt's ludicrous they're all buying elections newsflash six when seven to five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty so this this article about sweating man\nIs just one of the one of the pieces I mean you can just Google O'Rourke and unfortunately I'm giving him publicity I Know by talking about him but they tried to have a pretty standard rule of not doing that but at some point we have to talk about\nHow ridiculous these stories are but the part of his history that isn't getting highlighted is you know the guy was arrested for DWI and then he lied about it\nSo in this whole ... in this whole is going to say kerfuffle that's not the right word and this whole screaming\nMatch over the last two weeks about Brett Kavanaugh allegedly lying about drinking in high school and maybe and in college and like everybody's like he finally find anything\nThe standard does it also apply to a democratic\nCandidate I think we call that a double standard and I'm not okay with that and go into some of these\nDetails a little more but you know it's bad when he was trying to back out of his claims when the Washington Post gave him four Pinocchios calling I'm basically a big fat lie or any of course the Washington Post as the\nNewspaper of record for the Democratic party six and seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine
