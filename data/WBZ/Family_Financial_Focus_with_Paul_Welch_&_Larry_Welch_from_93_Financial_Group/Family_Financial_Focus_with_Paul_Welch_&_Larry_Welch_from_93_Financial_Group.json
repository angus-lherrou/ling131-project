the front line I think it's great that when we come together on a Saturday Night we can kind of go through what's been happening in the financial world in the market this week when we take a look at it and\nThen very boring oxygen\nVolatility is not going on in the mid term elections coming in God but I think the big question\nIs when people hear these snippets of news and little pieces of information what we really want to ask is well what does that mean for me you\nKnow what how was that actually affecting me right and I think we can answer that if we get you more um educated and have you have a better understanding of what you own why you own it once you know that then you'll know how it's affecting\nIt right does that make sense and how to affect the different economic cycles and yeah stock market cycles I well lecturing cycles I yeah I go through and we are really one world now some of the stuff\nThat I was listening to this week of that is all the global impact to hear what's going on in Saudi Arabia but you don't realize that\nThe Saudi money is money that goes to start ups in Silicon valley like we're such a one world world's running low and so what is happening around\nThe world as if the items that will come items that happen worldwide internationally can have an effect on our own US stock market has so that's\nUm you know that she realized and it's it's a situation that you know when you invest in the stock market you always have to invest it a long term mhm it's a long term objective is on short term cause any short term\nRewards you receive from the stock market can be taken away also on the short term yeah basis so it always has to be long term and there are so many items in that stock market that could affect a down would turn are positive turn mhm so you know in these last couple of weeks to market has been very\nVolatile there's no way around it but if you invested in in the market for the last two weeks of being one unhappy camper fly right right but you don't invest in my\nOf weeks you invest in the stock market over the next five years is always a long term objective that's why it's so important that you understand\nWhen you're allocating money in what positions you have that money in and way allocating that when they can't be a hundred percent in stock unless you're a you know thirty five forty years old his retirement money could have such a long term objective\nIf you are sixty years old or sixty five our retirement is you know facing you now within the next several years and years\nBut we have to take a hard look of how your allocating your money you don't want to be a hundred percent and start the objective has changed you have created wealth during your career\nTo um be able to maintain financial independence and you every time it so when you're getting close to retirement and at retirement it's no longer I got to create wealth it's I have to sustain this wealth I have to I have to sustain financial independence so the way that they are portfolio should look like you should have some in stock and our opinion\nBut it's the the objective now is to um keep up with inflation for long term growth on that stock they also have\nA portion of money in bonds which produce income and it's a good defense against it down would turn the stock market and you're you also have some money impress well protected accounts that thought affected by the movements of either the stocks and bonds\n... you know I Know I was just going to say that is one of those\nI was thinking when you said you might not be a happy camper now if you're just getting into the market right now five years from now you might be very happy if you're just starting they invest\nI Will get back in the election when Trump was elected you know many thought the market was gonna you know catapult go way down but\nIt didn't do that it it just rise and then it rise and then it rise and all the way up to the beginning\nOf this year and I was in an Eighteen so there was a lot of growth from the election all the way up to the beginning of the year two thousand Eighteen and it's interesting that we had you know we had volatile time in in January and February and then the market came back again mhm and we're almost at an all time high again so but now we're basically flat for the year\nAnd the stocks and so you say a self gee you know I had those games in two thousand Eighteen they seemed like they've been wiped out\nHere we are another volatile time but don't forget from the election up until the beginning of this year you have some tremendous growth in your portfolio so well really that the market isn't going to have some very good gains mhm in the last quarter of this year that could really happen\nBut if you make irrational decisions and say oh the markets real ball to right now I'm gonna take you know somebody out of that market you're gonna miss those games in those games are are going to happen so that's why it's so difficult\nTo invest with short term objectives you buy it market time you have to have that you know you have to understand a jury you're investing in stocks for a five year horizon\nBut ... it's been going up sending leave for a decade now correct basically\nSince the um you know the big correction back in two thousand two thousand nine but since March of ... the bottom of the market back in the um you know the mortgage crisis mighty it's been a very strong\nEconomic ... much a decade yeah but um you know what we say and people say all the time as\nUm you know costs right now with the volatility but just say as of January this year before there's been you know last year was very boring it was a good boring when the market because basically\nAll the industry is just kind of went up every month since well months yeah usually you never see that but um everybody is always happy when things are going in the right direction but they're never satisfied my right right what's gonna happen next there's always something on the horizon\nAnd uh you know this year here there's been volatility both in the equities um portion of the market in the fixed income the bond portion goes with equities just volatility with\nUm you know just the different indices and with everything going on with terrorists in the mid term elections coming up and also with fixed income\nAnd also related to some equities volatility is um [noise] with the rise in interest rates and interest rates going up with the fed raising interest rates in the ten year treasury over three percent or that causes um decline and market value and bonds and bond funds and also it can cause of volatility with equities ... 'cause I'm\nI'm investors may be saying well why am I taking risk with equity to get a\nTwo or three percent dividend if I can buy a ten year treasury with a three percent of it in a while so there's a lot of different things going on right now and then what the terrorists and um [noise] the uh you know like we said the whole global economy it's do you look at international that's down quite a bit this year [noise] so\nWhat we say you want to stay with your long term objectives you among from allocation in our opinion is diversification have a little bit of everything and it's just a pattern as a matter of what the waiting so much inequities how much and fixed income\nUm but don't you at all in our all out and don't just look you know back in like short term history like if you looked at international last December international do great ... double digit returns but if you say oh well there's going to put more international and all of this year international is way down\nAnd you might be saying oh I should get out of international right now because it's down ... we we said just the opposite you know when things have done well we're going to stay with that Johnny but we're going to trim some of the game you know when the international is up you know Trump some of the games and right now we're international is down we're not going to get\nA lot of it you know actually what we're going to do was maybe add to the ... the international while it's down\nBy old enough now how are you know that I Know that's what they said Riley balancing\nSo what we do with our clients as we stay with their long term allocation but we address these market cycles by doing the rebalancing right\nAnd this is really did um thought of as his kind of a conservative approach to right whether or not doing any kind of crap when I get it all in or all out or\nChange an hour waiting squeamish staying with the long term but addressing the cycles\nAre I Will be back right after this\n[noise] news

with these important questions call Lawrence Welsh and Paul Welsh principles of Ninety three financial group and hopes ... family financial focus heard Saturday at six PM on WB Z\nGeez I you know I I really like to have some help with this and they come in to see us and we would say\nOh you know if you want our hands on advice in Iraq to management we can open up an IRA and we use Charles Schwab as the custodian\nSo we would open up a child Schwab IRA from them ... and say this four hundred and twenty five thousand in there\nYou could roll over say four hundred thousand and then we would set up a you know what can a portfolio according to their objectives of well diversified you know strategic portfolio we'd be actively managing that and again uh you know depending on what their objectives are and how much to have um [noise]\nYou know in equities in principle protected and bonds um so now the majority of your money you can say well now I have some hands on help with that ... the four hundred thousand the twenty five thousand remaining\n... and your future contributions still stay at the employer plan so like I said we would also give our asset allocation suggestions for what's remaining and you knew contribution and we kind of look at it as a strategy hey if we'd be coming more conservative with the big amount of four hundred thousand\nThat remaining twenty five thousand in your future contributions you can be more aggressive with ... because you're adding every pay period and if the if the market went down you know you only have twenty five thousand going down not four hundred and twenty five thousand my aunt or new contributions you're buying a discount so there's like a whole strategy behind that\nSo that's you know that's an idea that you know we do help people with but just because you can roll over your ... doesn't mean you should we do a lot of analysis on that\nLeaving us with a cliffhanger now you got to figure out why we'll be back right after this\n[noise] do you have a question you would like tall or Larry to answer the call them during the week at eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three or four Ninety three financial group

details um Garofalo POW busy news radio ten thirty\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAre you ready for retirement [noise] find answers here on family financial focus with Paul and Larry well shit [noise] here's your host shown AC on it\nAnd we're back with family financial focus here I mean the ... here with us ... here and now Paul left us on the little cliffhanger earlier kind of a talking about the fact that most people we do get that the concept that\nYou know Twenty years ago it was like okay no more tensions no more uh you know different ways of having government being able to step in a big companies are taking care of you for the rest of your life you you know you work for a company get a pension you're done\nBy the companies now freeze their pensions or they don't ... them all done away with them entirely for you know the newer employee\nYeah and so ... but we did get the message that\nContribute everything you can see her four oh one K. that will be your retirement but you kind of left us on a cliffhanger pong going you know what do you do when you're fifty nine and a half I mean when you can roll it over into an individual retirement plan or why would you keep it in why would you not keep it in\nA while yeah I mean it's all according to your objective so I mean inside the four one K. there's usually you know an array of different investment choices and some of them are what they call target date funds which is kind of the simple way of allocating I don't always agree is the most beneficial but hey I'm retiring in\nTen years so you look ten years from now and you you invest in their twenty thirty five on the twenty forty fund so\nUm [noise] but if you um but then also there'll be a whole array of other investment choices um you know I'm ... and mid cap and international and some as active funds that have a higher\nExpense ratio and some index ... so I mean you are\nIf you kind of our do it yourself investor and you spend that time in ... and the different positions inside the four one K. and feel that you are confident in um continue on managing that\nThen in that there's some low cost investment choices some index funds and there you might say I'm just going to leave it there but if you're on the other end saying first of all I don't like all the investment choices there plus I don't have the confidence in myself and investing and there's really no help as far as active management in the fall when Kay\nSo I'm looking for some hands on help and that's when you would you know in a ... like a with a forum like ours you might say well I'll roll over a portion of it to the IRA where I Know that you know a forum can actually manage it for me and I don't have to spend the time or spend the worrying about it\nLike we have people that come in our office you know every now and then\nAnd they just reach the age of fifty nine and a half and they say okay I'm On a roll over my four oh one K. [laughter] and I write because they've been dissatisfied with the positions that are available in the four oh one K. and any ... for the most part\nIs going to have limited investment choices most give you know somewhere between twenty and thirty\nDifferent choices sometimes more or that you can allocate your money too but if you roll it over into your own individual IRA you're going to have you know thousands of choices and we can actually allocate that money\nSo some people who like in this question here they're dissatisfied with the new custodian as some insurance company they said and who knows what the actual\nPositions available for them to allocate the money ... and but you know whatever they are believing that it's not enough for what they're trying to accomplish with their money and we find that to be true sometimes so\nThe idea is you know roll over into your own individual IRA and then you can allocate many different areas and maybe more appropriately then you came with staying in the ...\nUm but there has to be a conversation that has to be you know understanding of what\nWhat's available in the foreign Kay first before you roll it over because sometimes people are just unaware that hey you know what it might make sense just to keep it in that for all and K\nMy right All right okay and so when you have the option say somebody does rolling into or a portion of it into an individual retirement account um than you are responsible for how your allocating your money unless you're working with professionals like yeah\nI mean you could you could just roll it over into an an IRA at any form you want a brokerage firm and manager just self just like you were kind of doing in the fall when Kay mhm I'm In like Larry mentioned you know when you roll it over to your own IRA and a brokerage firm like fidelity a swab or any place\nUm you know you can invest in anything you want individual stocks individual bonds mutual funds exchange traded funds basically you have the whole world of investing\nBut most people listening to us right now so I I Can't even figure out what funds inside the former cash I when I got an old roll it into an IRA and they have thousands of individual choices so most of the people coming into the U.S are not Raleigh Raleigh get over to an IRA because they want\nA more choices most of them are rolling it over to an irate because they want our help right and they want to have some protection from the downside I Want to have a strategic diversified portfolio they want to know somebody's actually managing the money addressing the market cycles is doing the rebalancing and that's what we do for our clients you know if you're listening for the first time this evening you might as well how do we do all that\nBut we are are in investment adviser for him here at the Ninety three financial group in investment advisor it doesn't mean any level of skill a training it's it's a license but you know we are when are you want to go to somebody that's been experiments we've been doing this many years but as an advisor\nWe advise worth the base advisors what that means is we actually manage our clients portfolio but we use no commission no low mutual funds and exchange traded funds but we don't hold the money we keep we use a custodian or the street name as a brokerage we use Charles Schwab\nSo if you decide to have us help you you open up a couch while we do it right at our office ... our opinion have the best of both worlds because\nYour your money's worth the big for 'em you have the comfort of knowing you know the big from Charles Schwab you get your statements from Schwab you get your uh um\nYou can go on Schwab dot com and look at your account even on your phone now but yet you have the hands on help with us ah actually managing the account so we're deciding you know how to allocate and how to protect from some you know market volatility and went to rebalance of different positions are up or down\nFor the following years income that's a great use of that extra growth\nBut if you're in your first year retirement and the first thing that happens in the equities you're expecting eight percent and it goes down five percent that's like I wasn't expecting that to him now what does that do to my entire my entire financial independence and all that ...\nBut when you invest you have to ... you have to understand that could happen\nSo that's why you don't have too high percentage inequities go even if the stock market goes down the equities\nThey still a lot of the equities we have in our class portfolios pay a lot of dividends those companies so you can you can certainly use some of the dividends for income but you don't want to be taking money from your equities for next year's income if the equities or down so that's why you have money and bonds and money and prints were protected account so you have sources of where to take that income from\nOn an annual basis as one of the things that we go over with our clients\nRight I was gonna say and like that has to all be very understood and strategize ten people need to know\nHow this is accumulating for my income and then Paul you were mentioning that\nWhen you're managing somebody's life savings I'm you know you do it it's a service but it's a one percent the on the overall investment but some people are like well why would I pay one percent can I get something cheaper\nWell that's what I'm saying you have to find value in the service just like anything else in life you know it's like if you need to uh\nRewire your your house well could I Do it myself or as a value to hire a professional electrician right right I think it's it's a value so you know electric cars yourself or to the same thing with um anything else in life but it's you know with your investments\nUm if you have it in a four one K. like we talked about you know before the last breaking it well I don't like the investment choices there I'm not confident and doing this on my own I Would like some professional help mhm\nAnd uh you know when you go to a professional in the financial industry is basically fee based on commission based do one way or the other you going to be\nPaying somebody something right um so as a fee based advisor we just fine it's it's a it's a we feel it costs we feel it's a better way to work because that's how we do it um but yeah you are paying out one percent fee\nBut hopefully you'll find value that hopefully we can say we're going to do any better but we're going to work hard for you\nBut I'm the value is that you don't have to worry about it you you're hiring us to worry about it for you mhm and um you get into professional guidance and\nAnd um you know that is being actively managed\nAnd the other thing is wherever your money is right now ... whether it's in a four one K. are you having another I raise our brokerage accounts of mutual funds or annuities\nThere's always some type of a um expense ratio or a commission or something you're paying ... but yet you know nobody may even be managing that so we can also do an analysis on your current investments to show you what you're currently paying\nAnd you may maybe pay more than one percent are not even know it but you might buy a pay a little bit more with the service like ours or you might pay about the same but it's all a matter of finding the value when you understand the relationship\nThat all we want you to do is do better\nThan I think you know that's a great way to work\nRight and I was just going to say like when you do have a couple of weeks like this when you're seeing the volatility in the market\nAnd you're going oh I I've been doing this on my own for I don't know if I'm doing the right thing I don't want to have that full responsibility on me I'm really never been in the financial world I'm a teacher or a college professor identity asked you know this is a different world for me um\nWell that's why people say though that I hear you say rebalancing Paul and I don't even know how I supposed to be invested right to begin with right away I Know when to rebalance sly and it's very intimidating doing doing it on your own I mean that's why most people don't do anything right kind of shell shocked\nFor I think the active management has um a lot to do with it too because our clients they know they come in like many classroom once or twice a year for review meetings and in those review meanings we're going we're still asking questions you know anything changed in\nYour life what's going on and sometimes it gives a different direction on how actually manage the money\nBut in those meetings we can give you know the his ... the historical performance of their accounts and how the performance has been signed inception so you know someone's been quiet for the last eight nine ten years whatever it might be there's a graph to show him this is where you began\nThis is how much money you invested in this where you are today ... and you've got an average annual return or whatever it might be\nAnd so it's very easy to fall that type of performance and\nYou would think you should be able

break Joni you know when people come in for you is that in our clients for many years and you know with showing them the actual performance they received\nSince day one is to see that and even though you know this year it might not look as positive as previous years but then you look at the average annual returned they've been receiving for the last five seven eight nine years whatever it is ...\nAnd even though this year has been lower it the average return because if you know I said of the clients eight years ago if I said you would average this much would you uh\nBeen happy with that you know see my way so you have to understand everything doesn't always go in one direction mhm unless you want to put in the bank and settle for one or two percent might um but it's all a matter of um you know what your objectives are and understand there's going to be ups and downs anyone can for the long term\nLong term I'm growth rate and knowing that we don't just sit and look at it oh it's up that's good well what's down that's too bad we address that by the rebalancing and change an hour waiting and looking what our clients need whether they're still accumulating or if they're taking out monthly income\nWhen they're withdrawing monthly income where we balance in and and feeding that income from you know whatever we feel is the ... when the best at that time\nIt really is a very personalized relationship oh it absolutely is and it and everybody is set up to meet their own any day now working for them yeah yeah it's terrible if people are just in the cookie cutter here's the deal here sixty All right we'll be back with more coming up after the news [noise] [noise]\nHello Paul and Larry well send the Ninety three financial group and host of family financial focus hurts Saturday evening to expand here on W. levy\nLet's take a moment and talk about for one k.'s and retirement planning\nPaul the traditional pension plans offered by employers are becoming something of the past many now just off a four one K. is putting more responsibility on the employees to secure their financial future\nThat's right Larry some funding to remember that far when Kay accounts may be the main source of income during your retirement years\nThat's why many are saying I really need to pay attention this time I only have a few years left before I retire\nAnd it would be easy if we're all productive in our careers ... and we have participated in the economy and we raise kids and we helped out we gave to charities and then when you're ... sixty five the government gives you a check for ten million dollars that say good job yeah\nThat's how I Would say so easy I Know they have that ten million to last for the rest of your life\nThen what do you do with the ten million I always a question like that now we are doing all those things and then still we have to you know plan for our own retirement and invest our money wisely drives what we're going to need to maintain that financial independence\nAnd we just kinda got that we're not that long ago was like oh and by the way did you you didn't get the note is that you are in charge of your own retirement oh I'm Sorry we didn't really put that out so that's another ... into our culture don't you feel like it wasn't like a big hey there we change this law now\nIt was it just kept seeping in and I mean I can tell you over the years just conversations with friends\nThat thought that they were working for a company because of this particular pension that they were offering only to find out ten years after working there they're like yeah they changed all that and then it really the it's all on\nWhat we say it all the time they don't know the previous generations Larry and you know my own parents I mean what father worked for the same corporation for forty years or so and when he retired he received a Social Security and his pension with a survivor benefits so our parents' income didn't change much after he retired than before he retired\nI'm you know that's a good thing in a bad thing I mean the good thing is they didn't really have to worry about their income they know exactly what was going to come in and then when my father passed away to survive a benefit you know for a mother where she received the grade of the to Social Security which was a fathers and she had to survive a benefit for the pension\nSo um she was still OK mhm um so the good thing is that wasn't a lot of 'em responsibility for them as far as what to do with the financial world how to invest money because it was pretty much the pension and Social Security like the bad thing is there was no\nUm grade our financial independence for them on as far as any flexibility in other words they had to live on that set income ... it was I'm like hey I have\nA sir I saved a certain amount of money and I can invest this I Know it's my responsibility or I can get some professional help\nBut uh maybe I can spend more money one year maybe I can spend less money more one year maybe I can withdraw some money to get to my children um whereas when you get a set pension and said Social Security uh basically live on that set income mhm so in today's world\nUh most of us are not going to receive the pensions you know most of us it will we be Social Security and his whatever we saved in our retirement accounts that's why I said all the time here on the radio or new people coming in is whatever you saved and your four one K. A. for all three beef for fifty seven IRAs whatever it might be\nYour total all that up when you retire that's your pension mhm and um\n[noise] in one way you can say oh I'd rather just you know I Wish I just had a pension but in another way it's I think a benefit because it provides\nIt's more flexibility whatever you saved\nIf you invest that wisely either on your own or with professional help you can produce the same income that you might have received for a pension but if you do a good job either on your own or with professional help\nYou can have more flexibility of need more money one year you can take it out if you don't need as much you can let it grow you give money to your children you can do whatever you want\nAnd if you do a real good job either with you on your own or with professional how\nYou can produce the same income you're could receive with the pension but he may be able to also leave more money to your loved ones filed it'll be something up you know what the pension and Social Security\nUm once you pass away and if this was five a benefit for your spouse she or he passes away that's it no more no nothing left for the family right where I go I'm In my opinion in one way it's it could be a much better thing\nThe but at the responsibility is all on you that's why you know younger people say save as much as you can and as you get close to retirement are at retirement invest wisely to produce the income you need but also um you know to not have too much risk not to be too conservative\nBecause the other thing we say quite a bit is you know with our parents receive and got pension wasn't some kind of magic wand where every month of checked just turned up in the mailbox such what you know our parents are with the pension right\nBut you know my father that worked at a huge corporation you know there was a pension fund with pension managers with millions are more\nIn um investments that the pension fund managers manage that money to produce the income for all the pension fund participants and still grow the money without too much risk right so basically your own four one K. that is your pension fund is up to you as your own pension fund manager\nTo invest it wisely and if you feel that you don't have the I'm confident and doing it on your own or you don't have the ambition or you don't want to spend the time the new hire your own pension fund manager will emotional like us\nRight where I read I think you know back in those type of days when Paul and I were growing up and we grew up in a suburb we grow up in ... ... um and so you know I remember as a kid my father talking to other fathers and the neighborhood of get-togethers are given whatever it might be in\nThat people would choose their careers based on some of the nation they were gonna yeah you know be within in a lot of that was about the pension mhm and what is the pension I'm going to receive how many years of service or I have a base\nYou know where the where they are employed with the benefits of that company and most of it was what is the pension right you know and today you don't hear that too much or too often any more than ... you know and we you know we grew up at a\nSmall ranch home and it was my my mom and dad race seven kids in that small ranch hill right right but it was never a way you know my father wasn't able to put away lots of money for retirement but he always had that security of knowing\nSome data retires he has a pension and ... but it could have been different he could uh you know he could have put money away in a four one K. and not have the pension and that could have been more advantageous\nAnd better results than having a pension itself my so the idea is is more opportunity out there now than ever has been before and the financial world it's just you as the investor the consumer the employee needs to take advantage of it and and not to be passive about it but I understand\nYou know what benefits are out there for me and and and things could work much better there's much more opportunity now an investment world than there ever has been before so you look at it\nYou know not as so to speak of a downer you look at it as a positive say hey you know what I write is money right before I K\nRather than maybe making less money or wherever it might be having the company had felt take money on my paycheck to put it in this pension fund that's got to produce X amount of money I can do better by myself\nRight or well just working with somebody that knows how to manage\nMoney in order to create your own ranch and that's really what we're talking about correct I mean you know who you are saying it seemed like some obscure thing like there was just some big bucket of money somewhere that goes and when you retire we're going to just take this from this pension ... but that whole pension fund\nWas managed using a lot of the same similar\nUm approaches that you already doing visual aid for our clients ... oh okay\nThere was a company that we're putting money away and the pension might imply nights company you're saying you know many companies participate and they are in the ... you know ... and you\nKnow as the um employee\nYou're taking that money that otherwise I went to a pension is going into the four oh one K. or the employer match yeah ... ... I mean you're going to look at it that we look at it as a positive mhm um but there are still some who get very good pensions so you know our next door neighbor grown up with a police officer you had a great pension now so\nIt does life every day Roy ... right right so the yeah those are the tradeoffs but I think people even just start\nTo really wrap their heads around okay my I keep saying my retirement fund our my four oh one K. think of that as your\nHeritage your pet is you're going to be a bench and it's a matter of you know how how good you were at contributing and saving and then how good you will be or if you get some professional help on allocating and producing the income\nRight now with finances isn't your thing it might have held out there this help will be back right after this [noise]\n\nHere's an important question what do you want out of your investments gross income or maybe it's just it didn't serve\nYou currently have stages in your life changed since you do your investments are you asking yourself it's not\nHow much I earned but how much I keep or maybe you're okay with the ups and downs of the market and more interested in that big number and the\nFuture remember it's not what investments you own but why you own them has your advisor been meeting with you on a regular basis or do you even have any one helping you with these important decisions if not come Ninety three financial group at eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three for ... for a free\nAnalysis of your current investments to help you decide\nIf they're still right for you call an eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three four principles of Ninety three financial group Lawrence Welsh and Paul well she can be heard as host of family financial focus Saturday\nNight just sit here on WB the Ninety three financial group eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three for for more information including their disclosures at Ninety three F.

Paul and Larry once you're here Ninety three financial group [laughter]\nI'm just I was kind of glancing over a little article you know I I work things out sometimes when I come here because I'm like oh we noticed over this you know we should go right but I and I know we've gone over before but it was it was kind of interesting that\nUm in money magazine they had a a little thing just on interpreting\nWhat Wall Street talk is all about and how expansive all these terms are and how different every planner adviser this one gets ... and it's like okay no wonder everybody is a bit overwhelmed when\nThere's a lot to do when how understand I understand and I'm\nYou know as I was reading this but also listening to you and you were before Paul going we try to make it simple we just make it really simple I think people can understand simple and I'm going you know what that is\nPretty well you look at how we work in the investment advisory it's it's it is one sentence comment is how we were we we managed your portfolio of all want to censor the very simple to understand the end yeah but I mean in\nThat yeah I Know people sometimes it brings out the wrong perception of what that might be right like we just explain there or you know everyone does every ... every advise every planet every broker shows they do what they feel is best and we know there are\nA investor advisers that have wetter skills where just one percent from zero dollars all the way up\nBut there are other investment advisers where they're charging much are they charged two percent not one percent two percent almost double yeah [laughter]\n... trooper said I don't know what it actually is from zero dollars at two hundred thousand that goes to one point seven five and two hundred three hundred and one more in five ... three hundred five hundred thousand different scales depending on your eyes remain\nJew us it's like well I mean that is due to present\nIt even if you invest over a million then there's still charging the two percent for the first couple of hundred thousand dollars right but they it's perfectly fine and but I Would say is that consumer than I Hope that I get two percent greater growth [laughter] to better no guarantee that everyone I just do the best that they can do\nBut whether you have an investment adviser and you're paying you will feel like with our from rich it's one percent a year we feel it's very um fair\nAnd for the work that we do for our clients we don't feel were overcharging anyone you know we hope no one ever feels like that one of our clients but wherever you have your money invested like we said before right someone just like you say Wall Street zones and making it in the wall street is not a charity yeah right and so in order to where you have money invested he learned that from me [laughter]\nLike everything else right yeah so but where you have any money invested there is some type of fees\nThat go along with it ... no one in investment world doing anything for free right so I don't mean to I just got finished ahead in every area of the investment world mhm and if you think about it\nUm there there's there's probably you know ... main areas so there are equities and then there are bonds and then there are a principal protected account so when you say\nDifferent types of a couch they can protect their principal what what one is really identifying most times is a some type of fixed annuity mhm\nSo if you you know just mentioning the word annuities\nMany investors run the other way right because they hear bad things about annuities and they're correct there's a lot of bad things about a lot of annuities out there and\nThere and I see commercials all the time and you need to ... do you know within the next commercial is never buying annuities which one do you believe exactly\nWhat I'm trying to explain is that there is a good the bad and the ugly mhm in annuities and there are some good in my opinion there are some good annuities out there\nThere are some some bad annuities out there and there are some fair annuities and out of there but you have to do research to try to find the best ones my but most consumers they don't have time to do the research I don't know how to do research and\nYou know what questions do I have to us to find out what show the good ones\nThat's the same and mutual fund some mutual funds are more expensive to own than others\nAnd you could say the same thing there is a good the bad and the ugly ... why would you have a mutual fund who's expense ratio was would say one point two five person when one of his peers expense ratio was you know point five percent mind and if you do your research and find out the historical returns of basically in the same ballpark and why are you paying point seven five percent more annually\nAnd just mentioning express ratios many investors don't even understand what that is but that's the internal expenses of owning different types of mutual funds are index funds or\nEven HGF is what is it really costing me\nMost investors are 'cause it's not in their statement they don't really know it's a perspective when they first and best invested in that position position\nOne thing I learned as every every investor reached their perspective is from page one out there is not under that come in and say I read this whole thing though I don't see this is why I I don't even think the people that I write those perspectives has read them but I Know this is I've never met anyone\nWho was a perspective prospectus writer\n... with the ... practices they give out today it's such a ... paper yeah you wonder how when they print it that it just doesn't fall apart it's amazing\nKnow what I'm Talking about um doing the things that come in the mail in a big envelope and then it's like\nSome something that you own and it's a really thin little paper and you just go off and you throw it in the trash because you know you're never going to read it you know recycling the recycling and that's what I meant but one of the things that and again we're we're all about making sure that your informed to ask the right questions\nUnderstanding that\nThere's some reason why they like to keep this whole industry less than very knowledgeable for the average person for the ... for not even the average print just the person that is out there doing a different career than the financial world and so when I was looking through some of these things\nAnd even when we're talking about what should you be looking for in your adviser and then I'm reading all these things and I'm like oh Paul Larry don't do any of that you know I mean when they're saying recommendations and you're saying I it says it may take a few phone calls to find the pro\nUm and one of the reasons why you want to find or they're saying compensation to minimize conflicts of interest save a plan or is the only meaning he or she is paid just by you not also by third parties such as a fund company\nUm so this is what a fee based company or ... when I go or they are acting out from a", "show_name": "Family Financial Focus with Paul Welch &

... but it was one of the reasons why was the crash and one of the reasons why\nYou are passionate about having this conversation is because you were able to recognize so many of the elements of things that people just didn't know right you know it was just like just not knowing a term target date fund and how\nIt worked as a man how am I allocated to charge a law says no one's really explaining\nIn detail what does this mean for you\nWrite it up and I think that's the conversation that needs to take place ... is the explanation of what type of investments you know most investors are confused what they actually own right right ... back in that time in two thousand eight when you say target date funds they were\nPretty new at that point and most people do not understand the allocation within those funds themselves when they understood was\nAnd back then if I have I'm going to retire in two thousand ten and um that's my target date fund two thousand ten in the market dropped in two thousand eight\nThey were surprised and shocked at how much they actually the percentage of what they owned and that talk if I was in equities mhm um because a target date fund managers weren't looking at hey you're going to retire and two years\nAnd then only money's going to be in the bank or the money market they're saying hey you got to retire and two years and you know the way they look at that you're going to live another Twenty years of life right right so we need to have a you know still a good percentage of your money in equities for the growth you're going to need to ... retirement ... that was missed\nBy a lot of investors and so when the market you know a lot of investors back in that time\nIt it almost seems like it wasn't ten years ago when I modeling about thirty forty fifty percent yeah of their net worth and especially in their retirement\nMoney yeah and Larry just to reiterate that that was because when somebody has that option of just checking off something in your mind you're going oh a target date fund they must know what they're doing I'll just check here\nWithout really explaining well it's actually planning not on it's gonna be safer when you retire\nBut it's going to be invested in a way that is still quite risky because that's where the ... and you're going to need growth is\nSo there is benefits to target date fund because yes all the\nUm confusion sometimes and investors might have and what they should allocate and therefore one case so\nThe the managers of a target date fund again looking at a group I don't know how many that are in that group is just say you know just make it simple a hundred people in the group and I was hundred people this is how we should allocate someone in today's world\nAnd two thousand Eighteen is going to retire and two thousand twenty similar isn't it\n[laughter] God [laughter] scare 'em\nYou know they're ... manager those sort of looking at a group of people ... and they say okay so it could retire and two thousand and twenty [noise]\nThe average life expectancy for retirees is ex she looks just say I'm just I'm just saying one ear and okay so now we need to manage that money as if they need it for the next Twenty years so they still need a percentage of money inequities\nThat challenge there for investors who choose target date funds especially those who are retiring somewhat early in the next two to five or six years something like that is the group of people that they're\nPutting you into who ... ... what is their situation everybody has a different situation some people are going to retire with a pension some people are not going to retire with a pension if you need eighty thousand dollars a year of income and you have a pension is going to pay you fifty thousand\nThat's quite a bit different than if you need eighty thousand dollars of income and you don't have attention you only have Social Security doesn't twenty five thousand\nSo that difference or twenty five thousand when you when in target date fund they don't know that each of that of each individual\nSituation right they're just going to bring people together so you as the employee the investor need to understand that and then you need to understand what I have in his target date funds from my own purpose in my own personal life forgetting about the other Ninety nine people in that group right wasn't\nThat wasn't the fault of target date fund right was the fault of people not understanding\nUm know what they own and why they own it that's one of our you're saying yeah so I mean a target date fund like Larry said it's it's a fund\nThat the date that the data on the fun is based on when you plan on retiring and they usually based on five years are commensurate with today is the twenty twenty fund and then the twenty twenty five twenty thirty back in two thousand eight\nThe twenty ten fun to just like the twenty twenty fun today like we just mentioned\nBut where people did not understand as they said oh it's two thousand eight I'm retirement and two years I'm On the twenty ten fund so and twenty ten I Need all my money so it must be almost all the money market I have no risk right right and all of a sudden when the market took the fifty percent downturn they will cut their\nFour one K. is or their IRAs or whatever investments they had in these target date funds and wait a minute why is this down so much I thought I Need my money in two years they just didn't understand like Larry mentioned\nThe managers of those target date funds were looking at it not like you need all your money in twenty ten they looked at it like hey you're maybe around eight sixty five we still need to allocate this and a portion of equities and bonds\nBut it's still a pretty fair portion inequities because we need the income when they retire at sixty five plus the growth to keep up with inflation\nAnd um with all that said if they understand if the investor understood that even when I went down Johnny ... if they understood also you know the um the history of the market and understanding even if\nYou retire and twenty ten and even if your portfolio is down even twenty percent which is significant ... you know if you have\nA million dollars and all of a sudden it's eight hundred thousand when you retire but you really you don't eat all your money\nThe day you're going to hire me to start taking out a monthly income and when the portfolio was down you could just take your monthly yet it's not like every you know if you have a portion and ... and ... and a portion and bond funds\nAnd you need monthly income you know what we try to do for our clients just take it from whatever funds are doing the best at the time of course if you have all your eggs in one basket like one target date fund and that's down you have really no\nNo choice but to sell at a loss yeah that's why you know target date funds are okay but it's like the simple way of investing in our opinion um well it depends on the target date funds would do like some of them but um you know we like looking at all the different investment choices and coming up with your own portfolio\nYeah All right so when we get back we'll do a little update on the market and where we can go from here will be back right after this\n[noise] news radio ten thirty and Ninety three

back with family financial focus here on WB Z ten thirty I Am I'm Joni ... Paul and Larry Welsh\nAre here and we're a reflecting back ten years we've been here ... busy about ten years now and I'm looking back I have here where where's and we're still here and not going anywhere and long way to go and are are of course has\nBeen a boy we we was you know baptism by fire as they say when we started it was just like people need information you know we just need to make sure that ah we're dedicated for a couple of hours a week to explain\nThe way the terminology works in the financial industry to hopefully get you to a point where at least you're asking the right questions no matter who you're working with him no matter who you're talking to right where are real focus is to empower you\nTo have the right questions to as you said Larry sometimes the first thing that we need to work on it just figuring out what do I mean what do I need and retirement right you know think about the date comes when you're not going to have that paycheck come there\nAnd I said well too is the so called in I Know\nFinally got to God did say it didn't you know many\nTimes you have complimented on writing just go ahead\nSo anyways is understanding what you own in why won't it might seem so simple to say but it's also very important right right right that's what we find is you know pollen I really do me one of the ... grassroots whatever they call it\nA lot of new people come into our office and we can see that there is confusion still out there yeah and people are not understanding the investments they have and not understanding you know sometimes what they purchase and then that could be like a\nSome type of annuity and what they have in their mind as an income account and as it gets very detail I Want to get into it but they're not understanding\nThe investments that would be properly um [noise]\nI'm Brett brings some synergy to what they need and for their own financial life now and there's just so much marketing out there but so many different types of investments there's confusion and we all have busy wise we just do and many people you know ... that we see are busy with their career\nAnd so it doesn't leave much time in any one week to sit down and kind of go over their investments ... you know they want to sit down and relax on friday and I don't want to sit down and say okay let's get our statements and figure out or the wire\nAnd what the hell we buy and who was that that ... who ten years ago or nine years ago you did something what was that and you know and I again I Am not a financial professional I'm just the person that\nIs like everyone else I'm like yeah I just want to make sure I have enough money to retire and you know I don't know the answers to things that's why I'm happy to be able to uh speak for people like me and will\nCome in to us I just want to make sure I'm OK Paul I weigh on track right that's what it really they don't want to come in by then you're done a yacht well maybe that who [laughter]\nNo but I mean like why are we said earlier it's like I ... well how much do I need when I retire how am I saving enough do I have enough as it invested properly ... these are all the questions and you know without talking about the last ten years have been terrific\nBut then you could say so what what have you done for me lately right or the next ten years yeah for yeah out in the last ten years that's why you know we talk about market today and even get a date I can talk about you know how the market's done yet a date so far this year\nBut in a way I say this all the time when the market's up where it's basically been up here most every you know basically almost every time we talked in the last ten years but um everybody's\nHappy but nobody's satisfied right has it's okay it's up about what's going to happen tomorrow and what you know um retirement and two years\nWhat's gonna happen to the next twenty five thirty years and I have to make sure that I'm okay my spouse was okay if you're married my children are okay so um and then we're in the sandwich generation you know I'm worried about\nI have two children in college and I have my own retirement and I'm helping my my mother wrote financially or she living with me or this elder law care so does you know so much going on with people today that it's it's hard to even take time to\nEven add up how much they have never mind how it's invested\nRight right right well and that's the thing you know as I was saying you can keep looking at your file folders and\nYou know some people don't know the difference between you know equities and a money market and you're like I they just see the bottom line number ... and don't even know how the percentages of what they have the or they see a pie chart and they go\nI think this is correct I don't know why\nYou know I I'm just frustrates me when I hear different even you know different commentators say things like\nOh I think we could be in for a correction and the next quarter I mean even um you might remember last month on August ... before you know I was saying you know I don't like when you competed also temper can be a very volatile much you care for I Would I could be in for corruption twenty percent\nCorruption and um you know you better be cautious but if the\nAverage investor here is that they could make them make a rational and emotional decisions you know the commentator might be thinking oh you know just be careful about investing new money maybe dollar cost averaging put a little bit in an ones but the average investor might say oh if the market's going to go down I just read that on the radio or on the\nTV show I should just sell everything and put it in cash I stopped adding money's my four one K. so you're making irrational um inappropriate in my opinion decisions on your long term portfolio yeah and then if you look at\nKnow just just to interject that when you're bringing up is so important depending on what people say and in this insane mediated world of messaging from social media to television to podcasts\nWe're getting information all over the place to look at just what happened with Tesla wet or know hey I think I got some investors that are going to take a ... like ... people are not understanding what they say yeah well that's an around the other\nThing that's why we say diversification is so important don't put all your eggs in any one basket you know you look at test like good the volatility on that ... different time periods in the last few months versus\nIf you you know if you own the U.S in the five hundred index for an example I'm not saying investing that but I mean you're on a five hundred largest companies in America so\nOne company does poorly the other four Ninety nine de do positively and you're so up right but if you put all your eggs in one basket you know you kind of at the mercy of that one company you could do very well there you could do very poorly but in my opinion you don't want to bet your financial future especially if you're close to retirement\nOn you know just a handful of companies on one company of course nice so um but with all that said even when you talk about the market and we're talking about all the ten year history now and the you know with ten year anniversary with a mock it had a huge decline but\nI I also want to be careful when you say the market because the average investor you know first of all what is the market and second of all you know you're saying the market is the stocks I mean most people don't have a hundred percent of the money in stocks funds you know they may have a certain percentage depending on\nYou know what they show some people don't even know what they chose say and therefore one K. you know if they choose a target date fund while yeah that means depending on the target date if it's a twenty twenty is going to have less than ... and a twenty thirty fund because it means you you know you're going to retire ten years earlier ten years later\nSo um you know what we say stay with your long term objective so\nIf you had the appropriate portfolio objective but at the beginning of this year depending on whether your retirement and two years you just retired or you've been retired for five years you're not retiring until ten or Fifteen Years\nIt's all a matter of how much inequities and how much in bonds but you stay with that long term objective that's how philosophy no matter what the news is no matter what the market cycles I Would no matter what the fair market out there\nBut you don't have to just\nLook at it and when the market's down just say oh that's too bad I guess I just have to wait or when the market's up say oh that's great but I Wonder if that's going down what we say is stay with the long term objectives but addressed the market cycles when the market's down well maybe that's a good time to actually\nTrim some of the bonds that are not down and buy more stock funds while they're down by the discount\nEvery other part of like people get that accept this their investments that\nWe've had this conversation so many times and it's it is amazing that this is the one area that you don't understand when the market's down it's like a ...\nIt's like you know if you look at it like real estate you buy a house a two family home in um whatever in Medford mhm and you get rental income and get paid four hundred thousand dollars so that to family home and yet you're making twenty thousand a year and rent mhm and then a year later\nReal estate market goes down if you want to sell that four hundred thousand dollar home while you couldn't sell it for more than three fifty but people don't say oh I'm Down to fifty thousand they say well not selling who cares\nAnd to put at even a at another spectrum\nIf the house next door one for sale for three fifty it might be saying jeeze that's a bargain I paid for a hundred dollars and another one for three fifty and get the same rent my butt so people get it and other parts of life our mortgage rates and things like that or people will probably driving home from school right now saving on paper towels because the down in price might go into\nSome other stores but um\nBut with your own investments I think it's because you just think of it as dollars you don't really think of it at different assets inside your portfolio ... that people don't really see that\nMuch so that but that's our job that's what we do for our clients and even you know and now you know if you trim you know if you buy when the market's down stay with your long term objectives but just to add more to the equities\nBut now like you had a day like I said you know the S. and P. as up about nine percent at the end of September the Dow Jones up about seven so that's just different indexes but basically you know the stock market's up well\nIf you are allocation as say sixty percent equities in forty percent bonds or maybe since the market's up you have a heavy awaiting inequities cause they're up like so what we say is well maybe it's a good time to rebalance from some of those equities\nThat are ... that you at the recent gains and put them into the bonds that are less well too so then if the market goes down over the next few months you already kind of took some of your profits mhm but yet you didn't get all enter all out so that's that's the real value\nRight and I think that's the most critical thing to understand is that you can't just you know the days of what did you call it buying hold you buy something and you're just spy and when we agree\nWith that by on hold but not just look at it by on hold and then address the market cycles bribery balancing and it's not as simple as just a portfolio is Thomas going yeah right\nYou know it's not just rebounded well looking at the investments and are they doing well compared to other ones and change an hour waiting at the national small cap and cabinet as a

B. C. news our\nSay for your own retirement if you're not receiving a pension or even if you are\nUm but then you're also dealing with the emotional aspect is um you know with the market's down oh you know should I keep putting my money in that I make a change so you're you're losing sleep at night first of all how much you're putting in and second of all is it invested correctly and the market cycles like we've been talking about\nUm then what happens now Joni with new people coming into the U.S\nIs still even say you know I remember ten years ago when the market crashed and\nIt really didn't affect me that much because I was saying well hey I got ten or Fifteen Years I'll make it up but I remember my co workers that were retiring soon and they were\nTerrified right now I'm retiring soon I don't want to be terrified Paul how I I'm not sure how I should be allocated I'm not sure if I'm On track I'm not sure if I'm taking on too much risk but I also want to make sure that I\nGet the growth I Need ... so that's you know what we do for a new people coming in and of course our current clients is just the whole financial plan\nHow much you have now how much you contributing what that can grow to in the future when you retire how much income you can pull from that what do you receive and from other sources\nUh we put inflation on that and with the income you ... your withdrawing on a annual basis when you retire\nUm you know basically the number one question people lab and what we're showing them is does your money last as long as you do write you know we say it you know you don't need a million dollars at age a hundred but you don't want to run out at age eighty to ... you know that's the the whole question there so these retirements studies that we um [noise]\nPrepare for the people coming in and for our current clients they find a lot of value on it because like Larry says and she's I never really sat down and saw the numbers like this if I if we keep doing what we're doing we're more than on track right\nUm but that's just again it's it's a retirement study or really every time a projection or every time a plan\nBut with any plan you got to work the land mines so that's just the beginning but then you know you become our client we we worked to plan first of all how do we set up the portfolio for the growth rates that we're project and in second of all how do we address the market cycles like duck will likely talked about\nAnd then um you know with our clients we like to get together with them regularly you know at least once a year or so and say okay you know we when when we get together we update their retirement studies okay this is how much\nYou had last year and this is um you know now that sat up everything this year and then we look at the projection how you doing better than projected a worse than projected\nIf you're doing better hey we're better than on track and you're doing worse than why is that are you not saving as much as you said as a portfolio not performing as projected at least you can address at now\nOh then rather it's not like instead of doing these ah production and say okay I'll see you in ten years like you know you've got to work the plant\nA lot of times people just don't even know what that's all about you know I don't know how what do you mean work the plan because I I okay I'm supposed to be adding money but you know what is wonder why you know\nRight well the average investor Joni they're not going to [noise]\nYou know ... some do but for the hours invested ... understand how do you put a plan to get right right that's why they take the advice of someone like us advisors you know we're independent investment advisors but there's plenty\nOf planners and that can be you know did you can go and sit down with [noise] and go through that whole process and everyone does it a little different way\nAnd we have our own way of doing something right and you know it's not that we put a hundred percent of our money's clients in stock or a hundred percent of my clients money in ... whatever it might be but we take our time\nWhen people come in and we go through a whole process and we understand\nYou know where they are at what they are trying to accomplish what their investments and then\nWith all that information then we put together all these investments we believe are appropriate for you to own mhm because we spent that time and understand what you're trying to accomplish and your financial world mhm it's just too many times that we see is people are compulsive I think and they have little time to do things and so\nIt's they still have that fear\nDo I have enough money for retirement and they looking for the easy way out so to speak or hearing\nSome of the marketing that's going on like Paul said before the fear of that they use fear marketing like hey you might run out of money you should buy this financial products right and um they might be tempted to to go ahead and buy that financial product and might not understand everything about is\nJust being honest 'cause ... again one of the grassroots we see it right and so I purchased is two years ago because I I was fearful the market\nBecause I heard a commercial and I got to run out of money so you need to buy this financial products will plug into it's\nAlso being marketed as this one thing so when you're talking about we've got a plan to work you need stocks you need bonds you need principle protected you need this people all of a sudden go well I don't know how to do all of that so if you have one thing and somebody tells you just by this one thing and you'll be ...\nConsider the source because some of the sphere marketing it's it's amazing that\nThey're actually happy when the market goes down it's like when the market's up it's like whoa sooner or later the market may go down you might run out all your money you need to invest in something that you're not going to lose the money but then when the market's down like hey I told you the market was going to go down and you need to invest in something that you you don't want to lose anymore right so\nUm but that type of fear marketing usually gets just offering one type of product and it's really putting the product instead of putting up putting a plan together\nAnd you know they're offering all kinds of bells and whistles with income guarantees and all that but uh we'll\nJust think of the words that their use\nYou're guaranteed income share you know don't lose the money so what we say his forget all that come up with inappropriate plan for yourself\nAnd then you can kinda interpret what all these different investments can do for you or you can even kind of interpret when you hear these different market commentaries are different commercials about different types of investments\nAnd I and I would only just just when I you know talking to my friends are ... and I'm explaining the stuff that I've learned from you\nMy friends all of a sudden we'll come back to me and they're like ah they feel empowered they're like yeah I heard dot comers I knew exactly what they were talking about I read it but you didn't before we had our conversation did you and they're like no they make it sound so good\nLike that commercial you educated consumers are best customer and we are as yeah you know there are many of those financial products out there and some of them are really good and it would be appropriate for you to have somebody in one of the\nYou know you you think about your your you have a hundred percent of your money don't put too much in any one place like ... what happens is if you have what'd you say an agent that is selling these type of products\nThey're making commissions mhm so I'm not saying that would you know if there'll be happy that you put more than less so they're gonna make a logic commission right you know so you're just is nothing wrong with\nHer mission but you just need to understand those products and make sure that the price of it for you and don't just get one for advice get multiple if I start we'll be right back [noise]\nNever know what's going to get

and Larry Welsh and here's your host ...\nAnd our back with family financial focus here on ... ten thirty am I'm ... piling Larry well chair here and uh\nI think we we now know how you guys work [laughter] I was going to run down and I I think that's really nice to know that that literally it's going to be like hey we'll see for our second meeting in for the third and we're here and I like Paul sign you always say we're ready when you're ready\nTo go we we actually said um you know this is at the end result of all that\nIs again you hope you we hope that they would like to become a client but you should take this you should go um interview other planners you know and then you go with who you feel most confident and there's got to bring the best value to your situation obviously you know you always it's\nNot just okay the transparency and how they're compensated and how they're going to help you but also you want to feel comfortable communicating with them you don't feel emitted or if they're talking over your head I mean that doesn't help you that's your money you should feel confident about\nAnyone right I mean after if you decided to be one of our clients then obviously and our investment advisory were not receiving any commissions were getting paid along the way it's my explain right now\nSo the idea here is we want to give the best service that we can give and it's not just pollen I sit in an office we have a whole staff night right or some people do some do we have to um younger twin brothers were also investment visors and\nUm so the money gets actively\nManaged it's not it's not passive and\nQuickly explained that 'cause you said at a few times when we've done it in many\nShowing a soda and foundational relationship I guess if you're using a broker like Paul explained earlier British to represent our angel planner and the way they are getting compensated is upfront commission so you invest money they make a commission up front so the question always becomes well how much time is going to be spent\nOn the management of my accounts if you if you already made your money [laughter] right right I mean you just think about it in a business sense right\nAnd so in what commissioner you are you making and what can I expect going forward like Paul explain as a transaction Mike with us it's totally different there is no upfront commission were getting paid along the way so we actively manage our clients accounts because in the first if you're paying someone up front for the commission which is fine that's what you want\nIs just so you they might put you in five or six different mutual funds that could be two or three mutual fund families and so when it comes time to rebalance six months from now if they're taking money from one mutual funds ... family and put it in another mutual fund family because that's what the allegation is calling for while they're going to make a new commission because it's going from one\nCompany to another company and so that type of relationship is more commission driven\nAnd it's again transaction like Paul explain and there's no fight ... responsibility of managing that money\nBut is that that's that's not the same as active manager\nRight active management is is different there is no commissions up front\nWe charge a one percent annual fee it comes out of our clients that points to five percent on a quarterly basis\nSo every quarter after the quarter we send our clients so to speak like a letter mhm wish I'm exactly what's being taken out for our feet and it's also on their child swab statement [laughter] okay so it's completely transparent they know it\nSo he became our client today it could be you know six months from now we're rebalancing your account because he equities have done well let's just say some of the ANC and lost some of the games the equities and put them into the bonds\nAre unfortunately the equity was went down we can be selling some bonds and buying equity is way down in value okay but that just happened\nSo that's what you're constantly dealing you're keeping an eye on yeah constantly monitoring\nThe portfolios but we're only going to rebalance Johnny if we think it's going to help you were not going to do it just to show hey we balance right rise all we want our clients to do is do well right and we're not going to just make a transaction just to make it look good because of our clients\nMoney goes down our revenue goes down if I ... when he goes up I revenue 'cause we're only going to make a change if it helps our clients because it helps us\nOkay so explain a little bit just if you had this actively managed diversified portfolio\nOver the past decade now let's we'd seen because we didn't expect the market to do what it it's stealing the growth of the world so you're constantly when it keeps going up while it's your time over the last\nTen years we decided to rebalance our clients portfolio when the stocks like I said earlier this evening\nHey if they're you know of our clients allocation\nObjective is Seventy percent equities and thirty percent bonds well of course if you just kept the equities for the last ten years you'd be probably Ninety five five now because he said the equities kept going up right so the idea is to trim the equities over time and in allocate those gains into the bonds or you stay with that Seventy thirty is not just that simple but we're also looking at\nYou know how much waiting should we have an international at certain time periods versus um you know the U.S economy how much we haven't lodge kept stocks mid cap stock so much should we have a long term bone structure and bonds government bonds I mean there's a whole\nScience behind our portfolio management it's not just old Seventy thirty it's you know there's a whole strategic portfolio set up and you're doing all the work we're doing on work and it's not just\nIn the other thing is we um we have no allegiance to the investments are even to Schwab are legion swat clients in other words\nIf you've been our clients will last ten years\nYou know some of the mutual funds and exchange traded funds we had ten years ago we don't have today because if we felt they weren't performing as well as other funds were going to sell that and by the other one mhm 'cause we can we use and no commission funds though it doesn't cost our clients any any commission to buy one funded by another phone\nIn if we feel it's going to help our clients that also helps us so it's a real partnership I mean it's really all we want our clients to do is do well\nAnd where we're really believe that a diversified portfolio and our opinion is going to bring better results and so you need a percentage in equities you need a percentage and bonds and percentage in principle protected are constantly manage all that\nBut that's quite a bit different than what we were talking about I guess in the last segment yeah if you go to a broker which is fine but you know what I hear the word broker\nIt's always like well I Want to buy purchased a stock like there's a good stock there it's and it's down in value it's a good by let's do it\nAnd that's fine it's grace there's nothing wrong with that but then don't do it themselves 'cause I ... yeah brokers or you know they could they could assist you and they give you their opinion on different stocks and you should purchase in good times to buy it and sell it\nIt was just re value with her on us out saying they're ... I mean what you're looking for a different relationship but then sometimes\nYou wouldn't have to go and saying this is what I'm looking right well I I Know about\nYour own a golf course and your golfing and yet ... says oh I got a hot stock I call my broker and see if that's a hot stock or not I'll call you broke a what do you think about the stock yeah it's a good by okay let's do it okay that's like a broker right I mean that's what I think of them I Want to broker\nBut but then you know sometimes what we see is there is a you know a life insurance agent that selling I knew it was just a commission based type of products and sometimes they come in and people do not exaggerating sometimes it's three or four or five hundred thousand dollars\nAnd they put it all into one financial product ah and then there with the with these people don't understand they didn't ask is first of all what ... what is the agent receiving for a commission did you did you find out I don't know we don't have any idea\nAnd what is this you know how does this whole account work well I remember how it generally work but I remember all of it you know so I I just firmly believe that if you got to work with an advisor who ever it is you should understand how they're being compensated uh-huh so if I put four hundred thousand dollars in this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Family Financial Focus

B. C. news radio ten thirty where the news was never saw\nThe news time six o'clock at sixty degrees cloudy and Boston turning chilly tonight with a lower forty to traffic of weather together coming up I'm Garofalo POW easy news our top story I have is our state police are investigating a tragedy on the north shore WB Xi's Karen regal has details\nTwo three four opinions and where\nAnd they just make up they assigned something or they purchase something or they do something they make an irrational um decision on something that's eerie bocce ball that\n... they take Fifteen they call I guess this is I guess\nI guess this is what time is you know and say even told me families are trying to accomplish things maybe um\nProtect assets a gift or whatever it might be ... and sometimes good intentions turned out to be the wrong results like hey we want to protect our house will just gifted to our son right but that could be a benefit in one way but a disaster in another way right\nRight so the only the only way I'm gonna I'm gonna give you all these scenarios okay just in the course of a week I've been a host too and I can say well hang on let me [laughter]\nThis is what I think let me double check and we'll talk about it Saturday Night so I have people tuning in right now on board I said I Will have your answer on Saturday Night on the radio\nWhat we do we feel a lot of situations with families especially those who would you say fifty eight sixty two years old to retire within you know several years and and that's they are going to retire in ... years so they have a lot of questions\nAnd like Paul explain some of those questions could be how do we protect some of our assets because we obtained this wealth ... we want to protect us wealth and how do we go about that how do we set up our\nUm investments to supply the needs we're gonna have to maintain financial independence for the rest of our like ... and we don't want to make any irrational decisions we don't want to make quick decisions we want to do the right thing um [noise] you know because they've probably many people in one way or another by the time you reach the age sixty have been hurt [laughter]\nYou know they've had their challenges they've had taken advice and both in a good side and the bad side and so you know you live live long enough and then you become wider and wider as you go along also [laughter] hopefully and you want to do that in any arena mhm in your life and you you could take any um [noise]\nPlace right now that let's say for an example buying real estate mhm if you're buying real estate right now you feel pressure\nYou go look at a home now and there's ten of the people looking at the same home and you know they're ready to put a down payment on that home or I'll I'll pay cash for it mhm so you're under pressure you don't know what's in the pipes you don't know if the water system works right you don't know if they eat works right you know if the roof\nNeeds repair which any addict or you know you've got ten minutes to make a decision or someone else was going to buy that house before your life that is pressure yeah\nWhat do they call that formal right fairy I said oh I was in the stock market that has yet to end before before it keeps going up\n... you start timing the market and you'd be under the pressure every single day why he's right because it's hard to make the right decisions like you could say I got to get all my money out of the market today 'cause I think there's gonna be a major correction and the next month or so might you might be right\nYou might be wrong ... and if you're wrong then when you put the money back in the market goes up another five percent and you're sitting on the sidelines still\nSo we believe a better approach is to look at it you know in a long term objective and make sure you're allocated you know in a means that wherever the market's going down you don't have all your money and the stock my at the market's going up you have enough\nIn the stocks to provide the growth so you're going to need to keep up with inflation so it's important to understand what your objective is and the closer you get to retirement your objective changes it's no longer I'm forty years old I'm fifty years old and I want to obtain wealth\nSo that I'm going to have enough in my nest egg for retirement\nIf you're close to retirement that objective is now over your objective is to maintain financial independence for the rest of your life is I Try to beat the market a time the market to get credit games it is to maintain that financial independence so that's different for everyone some of us retire and we have\nYou know you could take 'em [noise]\nLooks example for two teachers ... they might not have a lot of money put away um because they've had their career where they enjoy their teaching but it doesn't provide as much you know income as maybe some other careers but what they do have is tensions mhm so if you take your husband and wife and they've been teaching for the last Thirty years when they retire their pensions\nCould just about to take care of all their income nice so that they don't need a million dollars and the bank right right but if you retire and have a million dollars in the bank and you retain that wealth\nAnd the only source of income you have a Social Security and you need you know more than double what your Social Security is for your own financial independence while you need that million dollars to provide that income for you you're in a different situation mhm so everyone has their own challenges in regards to how do we invest for the future\nBut before you can make the decision to where you actually invest and that's what you're talking about my job to care for all you have to look at it in a holistic point of view and understand what what are you trying to accomplish\nAnd didn't understand that first what am I going to need from for income and my retirement how am I going to invest this money and then you know uh for my guys we get all that information we do a whole analysis and then\nAfter all that analysis two or three meetings then we're proposing would investments you should have so you don't want to make quick decisions\nAre sometimes what we see is a people come into office and and they've been you know wherever else that might be and they felt pressure to buy some type of financial product are to invest in something but they didn't feel comfortable with but\nThe the the um [noise] person on the other side of the table the advisor they felt pressure because they just they just felt like they were trying to sell something so you shouldn't feel pressure in anything to do it in life give it time and make the right decision\nAnd and have that elevated conversation and what I'm hearing you just say now is you start off with you are the ones questioning the people that you're talking to rather than you know them asking you ... you're saying well we need to know what your objectives are and we have to start with that\nBecause everyone has different scenarios you know and everybody\nYou were saying life can be messy and all of a sudden what you thought you know your life was going to be when you start\nThat this off all of a sudden you're like yeah the divorce cost me that\nWell okay you know so we're all in different scenarios life gets in a way of life right right right so we really want to start off with an individual conversation to meet your needs to be the best place to start All right we'll be back with got a great show for night for tonight I'm Glad you're with us we'll be right back\n[noise] news radio ten thirty and Ninety three financial a perfect combination for the

back with family financial focus here on WB easy ten thirty AM I'm Tony ... and ... ... joined us here every Saturday Night and it was just saying on the commercial like I cannot believe how smart I got\n[laughter] has hears that I've been talking I feel good to feel like me [laughter] as long as you might feel so smart well\nYou know what and I I I Am so amazed that some of these things that I feel that people expect\nThis to be in their their knowledge base you know I'm a professional I Am a nurse I'm a teacher I Am a you know I'm an engineer or of course I should know how to do my finance I should be able to know how to plan for retirement\nBut the industry changed so fast and it was never about making sure that what the financial world was putting out there\nIt was really the intention was not to have a well informed consumer subtitled feels like that yeah I Know I Know you're nicer than I Am I'm like\nThe wall Street Journal ... your life\nHas your wealth and especially if you're not receiving a pension you know wherever you're saving on your retirement programs or whether it's\nUm you know nonprofits and you've got the four o three bees or ... or for fifty seven is whatever it is\nThat is what if you add up you know whatever you accumulate that is your pension and it's just amazing how people say oh I should be able to do this on my own but yet if you make a mistake it could be catastrophic because there's your your retirement\nAnd anything else in your life if there's a medical issue with you you know because oh I'll just look it up and take care of myself farms hey my electrical\nUm why aren't in the house needs to repair I'll just go to Home Depot and my some some clubs [laughter] you know I go to hire an electrician or end up um electrocuted myself\nBut with the financial world is just people expected it understand it but it's um it's like you said it's overwhelming\nAnd it's because it's not our knowledge base and so what happens is sometimes people find somebody well we went in and we\nWell we ... we have to pay this person you know twenty five hundred bucks up front to three thousand dollars up front and they are going to give us our financial plan because we really don't know how to do it ourselves and then they're like well they told us to do well there are way going\nI don't feel right right I mean literally just into just than that it's like oh but we have to we have to pay them the rest of the I'm like ... see paid the money you don't feel right it didn't feel right to you\nLike ... mindset now if I have to go back and pay him a second I'm like you don't have to do anything like that I don't feel right\nYeah it's funny how when you well it's just like when you go to the doctor I but I Do what they tell me\nMy ... and so if you go into a financial professional what's it's it's overwhelming just understanding all the different types of investments and how do you take out income when you retire and what type of and you know should I have mutual funds exchange traded funds individual stocks bonds whatever\nBut then you go seek out a professional and like I was saying before the break those different types of professionals and the average person has no idea who they are dealing with and how they're being paid and what they can offer\nSo I'm In that situation like you're from there if they went and met with a a financial fresh you know I mean some shoes to charge a financial planning the upfront and\nAnd so you pay them but it's not like\nEvery professional does that but people probably just don't know that I find I'm like I was saying before the break the different types of licenses you know a I'm a broker really as a registered representative of a brokerage firm and um you know that's what they call a suit ability license\nAnd then we talked about as an investment advisor license that stuff I Do Sherry to the client and that's what we are here in our investment advisory as I Do Sherry and I'm\nIn the other type of license is what they call just an insurance agent license and that's the offer you know in the ... in the financial world that's the offer um annuities are life insurance or long term care insurance but basically those are mostly commission base and it's under the insurance state insurance regulators so\nNo they're not only from advisors who are always looking at it from the perspective\nThat you want to have your money for the most part you want to have your money I I don't want to lose any money so you know they sell insurance\nProducts are usually Olin with money you know but um you know went out for him here we're an investment advisory firm and like I said as a ah if I Do sharing and we do the fee based planning and [noise] excuse me losing my voice here but as an investment advisor I'm\nAs a fee based at most one of the most important parts of that name as we advise\nWe don't hold your money that's another question you want to ask if you're going to a professional where where's my money going to be held in my opinion you want it to be held at a ... you know a well known from that you feel comfortable with and we use you know one of the most well known friends out there is Charles Schwab\nSo our clients that they want our help we open up Charles Schwab accounts right our office you know whether it's an IRA or joined account of trust account or whatever it might be\nSo your money is at Schwab\nYou got the comfort of knowing your money's worth the big from you could just statements from ... to go on Schwab dot com no people come on or off as the looking on the ... right on the phone ... um but you get the hands on advice in the act of management from us mice so it's like you get their hands on personal advice but you just you know you got the comfort of knowing your money's\nWith the big from 'em\nSo with that said um you know that's as an investment adviser and then a few in a as our insurance um you know we're also an insurance agency because sometimes we could do a great job growing your money but if you do need some protection or if you need life insurance or\nIf you're looking forward to put a portion of your money in in a um [noise] financial vehicle that has no risk somebody maybe do a little bit better than the bank then those are insurance products ... you know as I\nAs a producer we tell our clientele you if you want us to implement this insurance product for you then we're going to receive a commission we tell them how much the commission is we everything's totally transparent we just want to make sure they get what they need my a\nRestoration that we've heard over the years joining we've been doing this for over twenty five years now so we do have some experience but you know there's more in the marketplace now than ever has been before for best friends in financial products there just is\nAnd that's good that is a very good thing and plenty for retirement is you have so many different opportunities now it's an adventure\nAnd you should enjoy it [laughter] you don't want to be bogged down with you know all what we've just been discussing I Hope I get the right investments in ... and I hope I have the right and visor and all that but the frustration that pollen I hear over the years is a number one I Would say is people feel like when they go see certain types of\nUm independent agents are financial planners\nSometimes not all the time but sometimes I feel like they're being pressured into buying some type of financial products are being pressured to um invest in some type of mutual fund whatever it might be and you know so you have to ask yourself as a consumer good thing for you to understand\nIs that okay if I'm going to pay the person on the other side of the table the advisor\nIn upfront commission that's fine as long as I understand my mission they're making I understand that as a transaction [laughter] and I'm not expecting them to manage just money going forward because it was a transaction right\nAnd you know and in reality there are very good honestly very good brokers liners that do keep up with things and they helped their clients and its great life but they make that up front commission so the ... the incentive\nAn all types of situations and questions come up and review meetings and it could be like Paul mentioned ... should a downsized so many people ... you know who are are at that stage or if he we decided to downsize we're selling our property and we're going to buy a place in Florida are all going to buy a condo or whatever it might be and\nSo we're talking about that the next question should be what types of trust that I have to avoid you know probing and and to avoid or eliminate you know a state taxes\nAnd the next question could be I have a daughter just graduated\nIn college and we want to buy her a gift or this money for it to do it it's so that's just that's just you know ongoing management so\nSee we're looking at a spreadsheet and just numbers and investments you're taking into lifestyle and what's happening in some like the reality is helpful\nYou have a an unusual life actually my background is managing the portfolio but it's helping them with everything right and I said it's not just because we do have numbers we have graphs we show them in yeah clearly what the performer Chinatown mhm are after review meanings I mean it was like a ... there's a there's a graph this is your money you started you know seven and a half years ago\nAnd this is this is the growth of your money ...\nDone it on one of the other most I guess one of the uh common comment we get from New people coming in and saying you know I've\nI've had this little account here for I don't know how long are I've been working with the same advisor for twelve years and I asked him you know how we actually done you know as far as performance over the years oh well you made changes here and then we we open this account of clothes Atacama we change this investment so we can't really give you an exact\nBut I I don't agree with that because like why are we just said when our clients come in for a review meeting whether they've been with us for\nA seven month so seven years ... they they um [noise] the reports that we give them show them exactly how much they burn from day one like how much you know what they started with or you know even after withdrawals or if they've been out and contributions but it shows pure performance\nFrom day one like what you ... get a date from January till today what you averaged over the last one year three year five year Mars since you've been with us so it's nice to see that\nHey I'm about what you have to realize as this 'cause I think what goes on with many um [noise] a consumer is that says that who am I\nYou know here I Am going to get ready to retire and two years and I have you know eight hundred thousand dollars in my four oh one K. and I got a couple of hundred thousand dollars in the bank and you know altogether we got this money but you you you feel like a you know just the sand in the seashore ...\nBut you wouldn't believe the marketing that goes behind just the marketing you see on TV is one thing but behind all that all these different firms in Wall Street and insurance companies and different advisory groups the amount of attention they would give\nFor each individual four one Kay Allen because everybody wants when you retire they want to take management of that for a woman and behind the scenes pollen I get emails constantly every single day from all these marketing firms on you know how go about\nYou know talking to a consumer which had to obtain management over four one K. or to sell some type of financial products for four one K. we don't we don't pay attention to any of it [laughter] yeah I'm telling you that is what how important you are wow you were listening right now you are very important to Wall Street\nMarketing companies insurance companies they put a tremendous amount of marketing behind the management of hopefully\nAble to have you transfer your role over your four one K. to one of their

C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never saw\nSomebody made the news times seven o'clock we've got fifty eight degrees partly cloudy skies in Boston turning chilly tonight with a little forty two trafficking whether together coming up I'm Garofalo BMW busy news our top story out this hour\nAnd if you just picked out a few companies from that us and the five hundred list just pick out a few states McDonald's Coca Cola and Raytheon so um if McDonald's stock goes down last week which is I went down in value\nYou know and you won't McDonald stock is part of your portfolio\nWell I I don't believe McDonald's is going out of business now\n... I I just don't think that's going to happen I think people are gonna still eat hamburgers I must say [laughter] you can have a hamburger and a very healthy economy and you might eat a few more hamburgers and an economy that's not doing so well my McDonald's is one of those types of stocks\nWhere you wouldn't you wouldn't think the guy go into business just because the value of the stock went down the share price and in fact the share price went down those companies those type of companies tend to pay a lot of different and so if you have dividend reinvest and you're actually when that happens you're actually buy more shares of the same stock while I was down in value because when I go down\nAnd you automatically reinvest it while it was down to\nDefeat and got paid and brought more shares is loud on okay so when it goes back up again you're rewarded for that mhm so that in my opinion is a better situation on those type of stocks and it is to you the way I explained it in a meeting as you're driving up and down one twenty eight or Ninety three or route one\nAnd you see a sign on the side of the road and it says Coca Cola you say I Know who they are mhm yeah a Proctor and gamble I Know who they are my but who stay aside and said you know John and Mary's whatever on the side of a building\nManufacturing you used to I have no idea what they're manufacturing inside that building I just have no idea that could be like a small kept company it could be a very successful company it could be doing very well\nAnd it was an investor you might make a better than\nThan a larger company mhm but you're taking on more risk because it's it's not the size of Coca Cola my you're safe so it's important in every main era you as the investor understand what you're trying to accomplish so you don't want to have too much waiting in stock too much waiting and bonds or too much waiting in principle protected accounts\nSo in the markets are ball 'til they had been over the last couple of weeks or so then you can say well you know what the stocks went down but I didn't have a hundred percent of my money in stock on purpose [laughter]\nAre you going to say when the stocks go up and say well you know I didn't I it was just talks of going out you say I Wish I had a hundred percent on Monday and stock but I don't want to take that type of risk so it's having an application\nFor you as an individual what investments should you have based on what you're trying to accomplish for your own retirement which is financial independence\nAnd you know we do this show to get lessons like that because so many times we just don't even know we hear these terms\nOh bonds and socks and large can I I think I'm supposed to know all that and when you were just explaining all that Larry sometimes people feel like well I I think I'm supposed to be doing this and I don't know what I'm doing so I won't do anything because I don't really know how it all work\nI'm just very impressed with Larry\nI you know but I and I explained\nYou know to to people and we we tell everyone here you know when you sit down or when you have this this is what you end up to what you hear is what you get although when you come in and meet with you guys you usually do it on the white board while you're very or individual more individual and you're explaining it and I understand and we're just\nGiving general knowledge with the airwaves here and even ... it's like we can go one step further Larry mentioned oh yeah you you know large cap stock McDonalds and Coca Cola and Raytheon\nAnd have the evidence reinvest in the same company ... because McDonalds not going out of business but you go to even be careful saying that life will just went out of business\n... went bankrupt last week [laughter]\nRight right oh here's isn't going\nOut of business and this new company called Amazonian is out of that kind of the rain forest Seattle and books by um [noise]\nSo you know the other very important um piece of the puzzle when our opinion is don't put all your eggs in any one investment don't put all your eggs in like individual stocks our philosophy is diversification so rather than\nJust owning Sears that went bankrupt or even look at a company like General Electric you know Twenty years ago gee how can you go wrong when she and all of a sudden now the G was kicked off the Dow Jones been because and you know it's actually gone up quite a bit recently but it was down like fifty percent of a one year like last month\nSo I'm you know opinion you want to diversify in what we use our mutual funds and exchange traded funds that whole many individual positions you know instead of owning two or three starch own hundreds of stocks or one company does poorly the other\nThree hundred four hundred or whatever you know make up for the idea of investing in\nUm securities whether it's bonds of stocks it's really for the objective of that part of the market was you're investing in stocks to get long term growth\nUm you can do that with one stock and maybe get a ride but you could get it wrong you know like GE or ... but if your overall objective is to hey I Want the the growth of the market in our opinion invest in a well diversified portfolio quality stocks of quality mutual funds that old and stocks\nThat way you got the objective of the market without taking on the risk of individual physicians\nDo you feel that way and the people that you're working with one on one when they actually come to that understanding of the plan like\nOh I ... I now I get all ... now I Know when I'm dealing\nThat that is the thing the understanding is the thing that allows them to feel more at\n... people come in for the first meeting and\nI'm just thinking of you know you always taken in the past week and that to you know my co workers say I should have this much money by the time I retire and oh my coworkers semi formal case it or burn this month she had a date 'em as didn't do that\nAnd I'm like well guess what you're not you're co worker you know let's worry about you and your family and your spouse and it's so easy to get off track about what everybody else is doing and of course everybody\nAn expert about your own finances instead of worrying about themselves you know so I like um so what do we want to do is say OK let's look at you what are your objectives on what type of portfolio is appropriate for you and what are you are when companies when you retire\nAnd then we'll come up with the real number is ... and that's when you know you should feel more comfortable and more more on track with yourself because you got your own plan not what everybody's telling you should have mhm\nYeah All right we've got more coming up right after this [noise]\nYou never know what's going to get with the promise you one thing we were five [laughter] oh yeah I don't I\nCan show you the movies or TV and general information fifty thousand was Morgan Oregon I Love your show it's such a pleasure to talk of\nI Love this microphone I Love talking to you is your the faster Morgan show more than ... wife here on WB news radio ten thirty [noise]\nHello we're Paul and Larry well from the Ninety three financial group and host of family financial focus hurt Saturday evening at six pm here on WB they\nWent well let's take a moment and talk about for one k.'s and retirement planning\nBall the traditional pension plans offered by employers are becoming something of the past many now just offer for one case putting more responsibility on the employees to secure their financial future\nThat trade Larry's important to remember that four one K. accounts may be the main source of income during your retirement years\nThat's why many are saying I really need to pay attention this time I only have a few years left before I retire\nHow many years of income your four one K. or IRA provide are they invested properly\nFor answers to these questions and more call Ninety three financial group an eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three or four that's eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three or four it's tied to create a new plan for your retirement for more information including their disclosure visit Ninety three F.

financial focus and with Paul and blurry Welsh and use your host ... on it\nWe're back with family financial focus here on WB easy ten thirty am I I'm Tony ... and pollen Larry Welsh you're here and I'm One of the things I really like about this conversation is it's really practical this is such a difficult conversation a because sometimes\nYou know you were saying it earlier all of a sudden people are just talking over your heads yeah and you know let me drop some knowledge on my financial literally you know when they're talking about things and you know they're talking down to you\nSometimes when you tolerate people or even listen to them on TV or radio all the experts and that ... and ... and the whole thing is well let's talk like this because then I'm going to have people think I'm really what gets Martin\nAnd then they're not going to know what the heck I'm Talking about but they'll go well I guess she knows what she's talking about I guess I never do it it sounds like he knows who knows yeah and I think that's sometimes as one of the things that\nThat happens but again you know since I've been doing this I get very very passionate when I start to hear about somebody I Know that might do something that I Know is in Iraq\nBold decision ... without having talked to three or four different professionals because a lot of times people come I don't have time to talk to\nA lot of people I'm already talking to this guy ... already gave them this soldier well they're they're they're an elder attorney they must know what they're talking about but I'm like you have to get a second opinion so\nI don't know it's amazing like the look at your like your four one K. you worked forty years of your life Thirty years ago life whatever it is saving saving saving and you're going to make a Fifteen minute decision on where to roll that overall is the best thing with an hour and going to be invested so that's\nWhat we're saying the and the you know the last segment of the show is if you're feeling pressure like someone's trying to sell you something and our opinion and you should just hold off right you know the world isn't going to change because you don't make that decision that day or without Waco that month you know you should go\nAnd and for all of us in any area of life especially financial area right because yeah you you need your wealth to maintain financial independence my right before you make any major decisions are purchased or invest in any you know major way you should you should get\nYou know advice in opinions before you make that decision to seek out two or three planets down with them you\nKnow you're at higher domain right when I go in and if they knew that telling me I Need for new tires and then somebody goes I talk to my guy and then you\nGuys like yeah now you only need to uh you know and I and you're like oh you know and then it's like oh it's pretty evident but\nYou know like say you're talking about your your nest it yeah I mean yeah you've worked Thirty years accumulated wealth don't make any quick decisions if you sit down with two or three plan as you you should have a good idea of who you feel comfortable with ... and have them do their own analysis each independently and then you sit down with them yes it takes some time yeah\nBut we're talking about your ... your whole life take the time\nYou know you don't have to do it all in a week it could be done over a couple of months and then you get\nYou go with who you feel comfortable and confident and\nWho you feel is going to have your best interest in in you know actively managed accounts going forward because\nThe advice isn't just for now it's for now in going forward my so life is life and chain and changes and for you know many of our clients were meeting them once or twice a year and things in their life changes and that could give a reason why we\nI might change the allocation the way we're investing the money or the way that money is being distributed on a monthly basis because of taxation or\nUm you know it could be talking about\nSaving on taxes by having the right trust or we could be talking about um [noise] I'm protecting your assets because someone got sick in a nursing home might be needed it's all these different situations and challenges that we have in life and um you just want to make sure you were when you make that decision that you've done your due diligence\nAnd you're going with the person you feel comfortable with mhm\nSo I did have you know again I'm picking your brain's because people are asking me questions even though they come into the radio station but you know I was I'm emailing back and forth with a colleague\nAnd who was saying I talked to a professional and they were saying something that sounded different than what you that what you and I were talking about when you are you know and the sandwich generation we're all like okay you got the kid and you got the elderly parents and\nThis person was literally getting advice that said oh your your mom should just gift you her real estate if you want to avoid\nYou know um if you want to save the house from her ever having to go into a nursing home and I'm like that does not sound right\nWhat do you mean just just like gifted person yeah directly gift like here here's your house here he's the ... name\nRight so can you explain that and why 'cause from our conversations I was like I really think that that's not the right thing to\nDo well my first piece of advice for these you know seek a qualified all our estate planning attorney but did you say they went to an James and it was led led rising right we're not attorneys here but I mean we've been [noise]\nUm you know dealing with this type says these types of situation with our clients service since we've been in business sign a we've always\nConsulted with attorneys all our estate planning attorneys and you know part of the whole plan I we do for our clients\nIs you know part of the plan is the estate planning they ask for protection planning of somebody becomes ill and we go over all of that how do you avoid probate how do you provide just to be some rules how do you keep assets and the blood line if your children get divorced and all of these other items and that usually incorporates um\nYou know a state planning strategies and legal documents trust and wells and powers of attorney health care proxies and\nGifting strategy you talked about Joni and um again we're not attorney so we discuss all this and recommend um that they seek out an attorney to get these documents done for the uh\nFor the benefits that there are looking for but um that I say is if if our clients do not have an attorney\nThere's attorneys that we've known for many years and all they do is a state planning another large wedding that we refer them to when they can even visit them read it at our office so they kinda get everything done you know under one roof but they have they don't work with us they would just wait for them to them but it's kind of nice to know that um you know it's kind of the professional team\nAnd we also have you know CPAs we can refer them to basically any any area life and the financial world we can you know at least I'm guide them [noise]\nBut anyways with that situation I'm In all my experience is you really I I don't see a good reason to just gift or a change the ... directly to a child because what happens is\nA couple of things that's where we say homespun solution just can you know create bad results when you just gift and asked her to a child like real estate or even stock to things happen is you know you're doing that to protect from your risk like say oh if I go in a nursing home they're going to take a ... gift it\nThen it's not mine well that's true there is what they call a five year period a fabulous back before it's totally protected\nBut you just added all of your child to risk what if your child goes bankrupt goes in business and goes bankrupt what a child gets divorced what is your child gets sued\nYour house is now in your child's name you're you're taking on all his or her rescue could lose out that way [noise] um yeah and it's even it could be worse for the child because when you inherit an asset", "show_name": "Family Financial Focus with Paul Welch & Larry Welch from 93

D. too meant for an eye heart radio station\nThe way we manage our my right that they're in and I think as you know a perplexed um\nSituation for many people because they're unsure which way to go with my ... right and we see people you know every day the ... and we know that that's true it depends what part of their life to Iran that some people like you just mentioned Jody I don't know what their ages are but if you're approaching that age where you want to start saving for a house you must be younger\nRight I mean they just got married they be you know and they're like okay we're gonna yeah now see I didn't do all the next thing that you're supposed to do after you get married is now okay we're thinking about getting a house and so you know the and today we're talking about it's like just an average house ... like just an average house how does a young person\nAfford the mortgage we're not talking a mansion but the prices of housing\nFor the ... the father and their grandmother brands [laughter] so what we want to buy a house you got any money\nOn that yet I come to your aunt\nAt a stage of life while you're young and you're trying to accumulate wealth right for a down payment or purchase of um a property yeah so that allocation would be quite a bit different with just say than an allocation for people who are sixty years old they want to retire when they're sixty three right right totally different and then\nThose same people that you're talking about Joni\nYou know they also have to look at it is a long way away but which will be doing as far as putting away for our own retire time and right and many people find themselves that you know age thirty five forty five and\nThey're looking at that and say maybe I should be putting more away yeah if I'm putting more away how should I allocate the money at age ... which is quite a bit different than someone who's fifty five and looking at retirement you know a decade away ten years\nThey have a different allocation than someone who's forty five when your body five you're looking for wealth you looking to obtain wealth grow your accounts and hopefully achieved that wealth southern Iraq fifty five or sixty you have a nice nesting set aside for retirement\nUm so but when you get to those ages at age fifty five and six day then you're looking at well it's not so much more about gaining that wealth anymore if you've done a pretty good job and have somebody put away and the next day\nIt's more about wish wish I'd be today if I'm gonna retire in five years which I allocate which my investments look quite live up until that time every time and and what should I look like at retirement and the goal is ...\nTo create wealth for retirement the goal is to sustain financial independence now in through our retirement\nMhm well and then the question is and how do you do that when you're younger it's like All right how much can you live on and max out that for a one K. or your for all three baby or ... whatever you can into that ... you know and well and they are a challenge\nWhether it's you know most people that come into the U.S are getting close to retirement so it's more about conserving what they have but also growing it and providing income in the future is so it's all a matter what the objectives are you of your money is for like you know for younger people\nFor retirement money it's the eighth wonder of the world has the power of compounding but that's a long term money um I'll give you an example of that there's the uh one of my clients come in for a review when we were discussing his daughter um but before I get into that if you're saving for a home\nWithin the next year or two it you're not really looking for growth you already need the money so you're looking for access so anything you're going to use within the next year or two Joni it's not how much broke you get it just making sure it's there it's liquid and it said that would be bank savings okay um [noise] but if it's a difference\nBetween banks savings and a money market [noise] nothing [laughter] Hi I'm not\nAn allergy ... somewhat technically it's\nDifferent I don't know what I'm you know most money market accounts that you receive also um you know have protection and some of them half\nMaybe even FDIC or other insurance but a money market is basically a savings account and um and then of course regular banks savings and I you know we usually we open up a brokerage account is money market savings and there's different money market in the broke would you can go into a but based on the it's all just savings which means it's liquid in a safe and of course you know a regular bank savings\nI mean you could buy like a one year CD if you're going to use the money you know a little after a year\nBut you know for for money you need within the next several years the next couple of years it's not really growth you don't want to risk it might not because all I might get eight percent but you might lose eight percent my um but anything over that especially for retirement money then you know you're looking for ultimate growth\nIn the market goes down it's like who cares I don't need it now my man if you're adding every pay period are every month or so you're actually buying more shares so\nAs you young it doesn't really matter heavily and so um the reason I just just brought to mind exist last week or two weeks ago um clients came in for a review when in their daughter\nOr just changed careers and she's only thirty and she did a good job in the previous employer fall McKay she saved forty thousand dollars a laugh and I think it was raw wood yeah right our younger people to do a raw\nSo that means that forty thousand now she won't be adding to that anymore because that's a previous employer form and care costs she\nI'm not if I mean she will I'm sure get a new job and she can start a new employer four one K. but you know we were discussing that and saying well now she can roll that over to our own\nIndividual Roth IRA and you know at age thirty she wants to just keep it all invested in the stock market she doesn't really need any\nBond she said I'm not going to use is she's thirty so maybe she won't use it for thirty five years until she sixty five or ... you know she can't really touched the growth until she's Fifteen and a half without a penalty she can always take out the contributions 'cause it's a rough [noise] but anyways I explain to them the old rule uh Seventy two\nNumber oh I Love this guy had hit me\nSo [laughter] the role of Seventy two it's a pure mathematical rule that does not telling you how to invest your money but\nIf you take Seventy two divided by the growth rate that's how long it takes money to double so you know if you look at a stock market over you know Thirty years probably average like ten percent a year because it's going to be good and bad years\nSo Seventy two divided by ten I mean basically money doubles and every every seven years wow you know if you earn seven percent than Seventy two divided by seven is every ten years six percentage every twelve years\nSo I explained to them that forty thousand dollars with the rule of Seventy two\nHow much do you think that money if she average is ten percent of yeah what do you think that it'll be worth when she's sixty don't make me do math Paul Go ahead you you have a calculator forty thousand dollars average in ten percent per year\nUm it at age sixty five will be one million two hundred and eighty thousand dollars with no contributions\nThat we're not on the back right after that\n[noise] news radio ten thirty and Ninety three financial group a perfect combination for the information you need to make a no obligation

forty thousand to a million to eighty I like I still blown away at the arms to\nUnbelievable but it's just pure mathematics is just math and but then you'll get a comment oh yeah but I'm thirty sixty five a million to eighty won't be worth anything\nI was gonna say yeah there\nBut it is worth more than not having it isn't\nIt is you know what if somebody tells my kids are so you know okay so you're thirty and this is what you're going to do and by the time you're sixty five you're going to have one point two million I think that kid would do that with that thorough with that forty\nGrand or talk to people you know upon I better this career for over twenty five years yeah you know we talked to clients Twenty years ago\nAnd they ever thought that they'd be worth over a million dollars today that was like insane that will never had of it yeah but now they're saying clients come in and the worst one point eight million whenever my age just just real estate alone my right Ryan Lee in any area in in this general Boston\nYou know area the real estate has gone up so much\nWell that's why a lotta times still today you know I'm young kids some of the trends are they don't care about buying a car they're fine without buying a car you know are owning a car but\nEveryone today is still like we know they've seen their parents homes increase in value right there like okay and they wanna a stable home and the staple investment real estate is still a pretty stable investment um especially now because the\nLetter for ... for young people to to get home though with the market\nSo crazy world you know and then it's inflation that you are talking about with that forty thousand grow dollars growing at one point two million and what does one point two million got to be worth ... years from now right it's not going to have the same value as a does today ... short ... you know because of inflation so\nThe reality that is that's the truth right to have the one point two million to not to have it\nTwenty years ago the house that you bought for two hundred grand that you look at it now and you're like wait it's what it's like what my little how you know is over five on your gun I I'm living in a half a million dollar house and you're sitting there going yeah you know thinking\nYeah but not not for people who are first time buyer right they don't realize now I just think that the average price today is five hundred seven hundred thousand dollars\nAnd how can a young couple today have I have enough of a\nDown have you know now they're talking about forty year mortgages are you able to afford the monthly payments and that's why you know it is smart\nAir income is more than the incomes right people ... and I so it's all relative is just on my wedding that inflation is inflation but what I Want to be a that's important for retirees to understand well even inflation\nOr as you know I again if you'd maybe just listening to your left turn on the radio by saying\nJust a pure madam mathematical rule if you take your growth rate divided by Seventy two that's how long it takes you money to double so if you average ten percent a year so you have money invested a hundred percent in stocks I mean that can happen I'm not saying you're going to get right right right but at age thirty if you have forty thousand dollars\nAnd you average temperature than a year and your money doubles every seven years by age sixty five that forty thousand is now a million two weighty seem crazy but you can just\nDo the math right right right um [noise] but then the question is how much would that be worth you know it's not going to be worth anything when I'm sixty five with inflation but it just just I'm just one quick math on my head say inflation is three percent a year\nSo you might knock off one third of that but ... million to waiting might be worth you know ... inflation adjusted maybe I don't know seven hundred stole a lot of money [laughter] so um [noise] anyway so by just before the break you know you ask and you know what what would the average stock market doing a ten year period and you know if you look at any\nIndices over different ten year periods or you know a long term an average it out you know in any ten years you know the ah\nThe market could do seven to ten percent of the ten year period but then you talk to individual investors and they've only average three percent\nAnd there's been studies on this um you know a certain mutual fund might average eight percent per year and then you talk to the shareholders of mutual fund and they only average three percent per year it makes no sense right yeah but the reason is\nIs people get in and out of the market that sticking with it you know instead of sticking with that investment or staying in the market\nOver you know ten or Twenty years or Thirty years like I said life gets in a way although I had this forty thousand but then eight years later I had to withdraw ten or or I got nervous when the market went down and I put it all in the bank and then I put it back in\n... I had to even pay the taxes on the scale of the stocks and ...\nWill get in and out of investments that giving up the overall long term return\nUm even if there's been different studies if you miss just like one or two of the largest um performing days out of the year it can drastically\nUm reduce your overall growth over the years a words there are some the market goes down fast Joni but it goes up fast right and if you miss like a you know one week the market could go up to a three percent in a week\nAnd if you missed that out if you missed out on that because you got out of the market because you were nervous because it went down ... then you you lose out on the upside potential so what we say is don't get all in a rollout stay with your long term objectives in address the market cycles\nRice but one of the other things that you know because I'm thinking that so if you've been in the market for the past forty years a hundred\nPercent you know you would say well I must have four times that but when we see all of a sudden that re correction or the big debt like we saw in two thousand seven two thousand eight if you had\nTwo hundred thousand in the stock market in one disastrous mold without the rebalancing and stuff you just took your two hundred and it dropped down to one sixty or one\nIssue with that is is this is where it gets scary is um whatever you lose you pretty much have to earn double just to get back to where you were so you have two hundred thousand\nAnd you add it all on stocks and like in say two thousand two thousand nine for example the stock market went down to fifty percent right now you're two hundred is one hundred\nSo now you lost half your money you would think oh I have to earn fifty percent to get back up to two hundred no when you lose fifty percent you now have to earn one hundred percent just to get back to where you were so I you know if you have two hundred now which one hundred\nThousand one hundred to get back to two hundred and ... to ... a hundred percent of a hundred thousand is so that's why we feel it is so important\nTo stay with the long term objectives but addressed the market cycles because if you look at it another way\nIf you had a diversified portfolio from like you know safe from any time period Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand eight and you were ... against us a mock it was going up so then when the market did go down you already had some of your profits off the table you didn't lose as much as if you just kept it all on stocks life so I'm well\nAnd that we refer to as Alan ... and that's what we do for our client\nOur opinion it's so important you know to go as you're going forward what your investment says to actively manage\nBut you really want to take care of your\nYourself for your own retirement and of course of a family business you want to help all your family members have their own kind of re timeline I write 'em then a lot of other things come in with family businesses um business continuity of something happens to the owner usually that's the blood of the business yeah do you have a plan if the owner um\nHas a has an accent and becomes disabled are unfortunate death\nUm if there's a partnership if something happens to one of the partners as like by cell agreements or the um\nThe remaining ... the um the other partner so you ... you know the ... to take care of his or her family\nBusiness continuity when you retire do you plan to pass on the business either tier\nYeah maybe a family member or you know to sell it or maybe some of the employees may want to purchase it so these are all things that we discuss and across the state planning and something happens to you do you have the trust work set up in cooperation with the business in real estate and everything else so I kind of the planning\nYou know business owners safe so to\nSpeak like the following [laughter] yeah yeah I Would sell the business 'cause they're at their age where they could retire I Would sell the business\nYou know and just and just you know\nTake the money and live off that money and everything would be fine\nBut I don't want to sell the business because I have my children working here I have my right you know my niece has my nephew is the family business like Paul explain is somewhat supporting\nFinancially other people on his own family right so the seller business right is I I Would but I'm not going to so we need we need to keep building this as I said ... and I need to be you know that the head person in the business and the the the question becomes at some point\nThere has to be a decision made ... and those are difficult decisions for business owners do I sustain this business so I keep going ... who's going to take the business over how's it going to run you know should I is selling the best thing for everybody are is selling the worst thing for everybody so it's not just them personally themselves\nWhat they're thinking about is their own family by you know and and what benefits is this is going to have this family going forward and and you know I'm looking at my own kids to work and they're all working harder obtaining an income at all yes good why would I Want to sell this is a good situation or another\nCommon situation that we run into was a ... you know say it's a family business mom and dad on the business and two of the sons of working in the business with them and their daughter was not so they're going to pass that business onto their two sons\nBut that's not fair to the daughter and the daughters should get some some equal value so there's ways of doing that way you you know if the\nOne or two children are ... are going to receive the business how do you balance that value well with other assets for the um child on the children that are not going to receive the business right so that's all part of you know the family planning the estate planning the business continuity planning\nSo there's a lot that goes into it and deal with all of that not just us we have a whole professional team a network you know attorneys that we can refer people to and all that\nRight well I think people just forget that it really needs to focus on the objective first what is your object in and that there was a plan and a strategy to meet that objective ... and if we can focus on map you know than than yourself that's the that's the plan will be back right after that\nLife is busy and your time is\nValuable ask yourself do you want to spend your free time enjoying your family for worrying about your investment why

invest for every time I'm going to retire in five years ... you're given specific investment advice you need to be careful with them because I mean I don't want it on you but all your money and\nGoogle you know I should work out pretty good maybe the right advice and it might work out fine but it may be the wrong advice lie and it doesn't work out so good but it was on hold Joe who gave the advice why so we all in a certain way need to understand that\nAnd whatever where the challenge it might be whether it's it's as if it's in the financial world is that in my opinion it's so involved today there are so much so to speak that Wall Street is offering and financial companies are are offering and brokerage houses that it is so much it's somewhat overwhelming it's ridiculously overwhelm aid for the person\nWho is not doing this Monday through friday as their ...\nSo in that in my opinion and that sort of challenging in a financial world you should seek out an adviser my someone that you trust someone that you know has has experienced at someone who understands a financial world and putting plans together ... specific plans\nSo um you know that I'm not ... well I guess in a way I'm not a health writer [laughter] I mean obviously we're in business with a lot of people to come in and see us I mean people do but you know whether it's office or anyone else you should see the the guidance\nOf a financial planner investment advisor that you've been proven yourself in interviewing you know a few of them I Do you find that when that you feel comfortable and you feel confident and you know that they have the experience to I'm not only do the analysis but to be you know ... assistant you as time goes on\nI I got an example of that and it's a lot of times when it comes to family\nHum people your turn to which usually a lot of times it's not all how should I invest by money it's a situation like oh my mother's ill and my father's worried about\nUm her enter in a nursing home and how do they protect the eyes and you know my dad was thinking of just transfer in the house to me\nThese types of questions and um that's where a homespun solution can really turned into a disaster oh just transfer the houses are your son's name you're going to leave it to him any ways and you don't understand the risk all of a sudden\nYou you're you put the sun's risk on that property what if he goes bankrupt or miles in business or goes bankrupt or gets divorced all these other things you know your property could be at risk or he takes on your\nCapital gains exposure rather than inheriting I'm just going over some right right right things that can happen\nSo a lot of times those are the types of family questions that come up but again if if you are the person that's receiving that question like Larry said\nHopefully you know enough not to give specific advice but to turn our guide them or refer them to a professional that would really ... you don't know the proper advice and I've example of that I you know I have clients that call me\nI'm for that situation and just last week one of my clients called me and not for himself and he said you know I have a friend that unfortunately\nHis um the friend's wife you know unfortunately is not doing well and they're concerned about what they call after protection if she enters a nursing home and how do they protect the assets and all of that [noise] so he knew a little bit but he knew enough\nNot to give specific advice so when my client called me I basically gave him some\nYou know some guidance while this would be the situation if ... if she enters a nursing home this is what he would want to do generally but it it you know the the real answer was I referred\nMy client to refer him to a elder law attorney and there's been planning attorney that I Know so you know by the friend go into my client on my client going to me and then me go into the attorney right that individual is going to get the proper advice hopefully\nRight right right yeah and and so many times and we're going to talk about this coming up is um what happens when you're in that situation where you are company is offering buyouts you know everyone ends up turning to each other going well what are you doing well what do you deal and did you do the lump sum or did you do the ...\nAnd without really having the proper sounding board a well this is my life this is what's going on in my family these are my objective people end up just doing what the person in the next cubicle as doing\nI mean I don't know what I'm doing you know but someone's yeah what you're talking about\nIs you have an employee that off as an early retirement package mind and that's why we you know we do planning for people's hair I plan on retiring in five years say their age six to I'm going to retire at sixty five but again to life gets underway and all of a sudden at age sixty three you get a notice\nHey we're often you this early retirement package so now it's like oh shit I retired two years earlier I should I take the package and I'll take the package and if you take the retirement package you know how should you take it to a lot of times it could be like a year a severance pay or\nThey add money to your pension plan or so there's all and then if you're under sixty five what about my health insurance into I receive Medicare so there's so much that goes into that but um you know we do all kinds of analysis for people that you know come in with that\nThat situation right and sometimes it's a blessing sometimes I go I wasn't really expecting this I don't know if I should take it or not um but you want to make a wise decision because it's one of the most important decisions you're making your life right so we are those\nAre the things that people give you the cookie cutter solutions\nThey go oh just do that yeah you're like oh I Won the lottery just do\nThat yeah we ... a Bible in my opinion everybody's different and you really want to do the proper analysis because it depends on you know what your budget is you know get married is your spouse still working is all kinds of things that go into it in different ways of\nTaking well a lot of it and you know a lot of people are facing that decision or talking to their coworkers yeah right right and they're asking them what they're doing yeah and their coworkers is not your life your life is your life\nYour coworkers might have a total different you know scenario going on and they're opting are choosing one type of election that are often having a pension plans that could be like a monthly income for the rest of your life\nAnd for you that might not make sense that if you take the lump sum and put it in an IRA but so that\nPeople need to ask what makes sense for me right again have the right feedback loops will be back with more coming up right after this [noise]\nNever know what's going to get with the promise you one thing

Paul and blurry Welsh and here's your host Joni see on it and we're\nBack with family financial focus here on WB the ten thirty am I'm ... and Larry while you're here and uh\nYou know we have so much wonderful information and more than that you're always very focused on having everyone that you talk to become more knowledgeable\nThat's always your your it seems to be the focus is you want people to understand how things work right you know I mean that's been the focus of our shell here because it gets just to complicate\nUnderstand your your um auction to understand your investments know what you own and why are you on it by and you know we're talking before the break about retirement packages and pension packages and it's overwhelming you get a I mean people come in with a stack of papers\nYou think you were I'm learning a new language try and you've got to figure out all these different decisions and again these decisions are usually every book all you can check off a pension option and then six months from now change your mind and you know if you check off a monthly income and you can't six months when I say I want the lump sum you don't have a lump sum you've got a monthly income ...\nRight right and I I think that's one of the things that were really trying to\nEncourage people to take the time when it comes to your money and money decisions\nYou know how we raced through life you know buying something quickly or do it we're so used to doing other things so fast instantly I just want to I'll just I'll just just just just mhm and then we go but when it comes to your money and investing that's not a quick\nProcess you know and that's why you have to you know so many times I sit here and I toss out\nA handful of different topics but you do this all the time you're constantly\n... is sometimes you hear these commercials on these big institutions saying\nYou can roll over your four one K. and Fifteen minutes and you know we have a four one K. specialist I can help you with that but that's just the mechanics that's just the process can design three are you a sign of arm and then they send it to the fall and K. and they're all the money over to the brokerage firm and that but rather overheads mechanic in it but if you look at it another way\nHey I worked at this employer for thirty six years I saved\nEvery pay period through good and bad I sacrifice some benefits that I could have taken more vacations I Hope that my kids more but I knew I had a safer I my retirement I had the sleepless nights when the market was down but I kept saving my so you know thirty forty years of saving and and okay\nYeah the the mechanics might be Fifteen minutes would maybe I should put more than Fifteen minutes on you know where this money is going to going to be rolled over to it how is it going to be allocated how am I going to take out the income I Need how's it going to grow how women are going to take out too much risk\nAnd my having somebody actually helped me with us up a fresh you know if I Am how how is he or she being compensated is it a fee bases commission based what if I'm not happy with the investment so you know maybe put more than Fifteen minutes in the decision before you do that Fifteen minute mechanics of rolling it over\nAnd do the research you know the ... are you talking yeah how are they getting um compensated how are they licensed what is that person's objective right and you know the thing that makes me crazy as if I talk to any of my friends or family members and somebody goes oh they said just do this\nAnd then I'm like well did you ask them how much they were getting ... no no and I'm like\nHow could you not ask all the right that's why I Love the I'm Charles Schwab commercialized that there's a new one where the brokers in front of the\nClass oh hey I've year\nOlds and yeah well how are you getting paid ... ... you know what is your cost and what if I'm not happy\nAnd they are like what are you teaching that but I Wish they were teaching kids at this age growing now I Know that empowered\nThe idea is that you should have a plan right right because the investment world has become so involved in it so much on the market place today offered through insurance companies and brokerage houses and Wall Street and it's just it's it's like we said before it's almost overwhelming like\nI I don't know where a best buy money right but before I started invested in my money we need to have a plan right you know again if you whatever age or out of your age sixty as an example of retirement is five or six years away you need a plan for your time it right you know you don't want to wait six months before you retire [laughter] you know but some people do they wait six months before he retired but\nIt is good to take some time\nAnd you have time you got you know five or six years do you take some time find a good adviser\nIt wherever that might be in it and then make sure that you have done they've done you're done with them a good analysis on what your knees are going to be as much as possible six years from now when you retire\nAnd then what are you going to need to do between now until that six year how's your money expected to grow up until that time how much money are you expected to contribute to your four one K. what's it going to look like five or six years from now are you going to have enough money\nTo sustain financial independence for the rest of your life or what are you going to have for income I'm going to have Social Security mhm that's it right right right I'm going to have Social Security and a pension\nOr going to have my Social Security myself as Social Security every one is in a different situation but without all that so to speak knowledge and information it would be hard to put together\nAn allocation of investments now not understanding what the goal is right at cheers from now right and I think so many of us are so quick like you said donate to make decisions without really doing\nThese things are funny to now says I just wanted I wanted off my to do list as you say all the time right so that would be good if you're buying a car or whatever I got the cars out there to drive but it's great I Love the color [laughter] when it comes to investments we can't think like that now I Know it's just not a color\nIt's important right you know your ability to be able to ... again ... financial independence for the rest of your life you need a plan\nAnd we talking about you know one of the things that I'm that I've learned from just hanging out with you is the importance of having that the proper sounding board the educated um feedback that you need I came in um\nYou know earlier this week and thinking about like well I I'm I'm watching the news earlier the week and they kept telling him out interest rates interest rates going up and I'm like\nOkay I don't know what that means does this mean I'm Out of luck if I'm going to try to buy a house right now does this mean that something's going to happen to my investments or what does that mean so for everybody who was wondering this week when you were watching the news\nGoing interest rates are going up and you sit there and go okay I have no idea how that's going to affect me how does that new wells that\nAnd that that's where you're really have to understand your investments and your allocation and your long term objectives and understand the different position to have in your portfolio and how they perform and what the daily values are and understand why you on certain positions and\nYou know we talk about this all the time and uh you know that as an average portfolio you'll have some stock fund that's on bond funds you know stocks your own you know basically shares of the corporation you profit them in the company does well with evidence and the share price going up bonds you're actually\nWhat a bond is or a bond mutual fund a mixture of bonds as you're actually loaning money to an institution whether it's a corporation or the government like the ten year treasury and what happens with Barnes is if new interest rates are going up and your own owning you own bonds that will purchase previously\nUm you can see a bond market share price go down so you know with the fed the ten year treasury one over three percent recently so what happens if you have individual bonds are bond mutual funds are bondi to yes those are all bonds that were purchased previously", "show_name": "Family Financial Focus with Paul Welch & Larry Welch from 93
