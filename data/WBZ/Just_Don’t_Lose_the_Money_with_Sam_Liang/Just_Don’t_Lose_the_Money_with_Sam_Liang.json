Mike as you said earlier you know you thought you had a plan on all four oh one K. your current four one K.\nDoesn't add up to a plan and that's where we I think where the differences learning more about a three sixty five retirement plan we said three sixty five because you know retirement and it takes a day off since there's three hundred and sixty five year\nSo we named the trademark three sixty five plan and it really works because not only does it sort of take a step back the first step was we talked about earlier drop the show is to discover what somebody's goals are you know my worries are different than your average do I want to travel a whole lot\nOr maybe it's just about leaving a lot of money to your family maybe it's about not even about money maybe it's about lifestyle and taking care of the grandchildren from that point on John you do a great job with the analysis stage where you really just shine a spotlight on what they're doing\nDuring these on certain Financial Times we want to help people navigate through this time and by having a sound investment process in a plan it doesn't take all the ... but it makes people understand that I have an understanding\nOf what I have how it works and how I'm going to get from point a to point B ...\nAnd we also communicate with the clients have listen to the markets acting very volatile right now we explain to them we give them calls we email and then we explain to them what is happening what's causing it oftentimes people don't know\nWhy they're accounts drop and they do to the news on TV and that makes them uncertain by having that sound investment process and having a plan\nIt should be able to weather all aspects of the market\nAnd I think one of the big difference between what a lot of people do and what happens when they get our three sixty five retirement plan is because after\nThe third step which is recommendations often we say to them hey look you know you've been to an okay job growing the money but you can't just rely on the money continues to grow and earn more and more data distribution plant them and then complain\nBecause you know back in the day you don't have to worry about their pension you need a five thousand dollars a month in between Social Security and your pension it's forty five hundred dollars a month so you didn't have a big difference to make up today it's obviously very different right so\nBy having a solid not only accumulation playing John which is what you can ride to a great job that you also need to have an income distribution plant an exit strategy to make sure that you have reliable income each and every month to pay the bills\nAnd when we do have days like we had a few weeks back the reason why the phone's been ringing the reason why when you have a conversation with a client is hey look you know this is why the market went down but it's okay 'cause we're not relying on the part that is going up and down and put food on the\nTape you know we're not using a growth component for income so we we use income components to generate a stream of income that the individual needs um I think the income component is often the most overlooked component any financial planning without um they don't take into consideration the taxation inflation\nThey just have a pile of money and they just don't understand how the and extract money from this and extraction paying the these these individuals they're trying to extract money from\nA plan with the markets dropping so that's when you can now now it's compound the problem for poor individual who doesn't really have a plan he's making withdrawals as the markets decline in front of a declining\nAsset and might you know what we often see is that a lot of times people at this stage their lives\nEspecially when they're very near retirement when we retire they're making a lot of decisions good or bad based on emotions yeah killer as you say hello to kill her you know emotions oh my goodness I got to get the heck out because I'm going to lose everything tomorrow or I'm I'm gonna hang in there will be fine comeback\nBut that's why diversified true diversification and retirement is important having money that's set aside to grow having money that's set aside to give you that income stream and you know you you really need both\nWe use smart portfolios and smartphone those to help us automate those good decisions and also to help us prevent making those emotional decisions in those tough markets\nIt's just don't lose the money radio and just don't lose the money dot com sand and John I'm so glad that you guys are talking about this emotion and how it can basically paralyze us from making good decisions you know we see the market climbing and climbing and climbing as it has been\nA but we tend to forget what happened just a short ten years ago as Suzie Orman puts it you know if we try to do the right thing and take a motion out of things were going to be okay\nI

C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never a [noise]\nHow to set it up so people can understand in part of what we do here on Sunday is not only over here to have some fun\nBut we're here to help people you know we had to educate people on\nThe things that need they need to be aware of as they get close to retirement things are available in the market that they're not actually investments and all of those things in a Stanford University study talked about retirement income generator is what we call in the industry ... and if you\nHaven't heard about that stay tuned we'll talk certainly much more about regs\nBut essentially if you think about Iran you help a lot of people a lot of our clients\nDiversify um\nHave an asset allocation as they accumulate money as they as they grow money and you're you're educating them on why they should have money inequities why they should have money and maybe some safe for things\nBut really diversification yeah in same on top of that you need diversification within your retirement income portfolio is that's exactly what race are you know raises an opportunity for people to understand that not only do you have options as the money's going up\nBut as the money that you're taking out you have to have a diversified income sauce so what do we mean by that most people understand Social Security we have it you retire and let's say you have your your essential expenses you housing do you know your real estate taxes maybe your car payment let's say five thousand dollars a month\nAnd your Social Security is four thousand dollars a month between you and your spouse well that will go a long way and you you can count on that you know no matter what you know no matter what happens to the economy that four thousand dollars a month is going to come in where are you going to get the difference where are you going to make up the what we called the income gap\nAnd that's where rabies really come in and it shows you different income sources and that's part of what we try to\nHelp people and educate people with how to diversify their income\nYeah you don't want to have to pull from your portfolio in a day it's down eight hundred points right so you want something that is reliable you don't have to worry about you can sleep at night at the end of the\nDay is really what it comes down to you know the sleep factor having added confidence knowing that you can enjoy retirement without sort of like looking over your shoulder every month where's my money going to come from\nYou know and that's going to be a tough situation you see folks that are in the way you pointed the south's same whether you are just retired or you are in those critical five years out from retirement I mean you see a week\nLike we had where the Dow dropped eight hundred points and you may think okay you know I can maybe you know do okay with that but uh guys I'm thinking if you start to string a couple of those weeks together that's where you really start to get in trouble but you guys have already factor that in with a three sixty five retirement plan\nExactly Mike in in those days are going to happen those or you can't avoid those right you just don't want to be in a position where you really have to worry about it so you have to know what you have you have to be able to have confidence that you can still pull money even on the days you're going to lose ... was going to go dropping what Ryan White\nBut it's not there's nothing you can do about what might or might not have short we can't control you know the economy the markets\nBut you can certainly control what you have and be prepared and you know we have this tried and true saying of our two rules were number one just don't lose the money and rule number two don't forget rule number one and it sounds corny but if if you think about that and you follow those two rules as you\nAre in retirement\nMan that would be a lot easier to sort of whether those bad times\nYeah hey listen in may sound corny Sam and I don't believe that it does but if you go back last week and the Dow drops eight hundred points suddenly\nThose two rules are sounded pretty good at and and that's really what the three sixty five retirement plan is designed to do and that's how you guys are helping and not only your clients but folks that are coming to see you for the first time whether it'd be from the radio show here from your website or from the workshops that you guys are having\nThat is how we help people without tried and true\nProven it works it's a process called the three sixty five retirement plan and it's not one of those you know I think sometimes we meet people and they have this notion that they can come in and we're going to talk about high level stuff a lot of numbers are going to tell me exactly what to do\nI got to tell you the first meeting is really us listening I was listening to what somebody is you know worried about what somebody's goals are harming to they want to travel a lot to do they want to just you know and I'll hang out and play with the grandchildren\nDo you think people are a little taken aback by that that that they're expecting that high level conversation when you guys are just asking them questions and really getting to know them I mean that's got to be a little bit of what they didn't expect\nIt very well might be might but it's ... it's necessary for us to put together a tailor customize three sixty five retirement plan that will allow our clients to sleep at night in a day that's all the\nMen right I think a lot of people are surprised because when sometimes you asked people and the first few minutes hey so nice to meet your wife here\nWhat are they always say to us you know my guy or my girl and they don't listen to me I told them I wanted to slow down and not take as much risk in last week I lost five percent they don't listen to me so part of what we do and the very first stage not first process of that three sixty five retirement plan\nIs to listen to somebody's goals wants needs and concerns and then we come back with what Ryan said earlier\nI'm we take all the information and of course we have some some recommendations sort of what we think they can do differently and that's where that customize very personable three sixty five retirement plan comes into play\nIn part of that plan we let you know exactly what you ask you if you got home that day the Dow dropped in her points and you don't know exactly know how that was going to affect your portfolio come in the U.S will sit down

there any contrast share any similarities and and what are you guys are saying that your clients about these drops in the market\nWill it's been a really volatile time Mike I'm I think a lot of people are nervous or unsettled that especially the ones that don't have a plant and they don't really know what they have and it's causing I'm concerned when they see these drops of eight hundred points to a significant amount over two percent to their entire time you know ... you know that sort of you people\nCan picture a ride you're driving down the road and it's pitch black and the lights shining on the deer and what they do they do nothing they stand than they do nothing and that sort of cars precaution\nYeah part of it they don't know what to do exactly they don't have someone reaching out to them and say hey we're still on track we're not on track we need to make some tweaks right so they are Darren headlights and more importantly\nYou know if you are Thirty years old you might have the time to ride it out Ryan yup but you know we deal with a lot of folks that I knew and retirement and in fact the other day\nWe had a phone call with somebody I came to see us and they said you know it's critical that I don't lose any money because I'm gonna retire in about a month you know so now we have a conversation with him we're going to see them for a meeting\nBut imagine for a second if you or that person I retired two months ago and you're saying you know I just need to take five thousand dollars a month out every month because that's what I Need to pay my bills my housing goes my cell phone my gas bill\nAnd everything's going fine and then all of a sudden blame last week you'd be a little worried about taking more money on cars down right\nYeah yeah ... marketing amnesia they forgot what happened in two thousand eight and they didn't plan accordingly to prevent another two\nThousand and they actually you know Mike we came across this really good study by Stanford University their retirement study and they came across really what really intrigued me as how\nTo set it up so people can understand in part of what we do here on Sunday is not only are we here to have some fun\nBut we're here to help people you know we had to educate people on the things that need they need to be aware of as they get close to retirement things are available in the market that they're not actually investments and all of those things in Sanford university study talked about retirement income generator is what we call in the industry ... and if you\nHaven't heard about that stay tuned we'll talk certainly much more about rage\nBut essentially be think about Iran you help a lot of people a lot of our clients\nDiversify um\nHave an asset allocation as they accumulate money as they as they grow money and you're you're educating them on why they should have money inequities why they should have money and maybe some safe for things\nBut really diversification yeah in same on top of that you need diversification within your retirement income portfolios that's exactly what rigs are young Riggs is an opportunity for people to understand that not only do you have options as the money's going up\nBut as the money that you take now you have to have a diversified income source so what do we mean by that most people understand Social Security we habit to retire and let's say you got your\nYour essential expenses you housing bill you know your real estate taxes maybe a car payment let's say five thousand dollars a month and your Social Security is four thousand dollars a month between you and your spouse well that will go a long way you you can count on that you know no matter what\nYou know no matter what happens the economy not four thousand dollars a month is going to come in where are you going to get the difference where are you going to make up the what we called the income gap\nAnd that's where rags really come in and it shows you different income sources and that's part of what we try to help people and educate people with how to diversify their income\nYeah you don't want to have to pull from your portfolio on a day it's down eight hundred points right so you want something that's reliable you don't have to worry about you can sleep at night at ... at the end of the\nDay is really what it comes down to is you know the sleep factor having out of confidence knowing that you can enjoy retirement without sort of like looking over your shoulder every month where's my money going to come from\nAnd that's really what the three sixty five retirement plan is designed to do and that's how you guys are helping and not only your clients but folks that are coming to see you for the first time whether it'd be from the radio\nShow here from your website or from the workshops that you guys are having\nThat is how we help people without tried and true\nProven it works it's a process called the three sixty five retirement plan and it's not one of those you know I think sometimes we meet people and they have this notion that they're going to come in and we're going to talk about high level stuff a lot of numbers want to tell me exactly what to do\nI got to tell you the first meeting is really us listening I was listening to what somebody is you know worried about what somebody's goals are harming do they want to travel a lot of do they want to just you know a hang out and play with the grandchildren\nDo you think people are a little taken aback by that that that they're expecting that high level of conversation when you guys are just asking them questions and really getting to know them I mean that's got to be a little bit of what they didn't expect\nIt very well might be might but it's ... it's necessary for us to put together a tailor customize three sixty five retirement plan that will allow our clients to sleep at night in a day that's all the men\nRight I think a lot of people are surprised because when sometimes you ask people and the first few minutes hey so nice to meet your why here\nWhat do they always say to us you know my guy or my girl and they don't listen to me I told him I wanted to slow down and not take as much risk in last week I lost five percent they don't listen to me so part of what we do and the very first stage and not first process of that three sixty five retirement plan\nIs to listen to somebody's goals wants needs and concerns and then we come back with what Ryan said earlier\nI'm we take all the information and of course we have some some recommendations sort of what we think they can do differently and that's where that customize very personable three sixty five retirement plan comes into\nPlay in part of that plan we let you know exactly what you ask what you got home that day the Dow dropped in her points and you don't know exactly know how that was going to affect your portfolio come in the U.S will sit down will unveil what you have and go through what you have and if it suitable for what you're trying to do help so people Mike what would you say\nI I Would love to do that I was actually going to bring that up because it really is all about helping you in retirement and these things are so complicated and who has time to really stay up to date with all of this stuff so that's why I say I am", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Just

second half of the show but it's\nEven better to be with Susan warning because she is going to be joining us\nNow for the second half of the show how are you were doing great and Susan's a studio but might you said even better to see Susan I makes me feel bad about myself well or logging on it earlier [laughter]\nEverybody loves Susan Susan how are you in the real this is so exciting for me to make thank you for having me on a great role from time to time we get lucky my only at ... absolutely Susan actually flew\nIn just for this this recording and I'm joking here all the time she was here more and more and it's wonderful to see you\nYank you it's great to be here\nIt's it's such a pleasure ah because we hear the two of you so much I really like this because they were going to be able to get an inside look at Susan your and Sam's relationship because it really is one that goes a long way back and has a lot of history together\nFor sure you know like Susan you and I've known each other for quite some time and after a retired and we started having some fun do some things professionally and and your and my clients and we're having we're having a lot of fun helping people educate people on how to sort of do the right thing as they approach retirement\nShe I was really lucky ... would you do know is that um I grew up in this area and then ... area and hadn't had my career\nYou know my my TV Clear Channel five Boston for like almost thirty six years so even before I knew Sam personally I knew of being in laying and as a consumer reporter I knew a Sam laying in his reputation\nSo I had a very unique opportunity to get to know this guy before I ever knew him personally while so then when I get to me\nHe'll reruns rightly\nOr not to mention his wife and family I mean so this has been a great opportunity for me also because Sam and you know I tell you this all the time and I take you publicly and this is a great opportunity to embarrassment really you know I'm not but it gives me an opportunity to continue doing what I always wanted it always wanted to do make we just help consumers\nAnd now I just have a different platform to do that during the ... ... exactly people\nHelping people Mike as we do every Sunday to into retirement and helping people follow those tools were number one just don't lose the money\nAnd rule number two don't forget role number one that's\nIt that's it so we're going to have some fun today we're going to talk to people a little bit about smart retirement strategies and there's been so many studies out there as you and I both know that\nYou know retirement is harder and harder the others but disappearing of traditional pensions many people I see are concerned about the ability for Social Security to be there to sort of keep the promises to wash\nAnd really when it comes down to a lot of the burden has been now put on the consumer and so you know and and I say this over and over again but it'd be nearing retirement and you know if you're five years away maybe even ten years away\nYour your vision and what you need to do day to day has changed a little bit right 'cause when you're thirty when you're
