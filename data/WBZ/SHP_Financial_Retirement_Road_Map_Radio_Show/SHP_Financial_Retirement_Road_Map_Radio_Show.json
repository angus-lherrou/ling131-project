Hi [laughter] this is Rick\nNo get outraged really know that it makes you what I hear what is your claim on the\nLine so Cindy I follow you on social media lot and I notice there's a lot of changes going on with your style and design I was wondering how you keep up with all the trends that are going on\nYou know I could tell you something I'm going to go [laughter]\nAnd we take history him off

C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never so\nAnd it's like um you don't want to be rude but that's that is not someone that would be a good fit for us right Keith in terms of what what our goals are because we're not trying to double someone's money in three to five years you know we do\nThis right and not only that you talk to them and say you know why do you want to do that and I and that's what they [noise] in you know in their minds that's what they think they need to be able to retire successfully but then when you kind of pull back and start to ask them questions around their situation\nYou could say hey look you know you don't need two million dollars to retire it based upon\nYou know what it is that you need on a day to day month to month basis so they're really focusing on the wrong number one of the things I think that we do well is dive in and build and what's called a bowl based plan every family is different every one situation is different everyone's goals are different\nSo it's up to us as independent financial planners to be able to work with each family to discover their goals what it is they want to do and help them achieve I'm ... I'm Sorry to interrupt but but it is also just going to pick up on what keeps saying about the gold based plan I mean\nYou know just to combine that with the idea of diversification is that everything should be diversified you know you should have an income plan you know a legacy plan a health care plan and you should have a diverse in you know diversity within your planning\nBut also specifically just because of putting I mind is the tax planning you should have diversification within ... in your tax absolute you know do you have a higher rate money ... money and after tax money you know ... you know do you have different areas because we love that so\nSo the whole idea of diversification and applies to planning to making sure you have all five areas it applies to investments and apply it applies it specifically within your taxes themselves\nI mean these are just all areas that you need to be focusing on for a true comprehensive plan\nAnd most people that I say I'm going to continue to say this until everyone fiesta planted they deserve but a lot of people come in and they have\nA bunch of investments and or like you said maybe they have like a million to in IRAs and like thirty thousand and raw and ... and checking and savings and there's there's not really a lot of balance there from attack standpoint so we try to create tax diversification we try to ... acid diversification\nAnd we try to create planning diversification meaning everyone if you're thinking\nAbout retirement when you're younger and you're working you're just putting money away you don't really in in essence obviously I think everyone should have some sort of an escape plan but what you're doing is ... is just investment planning [noise]\nYou're not worried about income because you have an income from your job you're not really too worried as you know healthcare situations could come up but most likely as you're older you're not really worried a ton about that\nWhen you're getting close to retire if you if all you have is investments thinking about what your plan is right now you just have a bunch of investments\nOr did you have a fully written plan that looks at income meaning where is your income going to come from when you retire not just from one portfolio but how is it going to come out\nAnd they'd be going to be all pre taxes are going to be tax free what's a combination do you know how to plan your income so last as long as you do and make sure your accounts are set up properly to give you the incoming needed retirement and then we look at investments that is what as you get close to retirement\nWe'll talk about this later in the show but I think you need to look at investments maybe giving some up off the upside it's okay if you don't hit thirty percent in a good year maybe you only get twenty two\nBut that's okay because you're not maybe if you get twenty two when it's a thirty maybe you'll only lose Fifteen when it's down thirty if that makes sense so really you want to have some balance from an investment standpoint in diversification then we talked about taxes\nHow do you create tax efficient plan as you get close to retirement in ... in retirement as well as leaving money to the next generation we talk about health care and we talk about state planning in legacy planning leaving assets to those who you care most about\nAnd so that's what it all comes down to is having a plan that covers each and every area not just a pile of investments and so we think think about in your lifetime what you've done to get to where you are now\nAnd what does that mean to you and do you think you just want to have a bunch of investments and hope it goes right or did you want to have a plan that make you know looks at every single area to make sure it's uncovered\nSo you can retire with a little bit more confidence\nYou know going into your these years can be twenty Thirty years of retirement\nThat sort of thing and so that's an order short on time but like\nThe idea of making sure that people are aware of how much work this is ... there's so much to it and so I that's why I just want to really emphasize cut you off that that that's the whole you know that's why you know 'cause I appreciate when people are like oh you know what to do it myself it's like a pre shit that 'cause I Love doing this too\nBut it's a full time job yeah so do you really want to do that and\nYour retirement yeah I mean if you and some people do if you don't want if you don't want to travel as much and do as much and and be able to run everything that fine we completely respect that\nBut if you're not sure or maybe you say hey maybe I just want to get a second opinion maybe you're someone who does nothing and doesn't want to do some retirement and wants to rely on a professional you want to come and obviously and sit down or maybe you're someone who's not sure and say maybe I Want to run some of this myself maybe I Need a second set of

I still come into that we do encounter people that are that close to retirement and still don't have something written exactly what they're taking money from\nMentioned the patriots show up to a Super Bowl and like Braves about take the field okay what's the game plans like what are you talking about we don't have a game plan will match that see that's a football game this is your whole life is is retirement\nAnd so he's and he also said you know not only do we don't have a plan but we also haven't talked about taxes inflation\nHealth care all that stuff is well I said All right and I said what are your main concerns what do you have and they were lucky enough they worked hard and they saved up a little over one point five million dollars between IRAs a little bit in raw in some some after tax accounts\nAnd I said what are your main concerns he goes well two things I Need sixty thousand dollars per year\nOff my portfolio and I said why or why why didn't you that you think will that be between that sixty thousand my Social Security in a small pension all of a good chunk of income coming in every year and I said well why do you want that income\nIs equal number wants to pay the bills number two I Want to buy a motor home and travel the country for a few years and number three I Want to take a big trip every year with my family and so now we're getting to the heart of really wire here\nAnd I said what else are you concerned about he's like I'm really concerned about leading money behind to list or making sure she's taking care of if something happens to me\nThat's that's on honorable and and I said you know the reason I Know he really meant that is because if someone said that once I write it down if someone says it twice I handle on it and if someone says it three times I circled it and I was that that paper was circled on the line and everything was dies yeah everything on it was a lot of damage to that part of the paper\nAnd so I said since you're retiring in in four weeks I'm assuming you advise is already set yourself up for this and he goes yeah I'm sure you already did and I said well you are you sure you're here for a second opinion you you really open to a second opinion because it's so we're going to really dig deep into your situation I said number one do you mind if you ask how much you're paying and sees\nHe's he takes care of me you know because we were good friends she only charges me point eight five percent per year he's like I Know most people are one one and a half\nI'm only paying point eight five Mike that's not bad\nI'm like the Hubble these mutual funds and other things you own he said well no there's no fee and that image pinpointing five I said All right do you mind I Know you're paying twenty five but you mind if I just run the analysis for you and just see what you're paying and total he said I Know it's gonna be twenty five but go ahead sorry I'm going to do that because if you're open to if you really open to it I'm going to run the real Nelson\nSecondly I said how much risk in your portfolio do you have in my question was one point five million what's the most and this is something if you're if you're if you've nodded off during my initials talk you hear\nThis is one thing you want to remember because I asked him what's the most you'd be willing to lose in a given\nThere without totally losing air being super nervous he saw that one was anything I said Steve come on you got to pay to play this is the market here you have all your money in the market he's a find ten percent\nIt and just as there that's a great question for all of our listeners should ask themselves how much at this stage in your life how much are you willing to lose before you start hitting the panic button and just taken time and just ask yourself that question how much willing to lose at this point in my life and then do you know the answer\nWell he said ten percent found the ... which is a hundred fifty thousand dollars he goes I get nervous when are you saying that but I guess I Am at one point five million if I lost a hundred and fifty I'd be okay I said All right well let's we're going to run your portfolio from arrest standpoint from a fee standpoint\nWe're going to run an income analysis to see if you have enough income in cash flow coming in to cover your needs and achieve their goals and finally a roadmap which outlines of five areas of of our planning process income investments taxes health care and like I said\nHe's ... he's leaving we set schedule the second meeting and that's why I said you might have\nNext meeting you bring your wife back you mind if you bring Liz back he's got she's not going to want to calm she doesn't she thinks he's meetings a super boring I kind of got a chuckle out of that\nAnd I said well just do a favor tell her Derek said it I think it's important for her to come back and be involved in this process and he said fine that's what we'll see I'll do it I can see what I can do fast forward I'm not going to I I don't want to make a story longer than it has to be but when they came back in\n... in between the meetings actually we were running the analysis and it's like it was a different person he said he didn't want to lose a certain amount of money he said he had he was only paying a certain amount of fees and I was looking at the analysis

P. financial we build our clients\nAn investment plan that managed in the market according to their risk tolerance which is a big that's what everyone does in our in our industry but then we also take it one step further as part of our retirement road map planning a trademarked plan that we do for our clients\nAfter we build the investment plan we build I'm also an income plans clients have an income plan\nThey know where their money's coming from in retirement soon have to worry about it whereas my paycheck going to come from when I retire because retirement could be Thirty years of unemployment so you have an income plan that lasts as long as you do with inflation you have an investment plan next step you look at his taxes\nHere in in Europe are there ways we can save on taxes for you and the next generation maybe we can save you ten twenty thousand this year maybe nothing next year maybe more afterwards but each year you have to make sure that someone's taking a look at taxing goes in your portfolio ongoing\nNext to this health care I mean the study of cost of health care goes up and up and up and so if we neglect that if we don't look at health care as a retirement expense again we're missing the boat\nFinal piece state planning and legacy how do you take all the assets that you've worked so hard to save up and pass them to the next generation so\nAgain that's when I asked when I'm going back to the question how we grown so much over the last ten Fifteen Years since we started in two thousand three is taking care of my clients putting them ahead of ourselves obviously which is anyone can say it sounds like you know normal\n[laughter] you know talk that ... million you will but it's true and the second thing is obviously having a plan our clients have a full retirement road map\nTo get through and through retirement it's not just hey here's a bunch of money invested for me and tell me if I made money or lost money it's a plant it's a road map and that's and it looks at income investments taxes health care and legacy not only in the beginning but ongoing it's not et cetera and forget it so if you're listening [noise]\nIf you're not sure maybe you think you have a plan but maybe you just have a bunch of statements\nMaybe you have an advisor and you're not sure if they're doing all these things for you or maybe you've been like not talked about so busy working so busy with family and lifestyle and just you haven't had time like many people that are coming to see us like you know I've been wanting to do this for years\nBut don't let that don't want these years go by where you procrastinate and then not having a plan comes back to bite you and so if you want to take advantage of a no obligation review we would love to sit down with you we have offices in Plymouth\nWill burn Hyannis Westboro in brain tree type to do is pick up the phone just let us know that you want to know obligation retirement roadmap review at one of our offices and you can call right now the number to do so is eight hundred\nTo two seven Seventy seven Seventy seven I get one more time that's eight hundred to two seven seven seven seven seven and you can also go to our website and register for a meeting there at S.

H. P. story segment right now and I think it's important because a lot of you can relate to some clients that we've taken on last few years and clients maybe uh been with us for Fifteen Years obviously every story is different and not everyone situation is the same\nBut I figured you could relate to the story because we ended last segment\nTalking about the major the major goals and rules of retirement planning in the final rule that we gave which was real number five was to make sure you have a plan in place before retiring and don't don't just be reactive and then retire and say oh wait I Need a plan\nBecause everyone knows it's a lot better to have a plan in place\nBefore you retire than waiting to retire and then trying to scramble at the last minute so mark and Karen head hurt our radio show for about four or five years say we've been on we've been on the station to think about ... close to ten years on the radio and they had heard us for the last four or five years and they were in their fifties when they started listening to us\nAnd after a while they they they said they wanted to come in three or four years ago but like a lot of other folks have been procrastinating\nSo actually go through the story I Want you to think about whether or not it makes sense to come in for a review sea of some of these areas that we're talking about makes sense to you as they did to mark and Karen\nSome arc and Karen really they had a few concerns that came in from the radio show and when they first met I could tell they were a little apprehensive you know the it's not something you do every day to go through\nYou know open up your finances and share your life story and what your goals are in family goals and you know income goals and just a it's a big deal and they so they were a little apprehensive just nervous just warming up a little bit at once but once we\nGot to know each other and got to know their situation\nIt became apparent we were going to be able to help them out quite a bit and so I was talking to mark and Karen in that first meeting and they had really a few major goals\nNumber one I remember there sixty years old and they came in a few months ago so this isn't an old case they really want to make sure they retire between age sixty five in sixty six they've saved up bought a million thirty thousand dollars so they had about nine hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in the market\nIn about fifty to sixty thousand dollars in bank account so little over a million dollars major things they were concerned about is when I retire\nWhereas my income going to come from how am I going to have the income I Need to cover all my bills and not worry about running out of money because they were only going to have Social Security there was no pension there was no rental income there were only going to have Social Security income\nSecondly they were concerned about volatility\nThey said you know what dark I've heard your show I Know the market's been up for ten years in a row do what you know I'm concerned that if the bottom job so how is that gonna affect our retirement and I remember Karen saying like you know Mark's worked really hard and and and I've worked really hard and we want to retire in the last thing we want to do\nIs not to plan properly and have to go back to work [noise]\nThe other thing they were concerned about is a state planning they were concerned about just having a solid state planned for their like a trust will that it that they had never set up for their children\nAnd then finally they were concerned about fees they had an advisor they had they had worked with for many many years and they didn't really know the total fee they were paying they knew there are paying a management fee of around one point two five percent\nBut they didn't know how much the underlying assets cost him on top of that like the mutual fund cos so again major concerns were how much they're paying fees state planning how much risk or volatility was in their portfolio and how much income they can draw from when they retired or do they have enough for you about eighty thousand dollars per year\nBut that was after taxes keep they needed really over a hundred thousand dollars close to run around a hundred thousand dollars gross so after taxes they could have eighty thousand dollars now than it needs to go up every year great point and that has to go for inflation\nSo the first thing easy solution based on their situation they were able to use the file and suspend technique with Social Security which some people can't use but basically when mark triggers his Social Security uh sixty six\nThen at that point Karen can take half of his and delay hers even longer set by the time she's Seventy she can now get hers and it goes up so that was a quick strategy that made him a good chunk of money very quickly secondly we looked at from an income scenario and an investment scenario\nThey had we we looked at their uh their portfolio to see how much risk they were taken and so this is if you forget everything else about the show to me having volatility control\nIn your plan when you're close to\nOr in retirement might be the most important thing you do for your retirement plan because too much volatility early on in their retirement can literally wipe out a retirement and we've seen numerous examples\nUnfortunately of of people that have come to us in ... or a potential clients that have come to us too late where it was too late to do anything\nFortunately marketing Karen had said that this money and but when I ran an analysis think of like\nAs a a risk score zero to a hundred so if all your money is under your mattress well I guess that's all your money is in a fireproof safe in a place that no one can touch it that would be\nScores like a zero and if all your money is an Enron stock that would be like a hundred and Ninety nine and so they came in and they had a risk score of uh Seventy so you're probably wondering what does that mean to them what to Seventy\nSo when I ran the analysis on their current portfolio they told me dark where we're concerned are advisor we've told him we want to take on less risk as we get older we're concerned that this is not being done\nWhen I looked at their portfolio and they came in for the second meeting I said hey mark herring you're you're absolutely right you know if\nThe way it stands out of Seventy if the market where to go up if we had like a two thousand Thirteen tight market where we consider that a bull market like a really good strong upward market you'd ... you'd probably earn about thirty percent at your current risk or which is what should a quaint two uh two hundred and Ninety thousand dollar game\nHowever if we had a a really bad year like two thousand eight\nAt your current risk level that would be a loss of three hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars and I remember in and at that point yeah member mark looking at care and he's like that's like that's the thing about that the most that's over a third\nOf our entire life savings and they looked like we can't afford to take this risk and I was like what you know why do you think that your advisor did not do this is it you know why did how come that you know they just they are going to do the ... where you're telling people you're telling me must be telling you advisor that you want to reduce your volatility\nAnd so [noise] so think about it at risk or of a Seventy you could make thirty percent and loose thirty five percent basically in a good down here for them they could make two hundred Ninety thousand in a good year\nBut they lose three hundred thirty seven thousand in a bad year I said why don't we change what if we bring you to a thirty four on the wrist scale so getting scaled zero to a hundred and thirty four you can make ... you know fourteen percent in really good year which isn't as good as thirty percent\nButton and it really down your like two thousand eight\nYou'd probably lose about Thirteen percent which is a lot better than losing thirty five percent ... so if we had a ... is the way we set them up at the end of two thousand eight type scenario in this general terms but if if they lost a hundred and thirty thousand dollars on a million they're not going to be high fiving me but if they can deal with it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "SHP Financial Retirement Road Map Radio Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "28", "locations": [["Los Angeles", 34.05223, -118.24368], ["U.S",

H. P. workshops dot com again that's S. H. P. workshops dot com\nAll right we know Keith everyone stories different everyone's situation is different\nBut given the recent market volatility I thought it was important we were talking off line about you know a situation that not only stories work out with happy endings unfortunately and this one we did the best it ended up being happy but it was a little bit of time to get there yeah so if you want to bring everyone back to two thousand eight I think it was a summer of\nTwo thousand two thousand and they you know a couple that I started to have conversations with about working together marking Gina come into the office they come to\nWorship exactly what we were talking you know you were just talking about and they came in to visit with us after that workshop every member mark you know he came in you know and his work clothes you know you just finished up work to kind of dirty because he's a he's a contract he's out there moving things building things and doing things like that so he had come in\nAnd he was trying to retire in the next three to four\nMonths I was his goal and when we started to talk about I had an advisor to it I did have an advisor that he did he was working with we sat down in the conference room I could just see in mark size and even in jeans size because mark has had a lot of stress you know in his career trying to balance he owns his own business he was the sole proprietor\nTrying to balance all these different jobs and he was actually being hands on and some of these jobs as well because he needed to do that I couldn't\nFind help and things like that and you know gene who's getting the kind of the brunt of a lot of the ... you know the ... the late nights and things like that so there's a lot of stress on both of them and therefore you know as a sole proprietor you said you know what I I've had enough I think I've saved enough\nMoney that I could step away from this business\nAnd either salad or dissolve it depending on the value and I said okay\nFor his main goals Keith ... where the mark and Jean say they want like what would be a certain amount of income to David amount of money\nSo the main goal was you know he needed to generate about a hundred thousand dollars a year and all we had was Social Security so really he just needed a hundred thousand dollars a year so probably about Seventy thousand sixty Seventy thousand off of his ... portfolio at that point however you know we started to talk and said look you know a hundred thousand dollars\nIn two thousand ease a lot different than a hundred thousand dollars and two thousand and Eighteen sure so we we do need to account for inflation and Jean definitely had some concerns\nWhen it came to health care because they were going to be retiring early they needed maybe a little bit even more income up front to supplement and to get them in you know ... to get the health care paid for four in the early years before they get on to Medicare and how much that they face head of a one point of this round up to about one and a half\nMillion in assets that they put away a lot of it was pre tax that he'd been putting away through his company and things like that so we sat down\nAgain they they were about a month to month and a half two months away from retiring\nSo what we did is you know took into account the goals that they were trying to accomplish and you know I said look there's a couple of different things that we that we can do for you to limit limit let's take a step back was set up another time for you guys to come in\nAnd let us do what we do for for the families that we work with which is\nWe want to take a deep dive into the holdings that they had in the account to give them the potential upside that they can make it a good year in the market and the potential downside did they could lose we also want to assess and take a look at any underlying costs beyond what the advisor was charging them to know what we wanted to do is say hey look you know\nYou have about Ninety five percent of your assets directly in the market in about five percent down to local bank and cash or cash like alternative we needed to develop a strategy that when mark does retire and his wife said to mark and Jean we need to know where your your money or your paychecks going to be coming from\nIn the short term or even ... throughout retirement what we did we set up another time for them to come down is really nice to kind of take us to step in and take a look at that because they're advisor they they had been working with and never talk to them about building a plant\nWill keep in two thousand seven and eight ... we were coming off a few good years in the market so at the time was that a concern of there as well they can certainly care I don't want to lose part of this one point five million\nBrought that up to them I had to you know you have to yeah because ... like just like we're seeing now you know ten years\nInto a bull market run the market doesn't go up every year forever right that's where we have a very\nOld bull right now I mean literally it's the oldest bull market in recorded history as it's not the strongest but it is the oldest for a long\nTime so I mean it's you're naive to think it's just going to keep going and that's what I I didn't say that to them but in my mind I said look\nIt's my responsibility as advisor to show them the upside and the downside so when they came back with the results so when they came back you know do good news is they weren't paying a ton of fees no that wasn't a big deal to them and that wasn't a big deal to me all however we did address I did take a look at I did want to educate them on the the fees that they were paying\nHowever ... was a little alarming to me was\nThe amount of risk that they were taking in their portfolio you know what a good year they stood to make about thirty two percent in a negative year they stood to lose about thirty so I was like whoa you know that that's you know that's a big down trying to think about that used to give blood sweat and tears one and a half million dollars if you lose ... hundred thousand\nYeah if you lose five hundred thousand dollars that that's a big downturn\nWhat they did is they actually you know showing the planned shorten the income strategy exactly how we would build out their plan reduced some reduced some risk give them some upside but also get what we call that paycheck or that mailbox money whether it's through the market or other avenues\nAnd they had enough to go to had it in all their goals perfect you know their retirement would've been a clear nice concise picture\nWe've been able to manage it for them they took a step back\nWent to visit with their advisor and their bodies are kind of talk them off the ledge cast for lack of better way of putting it and left the instead let's leave it where it is sort of member\nHim saying or her with the advisor but they said it was too conservative right correct taking too you know you're gonna miss these big years in the market\nIf you go to strip right and I would I turn around and said hey look when you retire to both

else and I am pushing and then I prove myself and then I went and got my real estate license and now I kinda do both okay well I Would say\nYou should try it if you don't try and you don't know\nI must be just as your mom now okay and not as big as\nThe daughter I'm\nWhat you have to lose by what she did ask you first question was do you feel\nCause your mother's a powerhouse is that what the insecurity is that you think that you can't be like your mom let you won't make it to her level that you are not as good as I in architecture was your mom where's the insecurity lying here\nIt's just a lot of pressure only because she's just so good at what she does\nBut you're young how do you know you won't be better than her\nI have no idea\n[laughter] to be honest I thought to never really cross my mind to be better than me no to that day I felt\nNo one's ever going to be better than me so I'm sure [laughter] I'm playing okay listen power in the way to launder Queen Elizabeth hasn't given up are thrown yet neither am I. O. J. [laughter]\nNo I Would say that yes she is a powerhouse and I think I used that more towards my advantages disadvantage ... like if someone says to me or your mom's any simple my responses yeah what are you going to say about it\n[laughter] and usually it's not something that I Know she usually goes okay what's coming next okay\nI don't know I look at is your mom pushing you to go down this field\nYeah yeah she is\nI Would say I take a lot of heat being her daughter that like everyone thinks this was handed to me versus how far heart I really work for it it does work and I get told a lot that I thought you were just a spoiled brat that gets everything handed her and I don't really like I say that to people who are very nationally grind for all on me all the time or nothing like I thought wow\nYet they always say that measure what they think she's going to be just like me and she was really nice she's the nice ones not lately she's a good which on the bed which actually lately she's kind of ... and everything she and turning into my advice and famous advice I think is lean towards the same way you've got nothing to lose\nBy trying it you know and\nYour mother's going a lot of knowledge there absorb it take it you're young enough in three four years if you decide you know it it's not the avenue I Want to go down change it up I mean the ... the true answer is that I work for another broker before I came home and pushed my mom to let me do this\nYou know and I was like yeah but I Am I'm a build them not a broker but and so you learned building what's Sammy was saying just beginning also was\nYou knew more than what you thought correct and you might know more than what you think to hear just being around your mom's so much okay oh yeah I have\nTo remind myself I Need a piece of paper that says I'm Cindy simple Ulysses ...

C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never so [noise]\nAnd then like a scene estate planning maximizing what's left to the next generation as efficiently as possible in ... as we know\nIt's not the differences everyone that you hear on the radio I we were the best at Social Security planning we do investments we do legacy here what we do our five step process is all at one spot\nOftentimes people ask me if I went into business so why did we go independent in ... we found there's multiple reasons for that but we found that there was just a lack of comprehensive planning out there that you know is that about certain people on the radio that they would focus their specialize on this or specialize on that I mean\nWhen you study the industry you find out that the people that have ten million dollars and more they're getting all of this detail they're getting all this focus\nWell everyone deserves that everyone is listening to the show deserves the attention to detail to make sure they have mapped out income plan and investment all those things that you were just mentioning and that's why when independent why we formed S H pay\nAnd chief as you know what I mean and this the three of us a few years ago and we've been lucky enough and blessed and we thank God every day that we have this company and his team in place in the clients are so great that we deal with every day\nThat we can sit here and coasts and not take on one more client and be okay but we decided this is what you know when we do different trainings across the country in different areas that we work with we see that we do have some that's different and we do have something that can actually help people\nAnd help you listening get too into retirement it's not just fluff that we're here talking on the radio to repeal proven process that can help folks build a plan and give them confidence as into retirement Keith\nWas funny 'cause one of the biggest questions we get asked when folks come in and visit with us is when I retire what is my retirement could look like and just sit down and go through their whole plan comprehensively built out an actual income strategy and investment strategy\nAnd then take a look at everything from attack standpoint [noise] make sure that the health care is taking care of and then the final piece is make sure that you know when that time comes many many years down the road and there are no longer with us is that money is transition to the next generation it empowers them in a given the big C word as they enter retirement confidence\nWell it's it's amazing chief in in the best way I can tell the listeners or or just explain to you want the power of this retirement road map process can do um I had a couple that I met with literally two years ago\nAnd it was billionaire Angela and they had about five hundred thousand dollars saved to retirement and they're both sixty four at the time and one of the first questions I asked them which is one of the most common concerns that we see is\nWhen do you want to retire when is your target retirement date and you know what their answer was keep them out\nTo will never be able to retire I Am or where they said look me in the eyes so we're never going to be able to retire it you know I'm almost embarrassed to be here because we haven't saved enough money for our situation\nAnd said well let me just crunch the numbers for let me take some time and see what we can do ever angel said listen we only have five hundred thousand dollars I Know I Know we're not going to be able to make it can just tell you man keys\nThat they were able to make it in this is what I Love about this industry is ... being the bearer of actually good news as opposed to being the bearer of bad news and I saw in their idea was to retire by ... sixty eight which they knew they couldn't and they say we may still work you know until sixty eight\nBut we saw that said you know we can actually build a plant where you can retire in two years at age\nSixty six and guess what happened a few months ago that they they retired\nOr ... them\nAnd now they do things like the the neat part about it I was just talking to her the other day and now they're setting up trips a family trip they've always wanted to take their doing things they never imagined possible just by because we took the time and they took their time to do what they picked up the phone and called and called us\nAnd so that's all that that's all that it took and I love working with awesome families and I love working with people that initially think they have no chance of retiring and being the bearer of good news and saying hey guess what\nLet's look at your information you actually can retire and here's when you can do it that's the best part of our job so as you are listening right now does this sound like you is that a concern that you have of whether or not you can retire at a certain point it's so let's take a look at your situation to see how much

H. B. financial done gum no here's your host very\n... so today we're\nWalking you right through our retirement ... step plan that can help you get too into retirement in his help so many clients that we work with\nGet too into retirement and since we open the doors to S. H. P. financial way back in two thousand three myself Keith ... started this and like we mentioned earlier folks\nWe can we say a few years ago he said you know we could sit back and coast and just keep the clients happy and maintain our client base but we want to help more people that's where a passionate about and we have a process implanting tool that can help you get to and through retirement so why not continue to utilize it\nSo when the first segment we talked about number one ... one of our five step planning process which is building an income plan you can't have a retirement unless you have an income plan that delivers that monthly mailbox money each and every month to last as long as you do step two of our five step process\nIs an investment plan she might be thinking\nEveryone has an investment plan everyone has investments that ... you know you have mutual funds stocks bonds annuities alternative investments\nAll these other areas but the most concerning thing that I see when it comes to investment planning is controlling volatility\nWith in your portfolio let me see it again the most important part of investment planning when you're getting close to her in retirement is to control the amount of volatility or you know huge potential down swing potential in your portfolio\nAnd I mean that can be the difference between success and failure for many people listening to the show\nNo absolutely not a great way of summarizing that is that when you when you enter retirement until about ... hidden singles you know what I'm trying to hit homeruns anymore we're just trying to be consistent\nYou know and made me think of a you know a couple of clients that came in recently Brian ... you know Brian was a carpenter Michelle was still working and she was had a commute that she hated I mean she was literally going to shore\nUp to the north shore on a daily basis and was just as unhappy as as can be and so they they were nervous too when they came in because Michael just recently been laid off from a job and he's kind of doing odd jobs and doing carpentry work\nAnd he was just saying All right well I you know all she has four one K. and it was all in the market at that point and so we obviously we uh we did step one which is to set up their income plan and talk about okay if he if he collect Social Security now okay and if you continue to work and\nAnd what it is that we set it up so that you know in anywhere from six months to a year's time if the commute was just too much for her then she would retire at that time\nBy cutting that four one K. out of ... not just the growth bucket now from cutting that for one case into some into a big chunk of the income you know fixed income ... things like that and the other chunk we let grow\nWe just said look you know Michelle it no matter what happens if there is a market correction there were any time that is going to happen to the next year you will not be impacted by\nIn other words the market is not going to dictate when that commute is too much for you if you just don't want that commute we've set it up so that we used to have your portfolio so the minute that you are done working\nThen we know exactly what bucket when we're going to withdraw money from and exactly what money were no let grow so that winning that volatility kicks in and then that correction happens it does not affect Michelle and Brian's life\nAnd that ... having when when she left the office after telling her that and then you know good doing reviews you know after plans establish it's just it's it's so nice to reminder\nYou're like oh no no in in that she retired ... ... that's funny so then literally about a couple of weeks ago I spoke to a recently and she ended up getting transferred in in ... ah on to the south shore so now she's now she's like I'm at I'm gonna work for a couple more years\nFrom ... imagine her feeling knowing that she's going to work every day knowing that she can stop when she wants exaggerating that is a much better way to go to work then to wonder like a lot of people are wondering right now of hey how long it might have to do this for\n... ... ... ... absolutely and also to just to be able to\nWhen I was talking to her about how she just got transferred to a shorter commute just saying but look you know show don't worry about it if the ... it just always felt so good for me to tell her to remind her\nThat hey if the market falls don't worry about it we have a plant yeah so I was able to tell her what happens you know so when all this market stuff happening all his news hitting and everything else I can say here here's what it means to you and it doesn't mean much because we were able to set up the portfolio to set up the investment planned the right way\nCorrect and a lot of people that come into our office you know we still use the market as a tool for many of the folks that we work with it's a good long term investment strategy but if all of your money is subject to full risk keys\nThat's I mean think about if you're fully in the market you basically we wake up\nEvery single year knowing you might make forty percent\nOr you might lose forty percent so if you're a million dollars yeah might make four hundred this year or I might end up next year six hundred thousand which is almost half of all the money I've said to my entire life and so to me that's the first thing when it comes to of what we call the volatility control I mean you worked your entire life to get\nTo this point why are you taking chances and do you know did you even know that there are strategies\nAvailable right now where you are we utilize all the time where you can take advantage of the upside of the market and but you're not going to take the same downside risk\nIn a lot of clients we tell them every single day I said listen I'd much rather and hope if this is you're listening right now take take take this into consideration 'cause maybe we're not the right from because here's a conversation I have some times hey Mr Mrs Jones I'd much rather you'd be mad at me because the market's up twenty and you're only ups fourteen percent\nThan to be mad at me because the markets down forty percent and so are you in your retirement is over and you have to go back to work peace I mean that's that's the whole deal right jeeze\nA hundred percent it's controlling the volatility it's setting up the plane correctly\nIn our philosophy since we started building up these retirement a road map says you need money for safety money for income and once you have those two buckets built which to me I kind of draw a line in the sand there and say look safety and income\nWhat have you protected you protected your lifestyle that's awesome that's a that's a that's the biggest thing\nWe're trying to do for the folks that we work with this look like Matt said earlier with his clients and he gave them the ability to say look I don't want to drive to the north shore anymore if either one I can walk away if I Want to it's a liberating experience you know\nWe're helping them protect their lifestyle now once that's done you have that third bucket which is growth\nThen what goes into a bucket for growth is determined on a conversation between us because we have some current clients that are a little bit more maybe on the aggressive side in that growth bucket but then we have those clients that are still more conservative\nBut we don't want the growth bucket to affect you know whether you can take a trip that year or whether you can go visit your grandkids or whether you can buy a new car or whatever it is you're trying to do on a month to month year to year basis\nWell simple symbol that will keep the same right there is you need time in the market if you're going to be in the market you need time\nSo our clients for only advise and the only a portion of their money that we have invested for them stays in the market and we use other alternatives when it comes to\nGetting their safety getting the income they need you know you don't want that to be marketing generated because if it's all in the market and you a million dollars and you retire and the next to your six hundred thousand what is that going to duty or retirement", "show_name": "SHP Financial Retirement Road Map Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day":
