nine one one call okay you know it's a finite amount of resources that we have yes we're the wealthiest country on earth and we earned it\nThe hard way we're our resources are not finite\nAnd the rule is you always live below your means you don't blow the budget on things that are unnecessary and illegal immigrants illegal migration illegal invasion is on necessary\nAnd I go to you we have Joe in mail is hello Joe you're on the air\nGrieving worries affairs tiger Michael welcome to you know [noise]\n... legal immigrants to do our jobs is I'm born out of a generation of generation of entitlement classes coming out of our educational system I'm costs kids coming out of our schools don't want to do the grunt work\nRight they've been taught to ... to ... work ... they're trying to sacrifice I've read things should be handed to them and we're class of Democrats out there promising them [laughter] you goodies\nRight Joe like they're too good when I was sixteen I was watching uh I was a cook at Pizza Hut and part of my job was to clean the bathrooms both men's and women's ... at the end of the night I clean all the pants and they even give me a pair of gloves\n[laughter] Murray's work [laughter] when I was twelve years old I was cutting grass for fifty cents an hour there you go you know it's ... it's crazy\nAnd you know if we could just still a work ethic back into our younger kids ... you know we have the manpower need of\nCourse you know it doesn't take much sport illegal immigrants working our country a lot of them look up on the rules all of them are doing all of them work yes for me the\nContractors want to pay them under the minimum wage and under the table and so they don't have to pay a payroll tax and it's just a giant sucking drain on the economic power of our country Joe\n... and ... in our kids ... you know we're going to order tore a Porsche where we're not going to have\nEnough people to to work that war war boom one other point I wanted to make ... you know do we illegal immigrants they rarely in this country to get their benefits right in front of our ... ... um\nUm they wore a driver's licenses right or want to be able to vote\nRight I mean I Do not want to be governed by an illegal everywhere now I just don't want it out of work but in my tracks is to um a form of government is run by a legal sorry excuse me I'm an American I Want to be governed by Americans\nA trend that is apps that is a pretty straightforward requirement Joe and most of many people feel that way it is atrocious to think yes that it may be people out there don't know that you're referring to San Francisco is actually\nLooking to let 'em illegal aliens vote in school board elections which is just preposterous right it's like Joe\nWe okay for the ... the Supreme Court rule is that if if a kid is here legally that we have to\nEducate them right okay so now these kids are in school and we're paying our tax dollars for them to get educated but that's not enough Joe right when they their kids these kids are illegal and they're getting an education for free on taxpayer dime but that's not enough so that now they want to have now they want to have parents of\nThese kids be able to vote and election\nYou know what it costs are educated the kids in school you know we're ... return Fifteen I Know there are some dollars a year per child\nRape and then they say like oh well some of these kids they some of these illegal aliens their kids are citizens yeah okay so what what's your point there still illegal they cannot vote because you know what happens next Joe today to a school board in San Francisco tomorrow it city council in New York City then it's state by state right this encroachment\nStay we're just we're just [laughter] you know they really pay taxes I don't consider paying six and a half cents on a hamburger attacks well\nYeah they neither do I do but they said people they dismissed this can ARD that they pay that they have a dummy Social Security number and their pain payroll tax like that is a it does happen but it is so infant test and Lee small it's a joke most people work under the table and we all know that\nWe're living housing and they're out there competing were people that are paying the bills are paying the health and welfare the pay and I'm I'm the right amount of taxes to pay and Social Security checks and they don't have\nA southern dependence so that they show that the taxes they pay a minimum to begin with\nRight we're just being it's being stuff down our throats Joe and this is why I wrote the op ed that I wrote and actually my next one I'm going to have some more I'd have to solutions and this one you know it's pretty simple National Guard at the border and shut down the border in Mexico feel that pain\nHas to be with for some type of force [laughter] I mean sure the say but\nYou know I mean no it's we don't it doesn't have to be you know nothing lead let's be clear nothing lethal it's very simple National Guard stop them and then shut down the border Mexico is going to have to feel the pain of not help doing a better job of turning these people away and we're not going to let any of them come in legally until they help us\nAt ... wasn't too long ago they were using rubber bullets wrong [noise]\nNo I don't want to watch I don't want to talk about that I don't want to talk about I don't know I don't want to control on a grow I don't want to give that air time we can do things we are the civilized people not the barbarians but the other long term solution that is non lethal for sure\nIs a wall they'll the wall\nWell I I like to see what they do ... just on the\nBorder okay Joe don't make my job harder I don't know much Murray we have to go\nWith what I'm ... plan a pier and be cleared see because obviously players\nAstronaut well now no National Guard orderly turning away and shutting down the border for a ... amount of time to make people see that we're serious and we're not going to take the sitting down\nAre going to the new well that's I agree wholeheartedly to Mussa ... excellent thank you Joe have occurred you're okay but by okay everybody\nSo I'm just going to leave you with and going to leave you with this thought\nUm that is my two step plan\nBuild the wall support them all who are portable and like I said the wall is the most lethal way and non lethal pardon me the wall is the most non lethal way we have of keeping order at the border it will save lives on both sides because\nWe have to be cognizant of the lives of the border patrol um and do even though people are invading us we\nAre better than they are and we don't want harm to come to them we just simply want to turn them away and they need to go back to their country and if they find a legal way to apply that's fine but oh well it's\nThe best way the best way to stop this complete an\nHonor ridiculous nonsense happening over and over again and the last on I'm going to leave you with is how fraudulent asylum is and they're not even hiding it anymore the immigration American immigration Lawyers Association association rooted an email that\nThey um the practice of affirmatively affirmatively filing an application for asylum with the end goal of applying for cancellation of remove all has\nBecome a widespread practice\nLet me translate that for you you get cancellation remove all if you're married to a U.S citizen so what these lawyers do is they file\nA bogus skeleton asylum claim knowing it will get denied knowing that the person will end up in deportation court and then they will apply for the relief of cancellation of remove all\nThat's the trick I'm telling you the inside information keep your ears perked I Will

I think you and I have talked about this example before you are familiar just generally would poke him on characters correct ...\nAnd I cannot think of her name and it's not important to this conversation but the woman that does secret you mhm most popular character of all the gotta catch 'em all characters\nShe can only say her name he could you\nHow much she goes to the entire gamut of range of curiosity I'm not I'm not even going to attempt to say\nYou got you yeah I did it but\nYet or anger yeah or happiness or complete be funneled meant\nYes mhm and I'm thinking to myself this person deserves an Emmy [laughter] yeah with the\nHer name is her name is ... Kuwait autonomy\nOkay yeah and that raises really we've talked about her\nYeah yeah she's amazing and cheat so shy on camera it's kinda funny [laughter] she's she's like the most beloved carry she's the most beloved voice in the entire poke him on universe\nAnd have you met her I have not that not\nBecause I Love ... I Need to go to Japan again [laughter] well\nIf you ever do meter just give her a compliment from some unknown radio guy in Boston that she is totally under rated G. needs to get recognition for what she does and convince the\n... take a look at the second line and just read the words that are on their don't worry about acting just say them out loud to that the audience can hear what's going on with this line\nI Will never stop not until the day we returned to warrior and save our people\nOkay so let's take a look at who are are with red leaf is\nRight so he is if you can see if you see on the first page it gives you an overview of who he is you know I read all\nRight so he's a young man they describing this fiery and passionate and he's defending his clean and that's part of the deal they are beleaguered people apparently I Will never stop until the day we were turn to our ... and save our people All right so that's really all you need to know\nRight I have a question yeah\nIs a story of the same ... flash Gordon\n[laughter] probably not okay our our data or just start maybe could be okay I don't know\nYou know the the thing is that that's where they need to return to parent though\nWith an audition script that's really all you need to know if you were late to our border yet from flash Gordon than by all means you use that as your frame of reference sure it's your reference has to inform this line so we've got I don't ever stop exclamation point\nNot until the day we returned to our ... and save our people exclamation point now one of the things that candy Milo says\nAnd she's a famous actress a who's done a ... you know a thousand cartoons one of the things she says with an audition is you can\nDisrespect the punctuation okay\nSo don't worry about the punctuation necessarily it's not the only arbiter of how you see this line\nThey're trying to show you that he's passionate we've got exclamation points around most of what he says in this audition so [noise] you know what is the point is we want to say this line I Will never stop [noise]\nNot until the day we returned to our ... and save our people okay so part of what you need to do in an audition Morgan is figure out I Will never stop I'll never stop what what does he responding to they don't give you context All right\nOkay so so let's let's play an imagination game who's just said something to him\nThat makes him respond like this and so you have to think of what was just said to me what just happened that made this line come out from me\nSo he says I Will never stop someone had said to him or you have to stop this nonsense start behaving\nThe way I Want you to\nYeah like the court here you are you know stop behaving like a warrior and behave more like course here you need to stop this war like behavior so someone who's just scolded him\nOkay meet up to them like they're\nNot at all\n[noise] so how would you if if you were looking\nTo defend yourself against the school day I'm going to give you would've called action words I'm going to give you something that we call in a theater we called them objected okay or and and in in general ... voice acting we tend to call them actions okay so I Am looking asking you to defend\nYou've just been scolded still read this line to defend yourself OK and go\n\nI Will never stop not until the day we will turn Tora Bora and save our people do you want to stay\nIn that okay I thought I told\nHim that's fine I'm OK let's do this again do not underline the word we okay 'cause we can do that you can if you want to put a heart around our boreal you may because that's the that's the goal [noise] now what I Want you to think of to not just defend\nBut I Want you to incite I think that what does that mean to you to incite\nI'm going to take a stick and poke into the lion's cage\nWhere you go and so begin with I Will never stop and go\nI Will never stop not until the day we returned to ... and save our people\nOkay so your seat you can really tell how different your energy was an ad yes\nVery different now I Want you to think of how you're actually delivering these lines and I want you to to think of being able to be a little more fluid with the musicality of this so let's move on to another line Let's hook line for\nI was looking for that when you ...\nSo let's look at wind for it's a nice life says\nTo just read the line from ... from forming content\nI don't like doing this but this is war they may have started it but I went to finish it\nOkay now so the the in the general uh urgency for this line would be if you looked at this and you did it with the with the first passion that came to mind you would think it was ... or sad or animal like okay you would think that\nSo given that to me in a in a I'm In a in a manner to complain\nOkay to ... to lament\nI think I can do that yeah All right\n\nI don't like doing this\nBut this is war they may have started it\nI'm going to finish it\nOkay so that the that the tire guy seem a lot of action now let's change this up a little bit okay I Want you to dismiss the person you're speaking to the person that you're speaking to had said something you ... do I am disregarding here\nHe said something he the person who has spoken to you\nHad said something about how ... the it is to take up your weapons and kill your enemies\nOkay and what our wick is saying is that's not why I'm doing this so what I Want you to do is dismiss the person that you're speaking to be a little\nOkay and then you have to be the last time because we're going to hell bent on top of the hour\nI Know so be quick about the delivery of the line and dismissed the spokes person you're speaking to be dismissive\nDon't like doing this but this is war they may have started it but I think to finish it\nWas completely different and that's what we ask view when we do casting\nI'm going to keep these lines and keep practicing [laughter] one of these days I'll be in front of you and the way around a table and other people and I'm going to do the best to his press\nAnd I'm sure you will be magnificent\nThe beef thank you for coming on and it was a political I haven't had\nOne in a couple of years and of course I pick the night the red Sox become world champions to do this yeah bad turning on our part but that's OK\nOkay but we had fun and there

Jones and [noise]\nYou know when George George Scott Rico better Sally and red Smith I'm very jealous that back\nOn a new Reggie Smith [noise] um but I don't remember memory is such an interesting thing to make [noise] and I took a few pictures which I still have from that game you know I'd probably on\nThe ... and I have the scorecard of a gentleman you'll probably know this who played right field for the cardinals in Nineteen sixty seven\nBillion Williams nope nope and I have no memory of seeing him play but I kept a scorecard [laughter] you know I mean everything he did it back that day and have no memory of seeing him but I Know\nI Am I gave you Billy Williams because he was a curb Roger Maris yes\nThat's exactly right right and in retrospect having no memory of actually watching Roger Maris play at that game I'm kinda thrilled that I watch can play even though I Can't remember it chill it's very strange\nOr if I'm not mistaken Roger marris\nWas from Missouri I think that's right and didn't he he ended up I think he was released he stayed in Missouri after he was with the car does I think he got a a a a a dealership from or was it ... Bush I'm not sure\nI went to work for them um but he was just a tremendous ballplayer and you know that that achievement in Nineteen sixty one I think is one of the you know the great achievements in in in the history of sports and the pressure that he was under\nIn Nineteen sixty one but I just find it funny that I you know kept a scorecard for the whole game and to this day have no memory of of watching him play that game but it was you know very exciting to be there [noise]\n[noise] so have the steak off I'm Sorry to hear that no worry about it well hope\nHopefully folks will call it a chick from seven to five or ten thirty or a or a one eight eight let me see eight eight eight nine to nine ten thirty\nYou do that very well you think you've been a gift for\n[laughter] [laughter] and you can call in and talk with Morgan about uh the great victory today or the world series pastor you could talk about Nineteen sixty seven like Donna did um ... your favorite player of all time if I'm not mistaken\nTony ... was the great Tony can ugly arrow yeah he was just tremendous\nAnd then more cameras and microphones and Tony sees\nTo North shore bar mhm and obviously there were people there and joined the game and every now and then they would they would throw it\nTo the location just to get actual wealthy so yeah of people eating and drinking you enjoy watching the Arabs are\nYou know I still think of all the players from you know I mean decades ago [noise] um well I guess you know as at certain ages you know when I was you know most obsessed with baseball and and you know was following it all the time I mean I think people like you know Dick rabbits oh my heavens\nThis this imposing incredible figure\nAnd they let him go and sixty six was his last year\nI forget where he went to Detroit oh he went to Detroit okay\nCan you imagine had they kept him to sixty seven\n[laughter] no I Can't I mean it it seems I don't quite understand why they would have let him go but uh uh he was such a tremendous pitcher\nJessie weren't the monster was it not that was his nickname\nYeah and I think of ... ruled Wilson and you know a a un Donna is that the previous caller mentioned Jose ... and the the the famous play from Nineteen sixty seven dollars an hour it in Chicago in Chicago\nI forget the runner who was a third can something term Barry can bury and that's just one of the most exciting place I've ever seen in my life yeah\n... really pulled that off I think one of the announcer he's got a weak arm here comes the throat of the plate\nAnd we know how would jump really high cart and slept with her daughter\nSlap the tag down it was the one of the most exciting place I've ever seen I think at that in one of the Boston papers at the time if I'm remembering this

I don't think they'll ever to build something with an all star something years is good player and nobody could come in and feel the ball bear head and and get it over the first like a bunker or slow Lola\nHe was good at that it's terrific that tries to think of every inning late innings when he did it for a pretty good average most of the time but it would always be a pop up when he needed to win the game but do you remember that Frank you always hope because he knew he had some power but also he could he could hit well for average but it was pop out oh\nYeah I ... what kind of idea isn't this edition very aren't they just what a keen should be\nAnd that's the ... are just lazy\nYup and I'm thinking as I'm waiting on the phone to talk to you guys when you think of the Boston teams on TALK of the all the Celtics the bird error Celtics and even wanna later and when you're thinking of\nThe red Sox for this year and other years and when you're thinking of ... or the other and see what the ... of course the Bruins I guess\nThey're a team they there are some years there really a team oriented thing\nAs the result six and and and the patriots of course our team all the way where all the way a team\nOf ballot checks got them being a team [noise] just says is in court amazing you don't even realize how amazing it is to do it with all those different kinds of guys are all good but to get them all to\nBuy into a team even for one year\nAnd that the whole thing about Boston in at least my life in history as\nIt's mainly a team thing and it really is you know a team will team play it all the sports\nOvershadows overshadows the the tremendous individual stars although we've had a number of stars but it overshadows world that it gets something special going even I mean he conceded baseball\nAnd you can see it in basketball but you don't really you don't really think of it too much in football I mean ... realize of course but I or my random parts\nNice to see it good good team that just came back for the call Bye bye Bye bye and Julia week let's go to Steven Steven\nCard Oregon Hi Andrew static back in the day my dad was an avid Red Sox fan and in those days they would have family night stand\nWay so they would have ... that my dad would get a reserve grandstand faith for two fifty\nAnd I would sit next to him for fifty cents and it was absolutely incredible\nWhat years are we talking about here well we have to be talk at work I'm Seventy\nFour now so we have to be a while that was probably add to be in the late fifties if I Would say maybe early early sixties I remember ... ... ... miles long and Germany would it be playing catch what\nEverybody out in the in the seats are way out in the field I I think it was correct I think in the past ...\nAnd the grants am and uh it was amazing and they would do that about\nTwo times a year and um they would START I think it was like five thirty six o'clock and it would go on to ... to ... midnight the two games for the same\nPrice and uh those days are gone they never they never read or write or call the ... farm but if I had a twilight or a double that are a few guys to\nPeople at Dodgers stadium the other day they got to see to gain all\nWe did [laughter] at abs absolutely and I sat right through there till about three thirty I watched it and uh there was a it was really amazing and they uh they did quite well a fantastic so I'm looking forward to the parade on Wednesday\nAttached to hear your story about to go to the family night the family to the game that's really great\nI just wanted to share that with you guys both things are nice they buy stock or to make you buy buy\nBill I'm yeah ask Andrew I'm to condense is a little but that's how we met he wrote a book about his mother's singing career and Andrew tell people all about to ban it\nWell just very quickly 'cause I obviously want to get back to you know you're just a wonderful guy but a ... some in the Boston area might ... remember my mom as a team to personality or in part on W. busy in the Nineteen fifties and\nShe did voice overs for decades in Boston and a number of\nYears working as a singing in the Boston area but\nAh the book is primarily about her years as a network TV performer by a on NBC primarily from Nineteen forty nine to Nineteen fifty two\nSinging on K Kaiser's television show on NBC and your head parade on NBC\nAnd so that's primarily what the book is about the New York years but then my folks came to Boston in Nineteen fifty three and she sang on her own show and easy for a couple of people in Nineteen fifty five [noise] and it had a wonderful career in Boston first encounter these\nActually learning different things like that that opportunity no we're we're getting off the bat\nI'm I I don't hear any feedback I'm I'm home in Brooklyn\nI ...

right okay well no here's\nHere's what I'm hoping Joyce I'm hoping to keep keep it right you know I don't necessarily want to quit right now obviously I Want to I Want to keep it for a while\nBut what I see myself as transitioning out of nursing I'm hoping within you know maybe six months to a year we do have to chill condos down in Florida we have rented out what I'd like to do what we both like to do is get a phone call our v do some traveling around we have some money saved and just\nTo be able to I'm just so\nNervous I've been a nurse for thirty ... thirty four years to give up that security but at the same time I feel like you know and at the age where I\nYou know I Want to try I really kind of want to try my hand at the real estate and I feel like you know it's worked so far with the Congo is having good renters I'd like to kind of maybe flipped one of them\nEven like even if we can do and not to just kind of get by and maybe\nOne car underway era doing something enough to kind of have money for the kind of travel around at our RV and just like have our little house here in New Hampshire and travel around and make some money you know doing the real estate thing and eventually tracked a transition out of the nursing which\nOne's going to do it even though I'm only fifty seven is because my partner's sixty eight we don't we travel well and\nYou and another wait six months to see see if you still feel the same way because right now you're in the let me outta here\nYeah yeah but\nYou know and in another few months you may not feel that strongly and I mean I think you probably know the real estate's has seen as high\nRight and I don't think we have a\nCouple of good places down there now that that you know that we did buy when they were really low\nIt's like there's anything wrong with what you've already done but I think that the idea of\nBuying things in flipping them and making more money down the road is not like to be practical\nFor [noise]\nI mean so the stars they wake up once and it seems like today I think because you are right now we're in the height of like the villain the outta here but I Do think if you wait a few months you may find that\n... and you know settled back then yeah and you also have been working really hard to right yeah yeah I think I think the combination of being restless and\nAnd having the job being more demanding as long as you wanted to hear it in the\nRight to be back with you know my friends and my girl at work and stuff like that but it's like I just it feels like it's an all again you know to me like I I just don't see myself doing that for another five or ten years and by that title of the older and he's not very well\nAgain I Would just I just wait six months and see the same way\nSo that you have consulted the great article Gail and she has told you to wait six months I Know that's not what you want to hear but that's the way that charge a lay it down\nReally in Rhode Island thanks for hanging in there Roy how're you doing\nFine good morning a Bradley good morning Joyce how we'll good um I have two concerns yeah I'm trying to hold on to my house I'm a blind individual I'm retired I'm On a fixed income and two thousand nine my mom was my mom was gracious enough to leave me my house\nWhen nobody else wanted to leave it to me I'm I'm In the process of trying to refinance and my question is I actually have two questions you have the one and what does that look like for me I'm very I'm really worried about my independence I want to stay here\nHas a legitimate reason for being around their window and I and I understand that I I feel like taking care of her mom to\nShow her mom is in a facility\nYeah no we don't want her there anymore it's just a I live has it not evil tournament take care of a you know she's in a facility we get to pick up three or four days a week and it's you know the kid that we give her is so much better than the care that she gets at the facility\nSee it's upsetting you go out to go up to New Hampshire and keep your in your care all the time yes exactly so you know we have families fighting is you're you have other members of the family fighting it\nYeah exactly okay\nLet me just say this you may be getting into more than you think you're getting into like doing\nWell yeah well I I Know the the business opportunity is there\nNot not as if it isn't an opportunity I'm Talking about the ... the the full care of your mother in law\nOr we we did it for two years and it worked out really really good but she is and then and then what happened we were separated for a month because our family didn't want us taking care of her anymore because there's a tremendous amount of jealousy going around because\nYou know her mother started really you know growing up so much that she was I don't know ... you know appreciating her her caregivers\nWhat is their and their heritage and stake here\n[laughter] yeah but that's yeah yes and ... a ... a quite a large one and that's that's you know that they you know like I I'm being a painted as a you know after ... guy and I mean that has nothing to do with it nothing that you know I\nCare about her yeah and that's all you know I'm a I'm I'm like my own money I'd always have I always will so I'm I'm not really\nLet me say this I think you've got trouble with the family no matter what you do\nThat so that I said I caught caught defined as you\nDo you know I'm just looking at your cycles and they did it won't get better at least not in the near future\nSo did they take care of her ever if you if you don't do they step up or is it always use it has to do it\nI we used to ... or if it wasn't for us taking her out she would never go out of the place you know\nNot only that the worst thing about a Braley is is you can tell when we get her like she's ... she's at the facility Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and usually we pick her up Thursday night and you can tell that from being in the facility\nShe doesn't get a um a fair amount of cognitive I'm\nA speech with anybody and you\nCan tell on on Thursday night she's very it's very hard to get out of the conversation but by Sunday night she's doing pretty good you know sentences and ... it's really it's\nIt's hard it's hard to deal with it so you were taking care of before ... at this similar stage of ... of of ... illness\nYou want to do it\nThey don't do it\nI don't see why they have a say\nI mean I think you're going to have trouble with them no matter what you do but I Am concerned that you might be taking on more than you think you're taking on in New ... you'd find that out later\nWhile you're there you can\nYou can always jump bail out on it I mean that would never happen but ... and in the end there's a lot of complaining and knowing that she's with people that lover as opposed to you know high people that the you know it's just it's tough to pick her up her hands dirty and\nShe can't talk they're good and by the time you bring 'em back her hands clean and\nShe's talking now she's talking about a joy says if you're going to do something to do it quickly right yeah I think you know if you're going to do it I mean I wouldn't\nYou know you I think you need to do it in the next year\nOh yeah as far as when with mom yeah what do we ... I mean that's that's happening and that's being costs through legal or you know we've been pushing it through the court system now and I mean we're just winning everything in court now because of realizing that you know we're doing the right thing for her\nAnd then the only other thing is you go up to New Hampshire that's the only thing you're questioning about\nYeah well you know she has a place up in New Hampshire so we can go up to her place but that's just kind of make you know Jim bringing the jealousy all my family like got\nA ... you know what have you ever get to get the family because no matter what you're not going to please them regardless of what you do\nSee that that's what I'll be that's just stop trying they make you know I don't mean to be mean about it I agree I'm On I'm\nJoyce aside or just kind of science I just in the\nYou know if if there's something you can't do anything about then why then just dumping concerned with it\nYeah so you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't just don't even factor it in yeah that's exactly what I'm saying David right right you're good men tanks thank you okay somebody be easy\nWe have or do they give you a Tommy's information no okay tell me how you doing\nEd Bradley how are ya\nIt's how are you it's a pleasure to talk about you guys are you tonight\nI'm good how are you have time to sneak on doing great hold on to have any time he was born February Nineteen\nNineteen sixty five and nine twenty two PM\nAnd Wilbur now everyone knows that everybody does [laughter] telling me what can we do we only have a short time so let's try to be careful I knew that as\nI was calling enjoy what can you tell me about me\n\nYou know I mean you're ... you're very practical from places okay it's it's actually unusual um when do you do for work\nI'm actually a draw tender I Do I offer to drop rich but I've had several careers during my lifetime that on my own business very successful [noise] um but I at fifty three I kind of ... I kind of what sometimes I Wonder why I feel kind of not satisfied\nYou know what when you've done something you want to move on to the next thing it doesn't matter whether it's been that is so true\nSo I think that that I think the lack of being satisfied isn't so much where you are is more than if if you'll pardon the way of putting this kind of your nature\nI agree with that I think that with my whole life it's like okay I see that now what's next\nAnd you know I'm I'm On my second marriage for beautiful boys thank God they're very healthy and sometimes I find myself just sitting here like ...\nI hear that makes sense yeah like I said\nI mean well let me just say this relation Leon emotionally you don't want to be alone\nI'm sure yeah yes I agree with that but you also sometimes I Wonder if that sometimes I Wonder if that was spent mistakes\nWell I think I'm nuts and you know I'm I'm not saying it's a mistake or not a mistake I think it's just the way it is but I think at the same time there's a part of you that wants to check everything and just go take off [laughter]\nYou know let me ask you this um I've been married for Seventeen years to like Second Life yep [noise] and sometimes I look at this lady and I don't even know who she is\nLucy that\n... and ... and you don't know who she is or you don't know who you are with her\nWho may be bowl that's actually never looked at it that way you can be right\nDo you regret getting married\nNot at all believe it or not not at all that's what the that's why it's so hard to figure out not at all she probably takes good care of you right [noise] yeah I think she takes good care of herself\n[laughter] that's not such a bad\nAbout that yeah [laughter] shut up and start\nTo feel I guess alone\nOr what advice do you have for him I don't I don't know why I I I think it's I don't think it's her\nOK okay but that doesn't make it any less real no I'm not saying it does but I think that you know sometimes you look at sort of your circumstance and it's like\nYou know you think it's the circumstance when they could be the way you see things\nYou know what I think Tommy we have to go I think you ought to talk to either get rabbit I I think you want to wait wait wait you need to talk to your wife about this letter no the deal sea wife I'm feeling very restaurants it's probably me what can we do to fix this which probably there's some things you can do like go on a trip rather go to Jake Asian even afford I'd vacation get out of\nSound like a ...

you should be putting immigrants in federal prisons\nThat's no kind of environment shouldn't be taken away kids some kids have been separated from their family for weeks and months and they may never get back together that's that's that's should be a crime right there\n\nBut this caravan bothers me does it bother you managed to coach says they tried to stop them at the border with Guatemala\nBut about two thousand Central American immigrants swam a raft with across the river separating that country from Mexico from Guatemala they reformed in Mexico and they vowed to resume their journey and their numbers have swelled to about five thousand\n[noise]\nAnd I don't mind sending messages that look you shouldn't bother 'cause we can't get in\nA I feel kind of like a hard guy I guess but\nLet's if I'm going to be honest I don't want my life savings diminished taking care of other folks that super selfish I Know\nI guess I'm just super selfish but if that's not okay then that means it's okay for me to go and if\nFor somebody to come into this country and use my money to stay I mean I guess it's okay for me to hang on in somebody's lawn like some rich guys lawn down in Newport right I'm not allowed to go live in Denmark I'm not allowed to live on some rich guys lawn\nI'm not allowed to take steps that mine I'm not allowed to live places I don't\nBelong and they're not either\n\nIs that what I'm saying this stuff out loud and it sounds very mean\nAnd I'm trying to do it not with the anger that I hear a lot of you have you ever anger I think that's the way of making yourself feel better about it you get angry because deep down inside you trying to convince yourself that your position is right and you're kind of irritated by by yourself that was I have a self doubt on that how about you\nIt's not immediately clear where the additional travelers came from I guess because of than Mexico\nThey seem to be they seem likely to be people who've been waiting on a bridge over the

the rich people tax break for the rich take away your Medicare you know that's what's going on right the whole this is the whole thing very very briefly they've they make you afraid\nOf immigration\nWhich is a real risk and in ... in return for that in return for your electing them take care of the immigration as their favorite to you they will take your money and give it to the rich so I suppose if the deal right you like them\nThey're going to protect you from the he's in ... in Georgia on our borders just like you like but they're going to take your money and give it to the rich people don't you wish they protect you from the immigrants but not take your money and give it to the rich people in form of tax cuts\n\nOf course on the other side and the other side the liberals are never going to [noise] but they're not going to get much traction and tell you come up with a\nLiberal who strict on immigration get couldn't you have that I should say a Democrat who strict on immigration couldn't you have someone like that somebody that wants to get money out of politics somebody that cares about the environment somebody that understands the global climate climate change is real\nSomebody that wants to have rich people get tax more\n\nBut somebody who would protect the borders find me a Democrat who is a borders cause your language Democrat and I will vote for that Democrat\nIt ain't Liz borrowing it ain't some super progressive I don't know how it is maybe it's Joe Biden maybe that's as close as we get all Republicans wouldn't you kind of vote for

I Know there's so much corruption in the Mexican government but I mean what is that you think you know it was well ... what is it that Congress can do to really put ... on these Mexican officials\nTo make ... make it look like that they get a step up and they're going to take care of people out people\nYeah you know maybe I I kind of like what are your hands at some sort of sanctions we could just by Mexico and use it as a buffer zone really\nYeah yeah just covered with around ... wire once that then\nNobody's even radio transferred here to disaster with a refrigerated they will tell you about another minute is one of the thing about the president\nI can understand absolutely has someone would vote for the president how they would like him as a different deal I understand the necessity of voting for someone holding a nose and doing the people say I love that guy\nThat's a problem for me is one more reason at a rally in Montana Thursday President Trump praised rep for body slamming a reporter praised Greg June fourth day\nFor a\nBody slamming reporter and twenty sixteen\nYou know just be careful of what you were part of okay I'm In throughout history we've seen leaders encourage violence against folks groups of people including the press I'm not going to get into the names of those groups you can do the math\nIs not is not the way are approaching that we were there now wears the same of getting stages as\nThese are African regimes we see around the world throughout history it all happens the same way you find a common enemy\nImmigrants Jews whatever and you look the other way about concerning violence those those people start encouraging violence as those people\nIt's happened over and over and over again please be careful what you allow yourself to become part of a get you don't want liberals running the country I get you don't want\nImmigrants in the country I totally get it I'm On board be careful what you become part of don't be a sheep\n\nThere are there are leaders that will get what you want done that have so\n\nIt have a speck of human decency\nLet me see we have um\nFirst wow bang bang bang and in what state are you doing it\nBy Bradley I wanted to agree and part and disagree in part with what you were saying but what was being said about unions and corporations [noise] okay\nUm I guess the way I look at it\nYou know my lived experience is that all the organizations for what they are governments corporations unions religion academia international organizations once they get big they tend to act in very very similar ways meaning\nThey look after their own interests and they're not so much hostile to the little guy see I don't I don't think it's so much to corporations are out to screw people I think they don't care about people but I don't think anyone's do either or the government or anybody\nDo you belong to a union I I I have ...\nI was in college briefly I work for UPS led to join the Teamsters\nYeah I mean my experience is entirely different my union actually has looked out for me and this I worked at young non union stations and the union says make about three times as much plus I had a beef and they went to bat for me\nWhat you know I I think you're not understanding what I'm saying I'm not hostile ... I just I don't think I have any literature about any kind of big organization I think the principle of reacting in their own interests and I do think you're right this is the agree in part I think things in this country and I'm a\nWeb pretty ultra right where I think it's gotten out of whack I think how oh I've got too much power\nIn comparison to labor [noise] but I don't I it's not like I think ... I think if they if they have the upper hand they would be acting there would be looking at their own interest just as much as capital of\nPoint just in the interest of equilibrium when you like to see labor be a little bigger\nWell let me go back to my lived experience I don't think the ... local one Seventy insurers pretty Massachusetts or wherever I don't think they were ... you know wondering what can we do to help that out I think it was a very useful to have a big area meaning the Teamsters\nAnd a big corporation meaning UPS keeping one another in check okay that's what you want yeah\nYou don't want anybody getting too much power in ... you want to watch it all sort of in a way you think other and tracker cancelling each other out [noise]\nHit once you start drinking any\nAny flavor of cool a you know if you know this kind of organization or this kind of ... group is good and that one is bad I think you're I think you're falling into the trap of becoming a shape which is what you were saying a few minutes ago we're really involved as exercising judgment\nAnd people have gotten away because you can exercise judgment unless you think [noise]\nI hear you hey that's a good call and thanks [noise] sure [noise] I'm thanks for being up late and\nThanks with chicken into its edge in great call and most of the great call loved it now journey in New Hampshire or knees\n[noise] hey hey Hi Bradley I just saw it on our Republicans about or they want to take away I Am here I met a Medicare and Social Security [noise] yep\n[noise] ah okay we've had we've had a problem for two years and then we had Bush\nIt yes Republicans right\nI'm really talking about Mitch McConnell recently but uh yeah I mean it's okay but I mean\nThat does not have done the scent taken out of Medicare and under the Republicans not one Obama was and they took to pass to ah make unhappy with his Obamacare they took almost almost a billion dollars you can look this up nine hundred and ... he mounted after hours they took it out of Medicare\nTo pay for Medicaid and to pay for Obamacare and I've already seen a decline in like care\nTo pay for ... tell me about the decline in your care\nI just notice [noise] they they weren't fitting that just a little while\nThey're just not as they don't tend to be is how can I say it they they send you more to seem to be [noise] like I said before I go to the automatic when they went for like a physical they would take certain blood tests and stuff and\nIt seems to our it's a little more more paperwork and [noise]\nLike I Know for a fact it took a billion dollars out of Medicare you can't tell me it's not going to affect anybody badly and\nThat we have to put it into Obamacare and then you don't care has nothing you say you got worse\nThan is they they took it may in or out of Medicare your cat down there for a contract Medicare\nOkay so you got that okay I hear you point\nOut you know we keep keep rattling on they want to\nTry to take that and taking a penny out of it but the Democrats have that's a negative term Ernie pretzels\nOr understand is a factor\nFor me so you would say if you don't agree that\nThe Republicans in for big business and they are ... you don't agree that the Republicans for big business and not for you [noise]\nAll right I ...

guess there's they started noticing problem with the fridge would shut off which is a bummer who would do the breaker would flip\nAnd the regular controls the fridge and one outlet on the counter there was nothing in the lead over the counter so basically just the fridge 'cause that's a bummer turn it on Iran you know for awhile turned off again\nSo that's not good thinking oh something's wrong with the fridge probably dirty in the back\nOr maybe it's just old and needed replacing which is a lot right now like eight hundred bucks if there are a lot\nAnd so kind of struggling with that all weekend had a you know a lot of food in it of course didn't want to lose that food where a meal prep family we prep a lot of meals and stuck them in the fridge meatballs and\nMeatballs and beef stew and stuff like that and there was some lobster and there anyway so as time goes on it would shut offs faster and faster more quickly more and more quickly\nAnd after a while you would only be on for like five minutes and it would take off so basically it's just starting to melt so once that happened\nWhen she was too late and plug it\nAnd lo and behold the break are still clicked off\nTurns

an animal though\nNo wait\nGoing to make sure I have the right Gary I guess it's Gary in Edinburgh has a thing called the plant based diet is not the same as the beginner a vegetarian diet let's find out about it I Gary\nEither that's true it's not the same thing and doing the two months um do you have Netflix barely\nGot rid of it I had a I got rid of\nIt oh you got rid of it I think they just put it on YouTube but you're I'm sure a lot of it looks as if the it's called what the hell it it's a documentary about an hour and twenty but it's so I watched it and I said it makes sense to me and I was getting a lotta aches and pains I'm forty four years old but I Do I was gonna go on ...\nSo I did more research the book is called how not to die I listen to the audio version so it starts off with a preface is the guy writing this book is not making money off the book it's the same with this video that\nIt's not the same author or producer I should say and he's the person that defended Oprah what the comment he was only a college at the time\nEngineering meat government\nHurt me it was like meat will not go past my lips or something called ... let's again I don't know why it came up but she got ... sued by the meat industry\nI'll come and ah because three sales went down\nYou know gave some of the fact it's not her fault and she's influential I mean she's allowed to say I'm not going to eat meat right\nWell actually they get inside of this video what the hell's I'm kinda including that with the book because of this little story here yeah you're absolutely right and she should be able to say that but they sued and eat what's a court that the fence or this is Dr ... did you read when\nHe was a ... oh she didn't win yes I think he was a key part of that um but Dr ... when he was a child in the eighties or swimming around my age his grandmother had so many heart surgeries\nThis was a sticking point was made that in ... put it that she went to the hospital again let's say we can't do anything else for your scar tissue ups so you're simply going to go home and die\nShe was told us that sixty five years old she was wheeled out of the hospital while she was watching sixty minutes some time with the eighties she says and she hears about this plant based diet and they're starting it at a hospital in California which you don't need a hospital ward so she goes there and does that she walks out a month later\nHow long do you think she lived after that she took a wild guess she was given six months\nUntil Ninety\nI could do while you're pretty good I Would have guessed eleven twelve years she looked at Ninety six\nThirty one years okay so she had a heart scar tissue too much of it how does the plant diet fix that\nWill it reverses heart damage it clears up the artery it cleared up a plot so if you are overweight and you get your ideal weight you and I still have damage in our arteries coronary arteries ooh and this reverses all of that\nOkay so what do you eat\nYou eat everything that's\nAnd based grains a whole grains nuts at first you're like oh that's not much you go ahead\nOr how about a black means\nYes yes coaching and I was

B. C. news radio ten thirty [noise]\nLife changes very quickly these days and things get caught up very quickly\nAnd I noticed it and I noticed that at an adverse effect on my life\nOh there's just too much going on there's a lot of clutter there's a lot of toxicity not only in the food is we just heard from Gary but in what we see and I guess I'm going to do the Gary version of\nThe what we see how bad it is for us so I I started feeling kinda jammed up about two months ago about six months ago and really noticing it about a month ago and decided to do something about it\nAnd\nLet's see was roaring a note was Andrew in New York\n\nRecommended a book and that's it was a book that was about healing back pain but\nThe back pain in the metro pain and just a general anxieties oh bald bald up and the one thing as long as there's nothing\nStructurally wrong a lot of this book basically says unless there's something wrong with your back physically that you can see on an X ray then it's about things in your life that are scrounging you up and there's a much more direct link\nFrom the mental to the physical than you might say and I noticed that\nAt first I couldn't think of any things in my life that really problematic I thought I have nothing no problems I don't get what could be causing any sort of lack of serenity here I have no problems what's what's the matter with me we started looking around\nAnd there are things things that you don't think could cause physical issues that do for example the toxicity of the environment on line\nJust like fishing and see that's see that is online as toxic it's filled with\nCash mental carcinogens it's an unhealthy place to be I don't go on it any more except to do my duty\nAnd promote stuff actually I Will like post stuff I don't live there I promote things\nDo promote Jake Asian trips 'cause I Know you like them but I don't go I don't I don't interact it's unhealthy\nI think the just the format is on housing and itself not seeing somebody even not even sharing their voice just this isolation thing is not good but the way people treat the amount of hate online is physically unhealthy stay away try it\nAnd this television\nI watch TV but not I don't do television news I get my news from the radio and from vetted\n\nApps like the wall Street Journal app Chicago at the what's the big city newspapers a pie CBS\n\nIs it's much healthier for some reason what else oh lights we had a guest on the talks about the degree to which the blue\nLight from your from screens or wherever all around us is harmful and it really is not in the long term not in trace amounts but in the short term a lot\nOf blue bright light from computer screens and television screens and your work environment I'm sitting in front of three screens and then at a digital clock bright blue like blessing\nAnd for giant TVs blasting out white blue light so that's one two three four giant screens\nThree more computer screens\nAnd had a\nDigital clock white hot and muggy hot light and it ain't healthy I can feel it I've always been sensitive to light and very pleased at a new place the lightning in general and the new place has a yellow tend to it so I've been doing\nWhat I can to reduce the blue light I don't I don't think it's phoney baloney I think the problem is real I Will make sure that I have in the background in my computer screens is a nice yellow I I was reduced to Dennis Dennis and the contrast\nAnd then\nI use chrome a lot as a home page and that's ... visit white blue light unless you change and you can get another theme I got this sort of night sky was cause most theme you've probably seen it much better so I and doing what I can to reduce\nThe toxicity of social media\nIt's bad it is on the healthy and not to mention is stealing all your information it's not free their entire job is to\nGet your information we're going to give them the stuff we're going to get them hooked on it and we're going to steal their information we're gonna take it actually they're not stealing and they get you to agree to give it away\nAnd\nAlso the computer screens and also television dumped television there's this good TV and there's bad television watch good to speak about how you feel when you watch it is it satisfying\nIf it's not generally satisfying read a book he was seen them before reading there was something organically good about reading for for us\nIt's not I'm not going to give you the old man stuff about uh the screens or I like having the book in my hand\nIt's it's just healthier are printed pages how you're going to screen plus it doesn't smell to it plus you can carry it around reading and did three small books recently\nThe stranger by chemical catcher in the rye I never read it before and heart of darkness all wildly different\nIt's really cool to after you read it or before going to go on line on a screen on the screen that's nice and yellow to find out what the heck the book was about really what what was going on there it has a lot to it\nSo I'm going to be going down to the library and getting some books by and some books I definitely feel better physically and mentally better Marty's more serene\nLove it and maybe this food thing here I'm really not a person that that gets involved in radical stuff like this but it makes sense and so far it's true so maybe that diet

I Know I'm a ... and we've learned a lot and a lot about how we've inspired to make on the animal a lot of the ... the equal but I you know sharing the term used for the kinds of Eli\nI'm Wondering in your book you're talking about how the uh pre made since ... and ... on the structure of the sons of Italy\nWell I don't ... necessarily mentioned the ... the free masons in the book itself the sense of Italy itself had actually been found as was mentioned by you know a tally in Americans coming to the new world and\nDr ... who was somebody in a lot of ways to created something and he uses the terms liberty equality fraternity which could be correlated\nBut I think it a lot of ways the free masons themselves were much older organization I mean that they dated to the turn of the nineteenth century in Boston a call so have the grand lodge free masons\nBut you realize in some ways that this was something that was primarily more of an ethnic organization it wasn't something that actually talked about a broader sense\nBut what it did was to create a grand lodge of which than they were familiar lodges that were actually established so I think in some ways you're right they still have a correlation but I don't think there was any direct connection between the free masons and the sons of visually\nThanks Jeff thank you know\nYou see free nations who came in saying shortly after Eighteen hundreds you\nKnow even before because Paul Revere would actually service cursed grand master of the grand lodge of masons\nSo you know today when we look at the building but it's at the corner with us today trombone street in Boylston Street it's the ... of course it's\nThe right decision the original one bird to the ground the masons and the nineteenth century or bargainer fraternal organization that stole the virtues of liberty and equality\nBut Paul Revere was a major part of that but you do you what do you think of Paul Revere I mean he was ...\nBut he who was the patriotism of amity man he he was a he was the person that was very much into espionage and secrets and whatever that he has up well with amazingly\nWell he was also somebody who was Korea or he brought the Suffolk Resolves from built into Philadelphia and they were incorporated into the declaration of independence\nBut in the period of the Seventeen nineties when they were evolving into this free Mason aspect\nHe was the silver Smith and what does he do but he made all the jewels for the Mason file and today there still is a collection the masons were also given a lot of hair from Martha Washington when President George Washington died and Seventeen Ninety eight\nAnd of course Paul Revere made it a little ... a solid gold um earn that actually hold Seoul block of hair where's that it's actually in the masons museum I mean it's a wonderful aspect to have to realize is also museum and conquer too but\nThe grand lodge masons is something that I I always see them I I teach also at the urban college Boston and I parked the a very street garage\nAnd that's where the masons park so it was the men and did a jackets and I've always intrigued and I wanted to initially where are these men going and then of course I realized it was the ... I have to\nUh put on my map cap\nMay sonic lodge corner of Boylston ...

Abbas in your story and he's got he's written I'd say eighty two or three it's fuzzy now books because you're just one just came out and you just submitted another one\nAnd it's ongoing he's turning them out at the new ready to talk about little a child in American history with ... in low here we go hey Laila\nHey how are you a jet Bradley Jay and Anthony\nIowa well\nI I'm doing pretty well I talk a little bit more about print the Getty if I could sure um I remember when I was um when I was younger we had a a print the Getty was had a matter of fact shrink plant and all correct\nAnd um they uh had a wonderful restaurant there I can remember um when I was younger my parents wouldn't you know get all dressed up and they would go and then I as I got older um they ... they gave me the chance to go with them and then when I was dating I used to go with my boyfriend to the um\nPrints are to the point I think it was called the prince grotto rod\nAnd and they had gotten all types of things I can remember the ... the un chap when my father came home one night he said he had frogs legs I think to myself much meter frogs like my gosh what the heck is he\nI couldn't figure that out but um it was a great little place and ... and in point quite a few people here in the end of the uh low on and the ground so beautiful I can remember driving through were driving into the restaurant and it was always these lovely flowers and I guess they had a ... a caretaker named John Walter case sick I think his name was if I remember\nAnd he he had worked at print the Getty all his life and down and uh he he uh he uh had worked his way up and had hired a caretaker I guess it just do the flowers and keep the flowers in the ground impeccable they had a\nFountain and it was just it was such a great place on but it ...\nIn a in the late nineties the recording I guess was that now I think it was born and had taken over there\nThey um the manufacturing plant in Nineteen eighty something I I Can't remember exactly\nAbout prince was it did start print street in the north end but eventually the la ... family and then later by the time of World War two the company really took on new meeting when Joseph Pellegrino at a gun in some ...\nHis name I couldn't think of what his name [laughter] I Would agree\nAnd I was at Harvard but my father and I think one of the things is he was somebody who really market at the company and he became in some ways about justice spokesperson but he made print spaghetti almost ... because it was a household name there were many other manufacturers have dried pastas\nBut bell agreed it was somebody who has a lot of ways not only moved in of course created that wonderful factories law\nBut employed hundreds of people of all walks of life I mean they weren't Italian or Italian Americans there were everyone\nIn what he was trying to do in some ways was to make it into something that became a typical thing and I think they're campaigned in the Nineteen late sixties Nineteen seventies to create that bridge spaghetti night Wednesday that Boston was a masterpiece yes because it well it\nIt definitely it definitely was molded into the city of all I mean even at a ... breadth that said welcome to spaghetti bill I mean and that science had been there for years and years I'm not sure if they had that they've taken it down yet or not I I drive by their constantly but I don't really notice it 'cause it's just part of the woodwork for me\nI Hope they didn't because they think in a lot of ways this is something that wasn't just a place that was a factory that employed people to make macaroni\nIt was a lifestyle and it was a grouping of people that their livelihood depended upon it whether or not it became board and eventually which is\nHere you know there's something that creates this business that we realize that we can go into a supermarket wherever we are at sea print macaroni ... spaghetti ... fettuccine\nIt's something that is so important that we take for granted that at the turn of the twentieth century this ethnic foods which was really the the\nFood that people enjoy that a daily basis probably was something that was being introduced to people of all walks of life so it's\n... yeah I think it yeah well you mentioned about how um [noise]\nIt employed on not only Italians that people have many ethic backgrounds have it forwarded on the on the Portuguese neighborhood here in the law which is where my husband grew up in the flat it was in the name of it really was in a neighborhood where they called the sacred hot or the grove or there was another section which she bought it\nWhich had caught the bleach me because of the factories and roll\nAnd um it's funny that you say about this to get into um Monica on many of them as the older I'm entrenched people who grew up in shaker had area or which we call it the grove\nHated it when it was called to fail because they want it didn't want it to take over what they they knew their neighborhood can be at the grove\nBut many many Portuguese an Irish people I work at ... yes I mean and then their children grow up and worked there for years and years and it was just it was a shape of the city and call it ... it it really did\nIt crippled a lot of people and and a lot of people were out of work at that time\n... thank you so much for the call I Do want to meet Jean arrived park in before the news I say hello to Anthony gene\nOh hello Anthony how fat and I it's nice to talk to you [noise] how\nHigh there and I wanted to ask Anthony opinion on what I find someone hasn't met that's already but the fact that they're cancelling Columbus Day and so many towns and cities I'm due to the I don't want that replacing it with indigenous day but it just seemed like a slap in the face\nTo Italians and just Columbus Day I'm I'm\nAstonished myself I I basically look at Columbus Day or something but I've always known and I I of course have visited the purported grave of Columbus and I think sometimes in a lot of ways he's somebody that we've known for generations so to speak\nWhether or not he was the person who found the new world think he was on the way to the route to India or not\nI think in some ways it's something that's really quite peculiar and I've come to the conclusion and a lot of ways that when I hear the mayor's the specific cities it's actually to become an indigenous day\nI Begin to wonder is there something else if one could do such as the other Sunday in October the indigenous day\nBut there seems to be a sense and a lot of ways that we are changing our culture in some ways to accommodate others and to make them feel good or basically to include them so is the one that\nChanges I think if I forgetting this really attacking American day they're thinking of it strictly is oh Columbus was a long time ago they're not ... they're not realizing what it means to be a talent\nTo do we change the name of a school in Boston and I think sometimes why should we change the name of a holiday I think you're right it is a slap on the face and it is somewhat offensive because I think in some ways\nThis aspect of the sons of Italy is so imperative and many aspects because it's not only the protection of China you know the name but it's also the fact of tried to make people understand who was Columbus and what did he do\nI've heard these stories um the various radio programs [noise] oh he was financed by the king and queen of Spain and of course he was where else would have gotten the money to actually have a three ships\nYou know I think in a lot of ways that was taught when I was a child to the schools but I think we need today to actually look at this and realize each one of us contribute to our fabric of society\nGenes from Hyde Park and ride we get to and that's a great point if anybody else wants to take aim at that question feel free\nSix one Seventy five for ten thirty if you don't want to pay the toll its\n...

D. to mentor and I heard radio station\nIn some ways met at St Leonard's because the preponderance walls most of them lived at that time Boston I don't think it had anything to do per se with the Italian American community\nBut it was probably something that was a away aspect to St Francis so I'm not sure about it and it's\nI think in a lot of ways that might be something that I'll do a little bit of research so few do Facebook please send me your email and I'll do as much research was confined to get to that info\nThat would be wonderful I really appreciate that simply because as I said I never know much about it and listening to you and I thought well this is a time to us so I Will email you and messenger yell at ... ... email you\nSo how did she get it started I'll put it Facebook

happened\n... let me know because I think that's one of the fun things would we begin to realize I mean it's not just the fact of the sons of Italy and I've called St Leonard's but\nI think we have to realize in some ways the the fabric of life is connected in many different ways whether it's Roman Catholic or its charitable organizations that fundamentally is supported over the century it's an important feature to realize that touches upon all of our lives so thank you how\nIt might have said something to do it with her son my uncle because he had a specific problem at my grandmother was

today how you doing tonight hello ... yes we are well thank you\nOkay I'm Bradley if it's okay I did my actual thing why I write up the questions I leave it up to chance or whatever you want to answer OK\nI'm Rita questions and your cancer\nWhat I mean why ... what wait for in a row is a lot to remember like the first question that let's do one of\nThe though but that's the thing\nYou're ... or something just answer wine or two or\nWhatever I I Will do the best we can go ahead\n[noise] question why ... what are the top three things most county in\nQuestion kale dream last comment stakes keep on\nThree top three favorite most people do it\nAnd the question what three square they say\nThat's like a twelve questions\nAll right I'll take the ... three when we go to Italy which we usually do every fall but this year we couldn't go because of health reasons but we go to Italy I think one of the things is of course the eternal city is wrong I Love him and we said the same hotel which is a hotel for him\nIt's directly opposite the forum and um basically it's the most wonderful place and the restaurants are great\nBut I think one of the concepts is though I enjoy Venice and I enjoy Florence and I enjoyed Naples [noise]\nOne of the things we like to do is we rent a villa and send out of the camino which is about a hundred and twenty five miles southwest of a southeast of a room and we stay there at least a week and I always things sometimes visiting the countryside of Italy is the most wonderful thing\nSo granted urban cities are really lovely and things of that sort but I really liked to see the countryside how people really live how they live\nEat drink and of course enjoy and socialize with one another\nI think in some ways I'm very proud to be an Italian American I'm only Hof um I think in some ways I've looked at my family in some ways and I said\nWhat have we done to contribute back to you know the fabric of society in Boston and I think we've done a lot\nI've heard a lot of history books and they don't just touch upon my family's history but they touch upon everything of Boston's history from the period of sixty Verde to the president [noise] so when I think about the evolution of the city's history\nBegan to realize that I'm probably one of those folks and the wheel in one of thousands of people have a lot of ways that I have an ethnic religious or racial background but in some ways has now melted into what we call a Bostonian\nI think in some ways I'm very proud of being that but it's also the fact of what else can I Do to make it better so that each one of us feel as though we're part of that fabric of society\nAlright phase these films I don't know I really do but it's fun in some ways to think what ... what are we who are we we're if we come from that's when I'm always trying to do as a historian so I think sometimes the sons of Italy book it's a great example of that for ... what what it's done\nDo you consciously tried to keep the Italian in you alive keep the Italian this interview upfront\nI don't really necessarily think of myself as anything other than myself I mean it's only a fabric of who I Am um I also have white hair I also have a lot yeah yeah\nBut I think one of the don't merrily self identify about what I Try to do sometimes is to reconnect with things that were fond memories for the past and I think I mentioned earlier\nMy grandmother did make pasta one of your earlier callers that talked about doing the posture and he his grandmother put it on wax paper on the bed my grandmother put under the clean she\nBut the other thing was to my grandmother also made something that I sometimes make on occasion which meatballs\nEveryone knows what a meatball is but I don't think anybody really realize sometimes what they were and my grandmother may with raisins and ... yeah I don't do that and I knew they were ... beautiful but it was so odd when I was a child that I thought this is really peculiar\nBut I think sometimes October wasn't just Italian American ... it was also the fact that\nFour of us in the family all share the same boat for our birthdays and because my cousin Joe uh

country [noise]\nCuts rewrite federal yes you know that anybody\nHas any smart goes here with us to help celebrate talking about things are telling an American and I'm referring to his book the sons of Italy of which you're a member\nYes I think it a lot of ways when I realized that the grand lodge has so many familial lodges that it's a very important feature of the ... which I Belong to a very active and it's a fun group of people very lovely people that are a lot of ways\nYou know are still stolen the virtues of what it was when it was founded in Nineteen fourteen\nYou talked about one area of Italy the like and I bet you've got bend to others since we're talking about Italy and you might as well share that sort of a to another area of Italy\nWell I think one of the concepts is I mean we travel I rent a car and especially in Rome\nAnd in many ways I go to where we tend to go but then I loved to lose myself within the countryside\nAnd I think sometimes when my aspects is I Love the area in and around Naples apple you know send a NATO bell to communicate in front of the known\nThose are the areas in some ways that you begin to realize you can go to a small shop by bred by cheese a bottle of wine and simply sit on a hillside look out onto this country that has the most fascinating place but in some ways is\nSimilar but very dissimilar to Italian American culture a Boston you know Rome is a very sophisticated city but in the countryside in some ways\nI Try to understand what people are saying and blow by Italian is halting I think in many ways I've learned in some ways to look at not only how they live or they worship how they shop\nBut basically to go to the cafes and interact with people and it's a fascinating tool so to speak of the entire aspect so you've\nDefinitely been to a pump pay and Oh yes her ... that's right in your area and what about uh like ...\n... is absolute can you was grab that are the people well you know if you think of\nHillsides but these hillsides populated with houses to send to the ocean is just incredible ... of the most picturesque especially at sunset you begin to say in some ways what is Italy and what is Chiquita terror\nIt's suddenly going a lot of ways that arriving during the day is lovely it's a great aspect but then you begin to realize that the evening as lights begin to come on the ocean itself is simply lapping up the shoreline\nDinner and a drink is the most wonderful thing but I think if you know chink would tear my very favorite it's right off the coast of Italy is capri [noise]\nSo when we go to ... we always stay at ... ... which is the very top of prey\nSo in many instances they were not only hotels but small pet jailed has and will stay with them in the food is quite good but enjoying a drink as you overlook the ocean which you're up hundreds of feet overlooking the Atlantic\nOf the Mediterranean Sea it's something that's just magical\nWithout during be a ... an absolute martini straight up the queen of\n[laughter] like [laughter] vodka is pretty rare sometimes in Italy and I will usually either have I'm\nA very simple drink with Jim or even whiskey but I think a lot of ways I'm always astonished week we couldn't find Jamieson whiskey for our lives in Rome until I went to the capital G. Fiore one time I rented a villa\nIn Rome it was enormous don't ask me why did it but it was right on the Victoria ... well halfway between the capital Fiore and I thought it a lot of ways it was nice\nSo they said it was the second floor [noise] so I so great that's perfect so second floor was actually the third floor\nAnd it was nice units it had three bedrooms was huge living space overlook the area was ... but it had a hot water tank which was maybe ten gallons a year or so every time we did this we had to go up the stairs to press the button that it was ...\nBut I I thought it would be fun to cook and this unit and I went to the capital to fury daily to buy fresh pasta fresh vegetables that we buy different things and I thought to myself wow this is getting expensive and then I found two days before we left the supermarket that was up the street\nSays ... half the price and\nThe pastor that I spent something like seven euro's fall for one pound was one year\nThe fact that Pete and revere I pay your on WB the ones having to fight for ten thirty for anybody else to give us a shout I beat\nHer skinny then yes you're always very and former often that I I just had a crush of a car a statue\nYes a actually a comment on the question okay sure and a rhino why\nIs partly they're facing changed even when he's affiliated with the old notch a Christ Church behind them there is a reason for that I just wanted a fantasy who's very knowledgeable by the way if he heard about this\nAnd I think in some ways you look at that and you realize that doctor dean ... who's the president of outlawed dj attracted to these people who were the movers and shakers not only of their day but kind of been a lot of ways people that have contributed to the fabric of Boston\nSo when do you think about governors and mayors and other photographs that show people along not just with the pope but also Bernard ... caught the law\nThe book itself shows the gamut of people who either members of the sons of mentally or associated in some way with it because as we've said I'm In one of the earlier callers mentioned\nThat this was a major feature of what the law is represented liberty equality fraternity and it was something that during that period of the early twentieth century\nThey had a ... magazine and the magazines itself was published monthly and then the period of a Nineteen teens twenties thirties and forties\nHalf was an English and half was in the Taliban\nAnd they began to realize that the cover which always have the lie of the sons of Italy which represented the champion of the Italian Americans always ruin the presence of his sons of Italy not only had that magazine that was read by thousands of people on a monthly basis\nBut they even had the loyalty oath of the sons of Italy in America that was written by Angela ...\nAnd he was a member of the Winchester large I'm of the sons of Italy and it's something that actually was published during World War two and it's United we stand with the flag of the United states that was probably depicted ... all of the sheet music\nThe loyalty oath was an important feature\nBut the sons of Italy was something that really did incorporate a lot of ways not just to tally tally and Americans and associated friends\nBut it was something in some ways that made people feel a parts of the fabric of life\nOr their sons of Italy chapters or I should say lodges in the west they did an Italian as yet had west\nVery much so they're they're across the United states and in subways that something that you begin to realize that you know it's waned somewhat I mean just like other organizations that are fraternal lodges\nThere's that up and down but the idea is in some ways it's always maintained that aspect of contributions back to the greater society and in many ways when I read the sons of Italy um newsletter which we get on a monthly basis it's a wonderful newspaper\nI thought it was a staunch Bush did how much each of these individual lodges Jew so the newspaper goes into greater detail not only what scholarship funds especially in may and June with graduating high school or even college\nYou begin to realize that how important it was that education was something that made one it's some aspects\nThing can away that made you contribute back to whatever it was that you just send it from and then this way we're establishing a scholarship fund with the sons of Italy and hopefully it will actually benefit people in the future\nSo I think sometimes that is an important way to look at this organization I mean they would down to the nineteenth century that was the daughters of the American revolution the sons of the American revolution colonial war society\nThey all do things that a lot of ways that made certain groups of people who are members solve it\nCognizant of the fact of what they could do not only as a group to benefit themselves and then benefits the greater community but also to help assist everyone and I think that's what the sons of Italy is done it was the fraternal organization and in this way Italy\nIs the ... aspect of this month of course is a major feature of Italian Americans\nHave a few more minutes I just want to flesh out or when it's like in Italy both a little marching retire and Naples bay area where you kind of hang out you mentioned country you have to take a boat there do you take it from ... or or or Naples already taken\nFrom Naples I usually will drive down to Naples I leave the car at the hotel and we'll take the boat across it's about a forty minute ride absolutely wonderful of course you're going out to this\nYou know Ireland and who were bribed but it's a little honky tonk on the waterfront and the boats are all docked but then you take a the ... up to and I pray and had a ... is the most magical place on the face of the earth\nThe sun is beautiful the breeze your high on the air you see the panoramic views of the Mediterranean the food is incredible always usually seafood or fish\nBut in a lot of ways that was something that I really have enjoyed going back many times it's three as also off the coast\nBut I think it a lot of ways you realize that even in ancient times the ... was actually a destination but the wealthy from the rural area\nAnd it's something today that I realized what we bring back things that always seemed to have lemons Idaho islands and lemon cello lemon cello is wonderful\nBut the idea is limited and you know different things napkins is always ... said they absolutely gorgeous we sent back China from um ...\nAnd I think that is something that you begin to see that it's this whole aspect of society that a little bit slower than Boston of course I don't have to be at a place the meeting and I don't have to drive from here to there\nI can almost walk within the community and it's pleasant during the day of course all of Italy has tourism\nBut after five o'clock everything becomes ... and you begin to realize that people will have a drink before dinner and then dinner is usually two or three courses\nAnd then it's just the most wonderful aspect of course we're tourists but the whole aspect is that you begin to actually enjoy what it is about the Italian American culture\nCaters sixty seconds on on pay and how how it\nStruck you well pump pay was really one of the most wonderful things we waited a few times over the years\nBut a few years ago we took our niece and nephew for the twenty fifth wedding anniversary we arrived at palm pay and we got there and I was giving the history about palm pay ... pay was a community that was really self sufficient and a lot of ways but it was within eyesight of the soup is\nThat during the period of ... it was everything from the wealthy to the poor it had some of the best\nPlumbing and drainage beautiful ... does it had great architecture it was a wonderful\nAspect of community and see some of the buildings cleared away we're actually restaurants with uh places where bowls of food would be exactly like where you would go up ... it'd be like a food truck well not a food truck but a a place with an outer door window you can just walk up and buy this stuff\nBut they also have the boss and they'd have saw on us but they also have indoor court yet and it was something in a lot of ways that it's being excavated continually but I loved it because it's actually it was something that was almost preserved and volcanic stone in Seventy nine eight day\nWe were there at one time and of course I saw that don't really was the ... smoking but it was something that they have a wild dogs that actually rural area so it's quite fun\nWell listen we need to roll out of here thank you so much for coming by as you do each month to celebrate Italian American and talk a little bit about your book and about your trips to Italy and you're going back soon we are over the winter and same place same area\nSame hotel for 'em but we'll probably actually spend a little bit of time in southern Italy\nExcellent All right six one Seventy five or ten thirty I might after Anthony goes I'm loving talking

but it's not anywhere near as pleasant as an as pleasant and experience Venice\nIt's fairy tale but it's real\nIt's a it's tough to believe that some place can be that beautiful it almost hurts your heart\nIt's ... it's it's truly painfully beautiful it's so beautiful that it hurts you somehow I don't know if it's because it's it would be impossible to describe its beauty or because you have to leave it or because it's so beautiful compared to where you live there is a weird pang of\nSomething it's so beautiful\nAnd talked about arriving there and going through a place called ... and then off to drink with Terry original five toes situated about two minutes apart on train and walk and you can walk from one of the other the other to the other ... situated on the western coast\nOn clips

million dollars but it seems like a million many steps up up up up up and I got into\nI brought with me one of those sandwiches that I mentioned before straight up for gotcha therefore gotcha is round with holes in it\nAnd parmesan cheese and something else some meets\nUp up up up up and you're walking right along the edge of the the ocean there's quite a few could fall down if you wanted this weird place where there's a like a cat cave someone is there's a little a cul de sac\nOn the side of the road someone has made a cat home like they're they're it's roped off and there are multiple cat dwellings and they just live there and they they they come up and they feed him and they go away the cats lived there by themselves people stop and you're not supposed\nTo feed them but they do of course it's kind of it's creepy tell you the truth or not so then you go down the steps down down down down down\n\nAs you enter the job you you can't help noticed wow this is ... this is not only on the water it's kind of in the water it's not a peninsula that might be a hundred yards long\nAnd the sea is smashing against the rocks on his peninsula one sided with the rocks the rocks protect the buildings there is\nA little walkway kind of a cave have been dug out by these smashing waves over the millennia you could walk right from the main street through this little ... and then all of a sudden you're on where the ocean is smashing against these rocks and that was off the side\nI wanted to get some nice video of the waves and the ... the the wave smash against\nIraq [noise] sprayed

that tumbled into the sea there were two towns I was I'm sure of how to pronounce where I looked up how to pronounce I wanted to be able to pronounce them before I told you about them\nBecause I forgot ... Noah is one\nMost of the photographs you see will be a Maryland all this arena the really really super colorful houses all of them have Calif allows tumbling down to the sea no beach in Maryland Noah people's Sundays on the rocks there's always some guy going to be mending is fishing and that's just the real deal\nAnd then there's real Missouri\nIt's southern most town kind of looks like melanoma is got nightlife not my thing nightlife outdoor DJ knights no thank you ... ... ... all night long no thanks\nGood rocky beach again a\nWalk appeal forty five minutes brings you to a church ... which I'm guessing means sanctuary and it's a church with panoramic vista you can look all the way back to the town of mom thorough so\nFar towns away so there you go now I made my way back to\nVenice\nIt's not a very interesting right to tell you the truth oh I'll be I'll be honest I'm spoiled you know you've been to Venice you've been to this town but you get to Venice and um it's shocking it's shocking and its beauty it's sucking it's so real again it's hard to believe some where that beautiful actually can\nReally exist and people can make a living there and live there and be born and\nWork go to school and high it's\nAlmost too pretty to be a real town\nA lot of walking like not a lot of cars 'cause I Can't be lots of cobble stones\nIn a good sensible shoes is very much a very much\nIt feels like the ocean the oceans all around canal some of them the grandkid a very wide and it and send you a Jew with the with the ocean it's a connection\nThere are many canals and it's pretty special when you're walking down the cobblestone street then go up this little arched stairway wasn't nice railing\nOver a canal which is an actual highway with people it's not just people who are tourists there is business getting down there but there are many tourists and those kinds of laws and I didn't do that but I probably should've I'm leery of that kind of thing but I probably should have\nIt gives me a reason to go back\nSo there are these\nCobblestone streets Warren's of\nCobblestone streets everywhere you go you peek into a restaurant oh my God this is the most beautiful restaurant or oh my God\nAnd it's not just you're not just say that because you're there it really is and it may be a tourist restaurant but it's still good\nYou can pay a lot of you want but you can you can get a nice plate of macaroni and gravy and a nice house wine that's what I Do all the time\nAnd I'm just feeling all pumped and ecstatic about how have you genuine it all seems then you go to\nSt Mark's square St Mark's\nFever will\nChurch whatever you call it on a previous trip I was their new uh Christmas Eve or the ... or the day before Christmas\nAnd the choir was practicing so it was open and a few people were in there I guess there are many people out at night in the winter and ... why don't you could go in and watch this choir practice\nThat was quite something again I'm really lonely and the more beautiful stuff is the more painful loneliness gets\nYou want to share it got to admit ill\nA\nFacebook Live and Facebook sharing this stuff it really does keep you from being all that lonely because our loneliness as being unable to share and as much as I hate to admit it in able to share on social media is kind of like having a friend it really is\nSo St Mark's square is massive\nDue to climate change it's under water like a third of the time and so they've had to uh builds up walkways it stay there most of the time\n\nIt's pretty it's pretty empty it just really something to be wandering around there on a chilling that good something better about the children I it makes me feel like it\nOf course if you it doesn't feel like you are one of many\nAnd like tourists here there and it's chilly yoga nice it's not that bad and you have a jacket on your your cozy but when you're there in the in the chilly weather it's all yours it's yours\nNot you don't have to share with all these people\nIn some ways I understand that that's weird and selfish but in some ways it's total isn't you know and it's totally true you may not like the fact you like it better because it's all yours\nBut you do\nSo the hotel I have time for the hotel I didn't know exactly where the hotel was I kept asking for the name of this hotel yeah over there are no over there and no down there that we no no no\nMe forever to get there I thought it might be in a horrible neighborhood I didn't know\nThat all of a sudden I Am getting closer and I see I'm In I'm In a shopping district and I was seeing stores like Chanel\nAnd ...

sort of all of a [noise] a friend that you're one I I understand you want to go to Sicily yes I Do that\nThat's due to fall in the wintertime it can go on top of the tallest mountain in Europe that no [noise]\nSkiing and you can do all the way to the top you get a ticket or once you get up to the top of the ... you get off what a bus or whatever you call would pick the food or the cable car only halfway up the top [noise]\nAnd then after that they have this [noise] I watch this I mean that that uh they drive up the on the top of the lava and there you go further up and they want to go to the top\n[noise] uh sometimes have a guy with the case that you can go up to ... and as you drive up to the mound that are on the road from a nickel or see all the way up to a mountain on the road juicy\nIt's a couple of houses have been there were buried years ago by the law but what about\nThe run up to and it's something to see a beautiful and and uh all the little town at the time [noise] people from the city\nShrunk down there they drive up their their their their ... buses that they go up the skiing for\nIn the morning up until about two or three o'clock and then all those buses you see them coming out and they stop on the little towns they stop at the bottom of the cafe and eating their start drinking they start dancing or something\nI I live here I was born there and uh I Know what it is a left the country when I was Fifteen\nWho knows how to throw a spectacular party\nOh my God I went to a party and its house in the summer so great is that with those are ... cocktails I told you about\nKing crab legs is the big ones right I'm guessing we've named king you know\nBoxes of king crab legs there was no wondering if you could have another one that there was an embarrassment of pink trembling king crab legs just it's so cool that somebody so generous that they supply so many\nCrab legs you just got our our our our eating crab legs\nSteak steak truly did melt in your mouth to be cliche\nAnd oh fried clams trays of fried clams big trays of fried clams you could just be within a you know they just pick them up and handfuls and smash them in their mouth it was it was fantastic\nI Would think since he's and he's very very big expert on Italian cooking you know it maybe you'd want to go to one of these cooking to us\nBut it's it's a bird person devil occupancy I wouldn't want my own room because I Know I was ...\nI don't want to be keeping people up yeah I Do is you know I kind of think everyone's notice though because have you ever been\nCamping where there are multiple bunk beds the Appalachian\nTrail the the AMC hats sometimes you'll have six people sitting in one of those\nYou'll have girls guys that they're you know unisex anybody can sneak to young people oh people everyone's Norse if you lie awake on one of those nights in one of those huts with six eight people\nLittle Miss high school girls snoring away cotton wood yoga guys cutting wood ...\nYoung women they do snow with a higher pitch it was not the same they're not sounding like giant [noise] but no snoring\nEverybody knows they don't like to admit it though I don't

Italian because we're going to the north end Boston's north end a national treasure and as Bob in the north and Bob\nYou're on a rally hey I Would be remiss if I didn't call you call that I think your caller and shouting and that so what would it be if you're calling from the LA Times that's right [laughter] what did you land in the journal of the travel talk I Love you know everybody loves you travel talk you know a great job describing things very descriptive\nAnd a couple of other people did you the the woman who from Boston she runs a business over there\nI hear that I even went and checked up website so interested in that I mean I haven't been over there since I was a teenager but they got me thinking about going back you know all the talk you know just you know visual in my mind you know I didn't appreciate it when I was younger I went with my grandfather actually wants to Sicily and I didn't appreciate it when I was younger and you know maybe it's time for me to go visit\nThat cooking vacations swims down really good I don't know how much it is is\nThat it's a great look inside I just I just checked real quick what I was listening to try to a lot of good multi task is a kind of focusing on the radio and I was just checking it out but I'll go back to tomorrow we'll check it out a little more [noise]\nSee what I mentioned to you you didn't appreciate when you're a kid where would you go back to [noise]\nUm well I mean the trickle Terry area describing sounds really nice or a you know you're gonna be a lot of good created a lot of friends of mine you know the market coast that area\nYou know that's that's that's that's probably as places where I Would go you know\nYeah yeah like I said I was a kid I Know what was it was there was an ... dumped especially what'd you want to visit relatives are stopped it was a little village type town and like you said there wasn't really much to do it wasn't you know when you're young kid you just want to go home you know so you don't appreciate the beauty of things [laughter] like that when you're younger so I just wanted to go home [laughter] we just got to get my grandfather was dragged along\nWell now with the mother country\nSo you recommended that restaurant last say last ... last year you liked it I liked it allegedly\nThe oh good I'm Glad you liked it and how did you ever get to talk to lean on the honor their no very nice lady\nAnd only been one time I got to go back but a previous maybe general homeland you Frank talked about rice balls is that a thing you know yeah yeah\nOh yeah oh yeah I didn't see any it's called which means that the orange and Italian I didn't even to orange yeah I mean Cheney's oranges plural\nSo that's it 'cause it looks like an orange if you look at it like they put the word comes around it as an orange look towards what looks like an orange but it's basically a rice ball in a yeah you mentioned a bird does which is yeah one of the best ones you can get in Boston um you know I'm biased I mean that's my favorite place was happy that they mentioned that 'cause she has a pretty accurate for the best starting changing yet\nSo there's rice ball but what's in is this something inside the rise\nYeah well the one that they have they're the ones with the little beef hamburgers beef in a piece for like a little bit of sauce and uh yeah they have other ones will like spinach and cheese but this one has like cheese and a meat in a row and peace inside\nIt's very good very good in the price of very long Broncos is like we're we're a little a little holes in a while I don't know if you've been there like you said it's right across from Mike's but for only open until like about maybe two or three o'clock in the afternoon really broke leisurely yeah drove they open up about you know ten thirty eleven actually the\nWho runs the place you're going in the early in the morning like if I go on for a walk in and they're like five six o'clock in the long ago and then getting everything ready and you know it's everything ready and then he opens up you know when the\nTen thirty eleven like I said usually aligned goes up so you got to have to get there real early of the weather is really nice aligned goes up so quick and it's by the line was the law was along the lines of scare you just wait in line is probably will to learn about Fifteen minutes if there's a long line open door usually yeah wow\nThat that's one of the the price of the right you know you can get beer and wine there and it's a very reason I like I said it would be the the local people that have been her wildly keeps things reason was a lot like close to you know leaders like local grocery this case the prices reasonable about some of the bishops to come in and like on the street can be a big tourist state because they know they got\nBigger and to me so the prices can be a little out of whack you know\nBut uh yeah the point where last he has a very reasonable number of those is very nice you know they make us a pizza there would you like the square pizza\nYeah it's a it's a piece of they're considered there too and also if you're a reasonable\nHave you ever experimented with meat balls putting and we're like tonight we heard about me bows did including raisins and paying your only nuts\nYeah I'm just I Would have to buy on Carson's my grandfather my grandfather had the best me all the men were all the cooking challenge\nYeah my grandfather me there are so it was also quite was almost like a hamburger number like a ball and he fired them you know an olive oil and the answer and it was very well done was a little crispy on the outside my grandfather had the best meatballs a stranger is probably the closest place the tastes like my grandfather's if you're on the straight and I make a good me Paul there\nHave you been to all the restaurants there probably have right\nJust about yeah I've been to just about all of them yeah I always wanted to show when you start getting into the the other dog was it\nToday I was saying you should really I always try to you don't really have a lot of commercial insurance it

V. the buses WXXI ... two men and I heard reviews the\nIt's famous because he organized a series of tribes on\nThe Arabian Peninsula drove into a north up into Syria and and captured Damascus um but then with essentially betrayed\nBy his own government and by the French who passed an agreement to divvy up what his today Syria Lebanon the Israel Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia\nThe people that he worked with a where he's sort of organize these tribes on the Arabian Peninsula they ended up losing even though they won\nA in ... at the time are moving into Damascus but when they lost they lost to the the family that was the house of Saud and so Saudi Arabia is founded in the Nineteen thirties Nineteen thirty two I think\nAnd we have had a relationship with them it was ever shortly after um because essentially what happens is that\nA Saudi Arabia captures the two most holy places in Islam mecca and Dina\nI'm and that the Saudis represents\nA branch of Islam called Sunni Islam which is the largest branch and it is opposed by the other side of Islam called Shia Islam which is in Iran and so we had this curious situation where\nThe U.S has actually supporting Iran I'm In the Nineteen fifties and we actually toppled the Iranian government put in place our own guy\nA and then we stationed troops in Iran and we set up an oil company to help pump oil out of Iran or for decades until the Iranian Revolution in Seventy nine kicks out and we suddenly become a enemies to Iran and Saudi Arabia becomes one of our closest allies\nAre and then of course they have the largest production of oil in the world actually actually that's not true of the United states produces more oil today than Saudi Arabia does that sort of a a fluke\nAnd most important thing is that Saudi Arabia can produce it much cheaper than anybody else\nSo the United states produces oil um it's about twenty five dollars a barrel on average\nAnd the kingdom of Saudi Arabia can produce of about ten dollars a barrel so they can\nAfford to flood the market with a lot of their oil and then drive the price down to arrange that puts other country's oil under pressure and and they start losing money or when they produce but Saudi Arabia continues to gain money so that sort of like the the big\nThread that ties to the right first and foremost it's Saudi Arabia controlling the price of oil in the world markets secondly it's now that Saudi Arabia is the strategic enemy of our strategic enemy which has Iran um right now and that\nSaudi Arabia holds down the two most holy places in Islam and the U.S has a big a big sway in places like Syria and um Iraq where there's other there's complicated um ethnic and religious issues there that are driving those conflicts\nSo what do we get out of the relationship and what do they get out of [laughter]\nSo uh we get oil but more than that and actually we don't really use their ... what other people get away with what we get is stability so we use Saudi oil to stabilize prices in the world um and we use Saudi Arabia to stabilize the region\nUm with their money and with the oil prices that they can sort of set so they can help us or hurt us in places like Iraq or Syria or Iran why and\nGo ahead and a lot of weapons from us so we are providing them with billions of dollars worth of weapons system in the news recently um our weapons are being used to prosecute a war in Yemen right now Yemenis an ally with Iran so that's what's going on\nSo how much of what we get from Saudi Arabia could we get from Iran ... what would happen if we were more friendly to run an Iranian seemed to be at their core much more like we are and just waiting for a chance like inside of\nAn every Iranian is an American trying to get out\nI think that's true um I have a I have an uncle who comes from Iran spin and friends from there also um and I can I can see very much what you're saying\nThe ... in terms of oil we could get you know Iran can't produce like Saudi Arabia can but it can have a major impact but the the basic differences is that she Islam is a much smaller\nA population of of Muslims Sunni Islam and uh and in the end\nAnd machine are controlled by Saudi Arabia so we can't get that with Iran\nAll right we do we lose moral authority continuing to deal with the Saudis or ... and I guess the question I asked ... do we have any at this point\nDo we have any moral authority here is that oh God [laughter]\nOh boy\nI'm I think we've done a lot of harm to it and the situation with the Saudi journalist a\n... is um is a\nHeartbreaking I'm you know we're all but certain uh people even like Lindsey Graham the Republican side has said you know we believe that he was murdered\nIn the Saudi constantly it's by Saudi officials under the orders of MS beam hamlet NBS Mohammed bin Salman the the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nAnd even Lindsey Graham is talking about imposing sanctions so\nI think if we don't do something I think you have you know a few more days if if as a secretary Pompeo says you need to give that the Saudis some time to sort of come up with a new story um that's fair but I think after a few more days and you're going to see a lot of push to do something especially after the midterm election\nAny chance that it was a the conservative ... that did it to embarrass a in our family was not being conservative enough\n[noise] I don't really know enough about that level of detail to to speculate on it um what we do know is that ... was was highly critical of NBS uh basically said that he was not a reformer that he made himself out to be\nA and we know at this point that more than a handful of the Fifteen or so people who are believed to be involved with a with the alleged murder are linked to a M. S. N. B. S. in the security services okay so the question now really is\nCan Mohammed bin Salman survived the scandal as the heir apparent or a does he loses chance at the throne\nInteresting so are all in the ... and cries and follow coming from the U.S just hot air because we'll never do anything that we really will not imposed sanctions on someone that is so where so deeply involved with correct\n[noise] I don't know I mean it's always surprising when Lindsey Graham is is arguing for something like this or any other question is\nYou know you don't have imposed on tomorrow you could wait until after the elections and and see what happens in the house and the Senate um and and\nImpose them after the new Congress seated in January um so so Congress could legislate sanctions um enforce them on the president like they did with the Russian sanctions a couple of years ago\nOkay back to the moral authority doesn't really matter moral authority to just feel good does it doesn't really have anything to do with our power and our influence\nI absolutely believe that it does our our core interest\nIs in having as many democracies in the world as possible um and we're we're different that way because democracy itself as a moral interest rate we don't believe that all governments are equal regardless of what kind of regime type they have we believe that um democratic representation is\nThe only a moral way to govern the country\nAnd so even with a place like like Saudi Arabia we work with these countries but our our long term rhetoric has always been that we do this with the hopes that in time\nThey will begin to liberalize and democratize their systems and so I think that's a it's an absolutely core American value it helps explain how we behave um in terms of foreign policy and uh and when we were not consistent with how we follow it\nUm but in a case like this where it seems like the violation is just a astounding only\nA bald faced a I think it's quite problematic if we don't do something to stand up for those\nWho seems like our moral authority has been eroded it seems to be what you say how do they get eroded water some recent events or what is the reason events that haven't voted it\n\nTo Russia um when the Soviet Union fell he ended up as a deputy mayor in St Petersburg and then ah many people believe began a series of um\nCorrupt deals that started together money for him and and money from a local area communist parties that needed to get their money abroad and hide it as a as a Soviet Union was collapsing and they were afraid that they would lose the Communist Party would be outlawed and they would lose that money\nAnd putting a German language skills and his experience or in the west put him in a position to launder a lot of money or at least I have to buy a lot of people that I trust on this and he started to make this money and then was um\nWas moved up the chain by Boris Yeltsin who was the president at first president of Russia the nineties he became head of the KGB and then you also in a advocated the presidency and handed it to ...\nYou know that's a good spot to have to actually break and I'd like to talk a little more after this bubble laundering parts W.

and potent and the relationship with the United states you gave a brief history of Newton's rise in Soviet Union and Russia and included a mention of a communist money and\n... was really good at gathering that up as a a communist comic communism fell Soviet Union fell apart heavier laundered I saw active measures this documentary that\nSpent substantial time showing that Trump Tower was a haven for such money laundering how true is that\nA very true um let me let me talk for a second but some of my other work that was um\nLast in the hill a newspaper right after the election about December [noise] um I published a T sort of catching uh some things out that I I I cannot fully proved budget but the\nThesis goes something like this [noise] um\nThere was the largest money laundering case in us history was about seven and a half billion dollars and it was prosecuted in New York and it was essentially all Russian money a billion dollars is believed to bend laundered through the U.S by the Georgian character that was in Egypt the view from its chew in Trump\nTower meeting just to to draw that connection then right\nUm the most of this went through a bank called the republic bank of New York um there there there's all sorts of scandal around that the death of the um the the the man who ran the bank to preserve that bank back in Nineteen Ninety eight I'm\nSo all of this stuff is swirling ad in the nineties the Russians basically are moving billions and billions of dollars\nUm hundreds of billions of dollars out of the country and trying to trying to clean it and parking and safe places\nAnd there's basically two ways that you do this if you want to move a lot of money that's relatively clean\nAnd and whitewash it said that you can invest it elsewhere you do real estate [noise] and if you have really dirty money for things like drugs and prostitution you use casinos [noise] because you're going to lose eighty percent of it\nIs in Washington but the casinos for all the pay off and everything else and you lose comparatively less in real estate you can you move forward or something that's essentially what has happened with the apartments in the Trump towers or the infamous a deal with the ah with the residents in I'm In Florida\nThat this money is being laundered a in these the the real estate and casino deals\nThat much of this what's happening in the Nineteen nineties\nDutch bank who was Donald Trump's major a lender after all the other banks stop lending to him because it was bankruptcies in the nineties which then paid off the largest the largest settlements just a few years ago here was the bank that helped\nMove all of this money and it was he was a sense of the largest chunk of it was Russian money coming through torture by going to um you know other places in the U.S almost certainly including\nThe Trump Organization although we don't have proof of that is your contention that are\nBoth Trump Tower condominiums and the casinos that Trump was involved in both those levels of laundry\n[noise] my guess is is that the Trump is not the details man [noise]\nUh and and so he doesn't understand or know about\nThe legal niceties that allow this to happen and where things are being shaded where where laws are being sought out broken that that is mostly in the realm of his um his financial group whose name I'm missing right now who was\nIndicted by a law or just a few weeks ago\nOkay so I don't know if I committed a crime just saying I I'm not a details man doesn't really economy and how how is it possible that\nSomebody can launder that much money and not get caught and how is it possible that some\nAnd did that could become president how's this possible of someone who did that said president I don't get it [laughter]\nWell the first the first problem is is that uh\nWe're laundering money implies that you can prove that the money was illegally gained\nIn the first place and when you're looking at Russia especially in the Nineteen nineties you don't even know what laws are in a factory is or the Soviet lost all of the fact that they were new laws who's following what\nAnd so so proving that this is corrupt money even though everyone knows that it is um is is very different thing in a legal sense of what was what was your second question so we can we prove that this happened\nYou know legally that's that's harder than uh than I think people realize the second question is\nHow do how do you come in with that yeah he's in case and how do you stay president and I guess the first answer answer the second to question the second two questions yeah yeah do you prove it you don't you can't prove it but I Would think you really could prove it in the ... the documentary active measures\nThey say that condominiums are being bought and sold without even any identification right is that that's how it works right and gun crime isn't that kind of crime me\nIt is kind of crime you but then you have the problem of of liars loans which but good chunk of Americans signed on you know before two thousand eight also which is essentially the same kind of thing and I had a you know we've had a misdemeanor a felony crime\n[noise] and so there's all sorts of ways that you can you can skirt these things I I think something something Crimea happened uh but whether or not you can you can prove this to a level of of your satisfaction is a different story but that's why you know the bowler investigation isn't\nIt is gathering a lot of this data and I think that there's sort of there's three\nThree big pillar to it right one is is whether or not there was collusion um on on interfering in the campaign right now the second one is whether or not there was obstruction of justice against similar investigation about interfering with the campaign\nBut if he actually tried to do something it would hurt him worse um but there's a political benefit again in in doing it this way right in in building a sub deploying the sub moving in about provocatively around Internet cables and forcing us to reactivate the you know the Atlantic fleet and things like that [noise] um so that's it's it's the old game field Soviet game\nOkay president says what's the what's so terrible about being pals with Russia and what is so terrible about it [laughter]\nUh Russia does not have any of our interests are doesn't doesn't share our interests and and pretty much in any way a pollutant is a is an absolute author Terry and leader he does terrible thing it's like assassinate a journalist or he essentially has a a gulag system again in the in Siberia and the prisons\nThat why Trump likes him because he fascinates journalists I'm Serious and because of the ... system\nYou know so here's the thing I think Trump is squeamish [laughter] I don't think Trump likes to hear things about the details of of you know a ... murder he ... he doesn't do well with that\nUm he doesn't like the real politic of of having to order people to kill 'em or or have people die on his watches as commander cheap so I think he really hates that stuff but\nShe thinks that he has to like it in sort of a TV movie way okay\nAnd and that's why he likes Trump's he likes that sense of resolve that way like ...\nBecause ... is kind of a movie character yeah All right and I talked about the transatlantic cables and okay we're just um can you comment on\nI guess this is political what kind of political\nDamage or\nEven or help is it when the president talks about love letters to Korea now he fell in love with him all that was ... you know how bad is that or maybe not bad at all\n[noise] I think that that these things have a a deleterious effect but that they're slow moving I think that the real effect that the Trump Administration and these kinds of ah these\nKinds of things like the letters or the sucking up to ... that awful press conference or when he was visiting with food and in Helsinki that that these things are really going to hurt us a decade from now\nBecause what this administration has done\nIs shown the rest of the world that they can't trust the political or moral civility the United states and that they have to now start to\nAdjust their policies to assume that someone like a Trump could come to power again and not back them up in the Baltics or not back them up um ... you know Israel or something like that\nAnd and so it's when everybody else starts moving and doing other things like deciding what we have to you know rearm ourselves um or change our trade agreements in order to prevent the in order to protect against the possibility that the United states is going to violate the norms that it's been following for decades that's when you see the world order start to start to shatter\nSuddenly starting now but I I think it's really bad and twenty thirty\nIs Trumbull one and done style leader or I mean would there be another person like him or are we learning lessons\nAnd to know like I I think that Trump has changed the politics in the U.S and I think\nI'm from here on out you're going to have a character like Trump in our electoral system you're going to have a presidential character that sort of plays that role both on the left and the right that has to be um a larger than life show many kind of character um in order to get elected\nAnd I heard that's a good thing just for giggles can you see anybody\nOn the left that would be that kind of person other than Alec Baldwin\n[laughter] I Can't right now I mean that's the question on the left writers who who's gonna run in twenty twenty I don't see that but I Would but he would be the type and and I and I do think that there's a serious possibility that you have someone coming out of the entertainment world I'm picking up the mantle and trying to run in twenty twenty\nNow Steve Bannon was afraid of Oprah\nDid you have you read that he was series yeah thinking that Oprah she ran for takedown\nTrump\nOh I think that's a real possibility um yeah there's no questions he has more power than Trump does um and she's a serious person right so ... and likable right so she she would be a great candidate in in any number of ways\nBecause you don't have to know how to do everything how do you need to do is find people who knew know how to do everything\nYeah okay she'll she'll put people around her um that are competing yeah how much of a deal is that if Mattis goes [noise] who isn't he replaces him and he was a\n... he was supposed to be the adult in the room and he kind of was a and the president didn't like having a and a dog in the room so\nThat was that a crucial thing madam gets fired\nDepends on who replaces him but yes it would be deeply concerning I I don't think that uh you know mad as a is enjoying the job I think he feels that it's a sense of duty I think it's the same way with John Kelly it was to the the same way with HR McMaster who was asked to revise or for a while that these people sort of stepped up\nAnd to play the role sort of stabilized or public um so I think it's a big deal if he goes\nI really do but I think he's going to try to fight it because he thinks it's a duty to say right he's one of the group of people that\nStay to protect\nThe American people from the president's worst impulses\nYou are right which is what he is accused of saying hey\nNow China we didn't even talking about China so you know you know the moment to talk about China we only have a very short time\nBecause you're such an excellent guess ... or is this the sunset of the United states as the dominant power\n[noise] that is a great question in the field of foreign policy or it might be but it's slow and there's always second and third chances to win a lot of ways\nYet the answer is yes ah that that the rise of China is is basically unstoppable unless she decided to wage major war which we would lose I'm\nUh in the sense that it would cost us more than it would cost them up words just fall apart relation there's like this\nBut China has a long way to go and and the the problem that China faces is is that they're going to ah [noise] they're gonna as the saying goes uh get great before they get rich and so the purchasing power of the average Chinese is still well below the average American um but given that there is you know four hundred million\nOr you know middle class Chinese even if it is well below the average American that equals a a very large economy [noise] um [noise] the problem is is that because the one child policy and

is a\nRoster hard freeze and some outlying areas\nFriday I mean it's on a breezy my other in the afternoon high fifty nine Saturday mostly cloudy with a couple of showers high sixty\nAnd all this cold weather means it's going to get slippery again and many people fall down and break themselves in this on ice black guys might walk to work I have a long walk very slippery I'm going to get some ... some traction devices are my feet I suggest you do the same\nWe're speaking with you and Valentine author of the deadly deep the definitive history of submarine warfare before we continue\nI have a question about a place and they visited it's all about submarines and I bet you know about it and maybe you can add something to my experience I went to Sonia and a half an hour away from talent is how does she\nDoes that ring a bell with you in the town that was taken over and made into a nuclear submarine center training center\nAnd a submarine guy you'd probably knows about that right\n\nAh I Do try to extend it for the a bill to flee and to I've been to Latvia next door but I'm afraid that didn't make it a ... and and to the Russians oversee during the Cold War how much it's sobering ... so it doesn't surprise me\nThat you are you found some interesting where you know if I say maybe ... to ... because well oh yeah oh\nIs that still in operation yeah ...\nYeah yeah that's the ... um yeah yeah that's the ... that was the um headquarters of the what used to be called the red vinyl and flee inside ... now\nI'm just an old and ... and I bought an anti submarine bullshit code I chose London and uh we went down the ... the Russian Navy as it was rough thing and a fan inactive is now more active and there's a lot more Russian so brings out of that today than it happen for a long time\nAnd interesting place\nAnd how was it that they allow you to go there because well it must be kind of secret\nYeah yeah it was a newspaper journalist and\nAre in those days are access and ... at the end of the Cold War was and\nI have ... today sending but the real navy and to so I was invited to cover this historic visit it would take is running for um new way to ... to to make the Russians say and set up by the end of the Cold War\nAnd it was at the time they called the hard liners who you know Nineteen Ninety One but they tried to\nType Russia back to Soviet days and we were shot at by Russian submarine or we met Russian warships crofton we wouldn't quite sure what was going to happen\nBut it turned out they were friendly and then we had an exercise of to visiting moment and square that Russia is already fought a practice to pay a little ship obviously they chose London unfortunately I twisted and it was I Would too if I eat they practice to pay do we could've still\n... whole so it was out to visit\nSo how did they invaded what ... what did they do to evade it\nAs well basically what happened was that during the ... with the Russians the enemy realized that they said on\nThis practice to pay that would actually be five I'm at ... so there was a well they called a rule fleets folks that are retiring to a ... with a choice to London and to an end up being a ... and they were both information and suddenly they sold it's um [noise]\nThis red or orange now you're just a practice to pay that which was near the surface of the city because that's how it's being guided by why between about why is it being why guided by some Russian so man\nIs an end to somebody in that we we couldn't see but knew was there on the side you know so they said they already saying starts coming towards\nThe um the British a formation playing or the school vessels in the rain I went to the ... will go to ... and so the the older and they forget it but it's like if I say of action so physically avoided it\nAnd I guess the Russians or both as sobering and somebody was getting\nReady to hate for any I'm putting the uh the Cold War back ... or an amusing incident you might say the time because she mentioned the Russian so man I think you get lost you know I've got one of these ... sites or fortunately the whole coast\nI'm surprised that those those vessels could avoid a wire guided torpedo\n[laughter] yeah well it was probably set noted its maximum speed and\nThen we have to think that the Russians although they were trying to scare was ... plus we actually trying to hit us but it was a practice Topeka that's somewhat different from a an actual tornado in that it doesn't have\nA a warhead and you know blow you up and I think is designed to let you see what they called the track as it comes to would chew so and so I think there was a a fairly good chance of avoiding it was to something that was a surprising to the British you didn't know that that was that she got into hadn't\nDid you actually see it in the water coming at you\nOr I think we saw it flashed by that's where you could say I mean these things happened so quickly in some ways you know even in a way it's happening until there's a sudden ... move and you say somebody what the heck's going on and then you say this kind of already just thing flashing by and that say you ... seconds that's all it takes\nSo we really didn't talk about World War one yet I'm I guess I don't need to talk about that conflict can you can you tell me the difference between you and a submarine is there a difference in what is the difference\nThey all the time I mean ... is the gym for an just say oh okay so ... yeah so I mean you buy 'em in in the boat you know I'm going to talk about you but then I'm just meaning German submarine okay uh it ... the ... really the access so I moved to\nUnload all one have you but it's\nLike you boats had more of a decade to me both like that\nRock of ages anniversaries way

huge we listened to talking and we have a lot to discuss these the news radio ten thirty the bulk of the deadly deep the definitive history of submarine\nWarfare it is very detailed book and we have offered in a ballot die with is thanks for being here\nIt's okay it's good can you give me an idea\nOf how many subs are out there was a nuclear powered subs Gary nuclear warheads how many out there\n\nThat's a very interesting question I mean if you're on a daily basis and I'll just for ... to a calculation in my head and they saw that it'd be very rough or if you ... you said and you can also brings with that\nYes yeah okay let me think um\nSo I Would say you know somebody who's maybe seven eight hope it doesn't say but I Would say there'll be others preparing to go uh met any one time and you're talking about America at usa ah UK France and\nRussia China now and and India is preparing to the old sites who sent to see and you can also brings ... is still very\nExclusive club that runs those massive base um trident fool you can you say a bullet those missiles to try and define it so I'm\nGonna run out and so I Would say a\nVery many at all I Want to be that's one of the country right\nWell yeah I mean ... ... each country will have I mean I'm not\nPrivy to the secret plans of other navies but for example the ah the royal navy has won out there all the time and I'm sure the U.S navy\nHas one or two at the end and one in the Pacific maybe area and one somewhere out there in Atlanta who knows a at any one time maybe more so and then the French have won a sale time\nAnd the Chinese ticket getting one sailed time the Russians one maybe two so I'm depends on what survivable\nUm other ... at some stage is funny and very difficult to do the Chinese for many years didn't really have\nA nuclear submarine seeing the Indians are just starting but any one of those submarines\nCarries a enough explosive path to I Would say and that will really so you don't need a lot of them to do a terrible damage and you hope that I never comes and that's the whole point of a\nNuclear deterrent submarines is to make sure that nobody ever attacks anybody in a major white conventionally and I'll take that that you have to use one is to tell you that it's only two gloomy here but at the end of the story so they they're pretty powerful\nMachine say the most powerful a weapons or that you never want to use the ... invented\n... do you have an idea of how many missiles on rock I tried it and what kind of a nuclear power dry or\nYeah or I suppose you pass it on ... on that but you know fix all pulled the rule navy now probably carries twelve\nA trauma missile submarines to us now you could carry more than that in the ... close but it's it was so submarines and the Russians similar so you're talking about somebody took in any way between twelve sixteen or even up to twenty four ah depending on on the boats\nA and M. H. one of those will have a a multiple a warhead\nTape with just one em explosive will head on the top but I actually saw the casing and once it gets hard enough and his trajectory or above the ... and it will ... and all these multiple maneuver ... heads will come out\nAnd we can't do any anti missile or sorry antibodies to muscle cells that the enemy has\nAn ... so you're talking multiple warheads on each missile so that's why you don't need many of these\nVessels at sea touchy goals\nThe destruction so I was just a multiple you know getting\nInto our heads on 'em or are they do they have a different target are the same token\nI think we'll be talking to you know they're very sophisticated and to\nGet into it and it these days you know you could well be sitting in a city now\nSo I could buy those on the list of let's say the Russian\nBut it's the missiles ... right now there was a time\nOff to the Cold War when it's the talk it and so they didn't have specific targets that was certainly the case for the royal navy in my country and I'm not so sure that would be the case but you'd have to ...\n... ... ... in about a minute yeah in about a minute is there is their doomsday program such that say\nRussia is totally destroyed and unable to wage any sort of war\nThat automatically down there that that is that a nuclear submarine is set up to shoot off islands missiles in the event that the host country has destroyed as doomsday safety device\nYeah you can do just try and stuff I don't know I ... I mean they may be every submarine\nHow old is on board they open when they give it to so that they could have something that's just on the trigger because the thing you need to have come under control from the show so it has to be somebody let the president and the prime minister\nIn Russia the president who has to keep that old throws I sent the codes a thing to have\nThat just some old ... take a response to anything would be\nWould be absolutely ... and I don't know I don't know if anybody these days is still believes that this is an evil ability and in reality in nuclear war tool out of it you can survive and you could water there was any way in my opinion\nThe type to live with your table they're all papers to Canada with low you would have seen you can use the firm on my point of view of the year she going to end up escalating everything\nSo mostly I Would say that it's probably a dangerous oh you're either going to trigger\nBut it was he a free so marine captain how old is in a safe\nAboard the vessel that they must open and then read folks from the very the very top posts and saying\nIn the event and you say well far all missiles or don't foreign ...\nRight now

be too busy they cannot take care of you\nTo many patients they cannot take care of you the answer would be to have enough nurses and the answer to that would be higher more nurses but they don't because they don't want to pay they would rather have your life be in jeopardy\nThan have to hire more nurses so what they do is they say well if we're forced to have a certain ratio well then we won't be able to have as many patients no that's not it hire more nurses don't have fewer patients\nYou're rich your big business you're massively rich\nHire more nurses others is should do is force them to take a little bit less profit and protect your life that you can protect your health better in California in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSomething similar was done and the result is that mortality

business\nDoesn't want to pay the money to address that and they pay a lot of money for these commercials to mislead you and and they don't say\nAnything about hiring more nurses they just say well if we're going to have staffing levels we can't have as many people in your weight in the ... know hire more nurses your rich\nI'm voting yes I'm disappointed that the healthcare industry would\nSubvert

those commercials they're wildly misleading\nTo short patient in the hallway and people don't stop to think oh they think is if I ... vote yes then there'll be patients more patients in the hallway\nNo man we need them to hire more nurses\nYou also having too many patients puts nurses license in jeopardy 'cause they get the cannot take correct care of patients it puts nurses license in ... in jeopardy that's right the healthcare industry does that do they care no they don't\nI guess not they don't seem to be interested in the staffing ratios so think hire more nurses don't take

it's a given that shameless plug\nI had an opportunity a list of your colleague Gatorade and he hosted a a debate between those four question why those against question one yeah and I listen to an article I guess I don't get to listen to the dead sugar gets usually try to get some sleep that point in time\nI caught his podcast swan whereas I was getting yours and he had um\nI Believe it was a woman ... bull bull persist\nNurses but one it was involved with the nursing association and one was not and then they both abruptly opposing points of view and ... just a it's a full disclosure I'm voting yes on question one in this particular case and I'm looking at it for a prospective where\nThe nursing staff thing when may get short and it's not just a situation where oh we need the flexibility of the problem that they have it gets you just like you said earlier they don't have enough there's this and in some cases the hospitals\nRefused to hire enough nurses exactly alive you that the staffing is correct that's it that's the whole thing\nThey exactly and and I also have a little bit of a personal interest in this my brother's daughter is Carly ... she's studying for her BSN which we speak so you know\nThe person on the opposing side one of the things that they tried to do here was that well if we have this ... day ban\nIt situation acts where nurse Jones\nWith no sun you don't get vitamin D production you don't get mullet\nTone in production and that\nIt can send you out of whack you know we're all in the same boat here those folks stay up overnight it's not healthy but we can't help it and there's a lot of benefits true sometimes I think she would be good to work\nIn the day but there are a lot of benefits to the overnight autonomy for one I'm\nCompletely one thousand percent autonomous in even ways I don't want to be like Mark it's me and mark for much of the night it's almost too much autonomy gets hit autonomy can bleed into the loneliness we could do at Saddam is\nA I think well you know what I'd really like to do a morning show get up at whatever time people give up to\nI guess I'm a big preparers are I'd probably get up early go in there and it you know you start you work in the morning it seems something how for you about that like a farmer\n\nMorning show people get up about the same time as farmers I guess a

hanging out say hello to everybody I don't know it seems like that'd be fun\nI have to balance though the ... the stresses of\nInteraction with people during the day and the traffic and the bright

... experience shared by a whole bunch of people everyone was grew into the same tune at the same time and you go outside on a\n\nWarm summer day and with say you're a new restrict where cars are

mortgages the guaranteed repayment from you at a hundred other people people right so yeah and they'll repackaged led into a security yeah\nI'm ... years when you buy mortgage backed security you're basically buying a little share of a hundred people's mortgages\nIncentive for you kind of on a\nLittle share of their house that's right and if they default on that on their house payment if that's a problem\nUh so that's worth Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's insurance command so if they default Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac come in and they they guarantee that payment\nOkay and is that is is this related to what happened in say two thousand eight\nSo those were different in two thousand and eight these were known as subprime mortgages so a subprime mortgage would be if you don't have a twenty percent down if it's an a speculative condo in Las Vegas or Miami a\nLame vetting on the on the purchaser\nWrites the no guaranteed income no documented income um and so you\nKnow banks were were eager to give out these mortgages these things got repackaged probably\nThe banks are going to give them up because they were guaranteed\nThey they could repackage them through some financial engineering I see 'em and in this sort of convoluted financial engineering\nThey were basically able to make what look like terrible mortgages repackaged and make them look like a ... diamonds and the rough\nAll right okay so that's a mortgage backed bonds what else\nThose those those are the four big ones I Would say um you know in terms of uh you know when you're thinking about bonds then each bond tens have different characteristics so ah\nCharacteristics are important and bond says first of all how long maturity is that right is that a one year bond a ten year bond to thirty or bomb\nYou'll get your money back with interest depending on what the maturity is if it's one year you get your money back plus the interest and you're done that's right or Thirty years right near them\nAnd so obviously you know\nIf you make the longer commitment you're you're in some ways Barrymore interest rate\nRisk right so uh today's you know you could buy a bearing more interest rate risk meaning what\nSo in this sense so if you bought a say ten year treasury right now I think ten years or ... like three three percent three uh three point one percent okay and um\nYou know\nThat's not a great interest rate does your liking him for ten\nYears risk as an opportunity because you could have taken that money at that point and put it in a CD and made more and and have more liquid actually write\n'em do that so that's not exactly the the rest of the risk is you buy today at three percent a year from now interest rates are six percent and now you're locked in to having this vehicle is paying you oh so you're going to see her sad if you'd\nGotten a shorter term one you could reinvest it at a higher rate that's right and you're missing out on that 'cause you chose ten years that's all right so long term can be a bummer but long term can be good you were talking about treasury is it time to go to the treasury bills now where do you do bonds yeah but that ...\nSo\nSt security officers treasury bills those are under a year yeah um then there's treasury notes that's two to ten years\nOr are they bonds and in fact there in effect ball given your money to the treasury are they going to give it back with interest that's\nRight so it's just it is a bond that is okay so you're talking about and imagine if you had gotten we just talked about how it's bad to get locked in not always resonate if in Nineteen eighty seven to ... new body thirty year treasury bills or bond\nAnd you're locked in sixteen percent for Thirty years insane\nYep you looked pretty good shut it looked pretty good at worrying man right I mean it's just pretty worry free yup yup and but in Nineteen eighty two you did not know that inflation was going to be brought under control you ought to put yourself back in the early eighties when oil prices and inflation was running\nYeah but you know what in hindsight is this for me and I'm not telling you what to do any time you get it for like sixteen percent if you look at the ... the top and the bottom of what your interest rates are\n... if that's a pretty safe thing if I had to do it over again easy easy to say I feel like if I knew how good sixteen present really was regardless of the end of the\nInflation\nI probably grab it if I had a chance to do that now anyway\nNow pros and cons of bonds which takes let's take some cons of bonds so some downside and various situations\nSo so I think three big big risks right so one is interest rates and sort of\nOne oh one overall interest rates go up the price of the bond goes down and prices\nOf on goes down doesn't affect you much unless you sell the bond is it just goes to\nMaturity that price doesn't matter that is right except if you're in a bond fund if you're in a bond fund and that's the case and the overall value of your pieces of pie goes down some that's correct can you explain how that more so I can understand it better\nYeah so so for an individual investor I'm buying specific bond says is probably not very efficient way to get a sort of diversified portfolio um bonds are ...\nAre expensive to to buy and sell 'em for retail investors it's almost impossible to have corporate bonds I'm\nOK for individuals like folks listening ... chances are that is not going to be not going to work out generally doesn't yeah so there are alternatives yes\nSo the alternative is to invest in say a\nA bond mutual fund so this is a mutual fund that holds a big basket of say corporate bonds government bonds what have you depending on the fund and\nBecause then you've got to take advantage of the economies of scale bond that is right bunch of what they save by buying a a bunch and plus you you have diversification safety that's right\nAnd they're going to manage their interest rate risk which they considered to ration um that's just a measure of interest rate risk they're going to keep that serve basically constant\nAnd the fund so that they're always sort of adjusting to fund um for you know to sort of opt to look up on the condition\nYou know is there any chance you can stay later 'cause you're good and we haven't finished ... okay\nCool because I Want to find out more about was we've only done three questions on bonds and that was the main topic please feel free to ask questions about bonds use what we talked about so far maybe you've always wanted something about bonds well this is your chance free human not robo advice to somebody busy\nA lot happens while you're asleep morning I'm Jonathan Weiner joining alone there are named ... around two am\nFollowing our only by the time you're getting and having your first cup of coffee\nHere to bring all the news from around the world to know because you're whether together any more they accuweather\nShower responsibility to make sure you the best in the morning\nBecause we live here too easy names when the dirty\nW Veasey buses WXXI Kay s F ... two men for an eye heart radio station [noise]\nBusiest W Veasey news radio ten thirty with a new one [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat's right so normally normally a bond fund would have a regular payment right that would be um\nThat they promise you or it fluctuates they promise within range how does that work\nI they're they're not going to promise you it\nTypically the average of all the coupon interest and the ... that's right okay so you're going to get some actual coupon interest yeah okay so even though the value of\nThis finding itself might cut down you are getting still in addition and separate from that the coupon interest to me that's that's important question as your typically\n\nOther exceptions\nSo so I think it it really depends on the product writes us on Sunday or just going to reinvest that within the fund yeah right and so that's going to be built into your your accumulated certain that as a value the fund is going to increase in value how over time by the value that coup so that would\nThat coupon interest a counter balances any loss you might have to do the value of the prince about the bond itself the marketing department I tell you that you have two things going on the market value at the bottom and the coupon interest\nAnd in some cases you might just get the coupon interest and other ... you might get the average of all the couponing interests right or it might be backed in a kind of has ah\nIt might just be basic part of the whole reinvest it into new bond so the coupon interests would come into the fund right and the fund manager would then take that coupon interest and re invested in Dubai\nAnd so in that case why do you get is\nA combination of the fluctuation in the market value and the coupon interest desperate and some cases the market value micro down\nSo that might reduce your coupon than just a little bit but you still bet couponing she says the factor that's right you're not wholly dependent on the market value of the bonds you know the market value of the bonds may bring the total value down a bit\nSo so this is the the interesting and I write I just want to do I have it that's right okay right so so when you raise interest rates there's sort of these two effects right on the one hand the valley\nThe bond falls in terms of price terms but\nYour coupon interests that you're getting gets reinvest that at a higher interest rate oh okay so those two sometimes can be offsetting I'm at a few timeline rising longer the reinvestment effective investment in higher interest rates actually\nProbably dominates\nOh All right the uh so I was bombing that out you know if I if I had a bond bomb and I was concerned that if I had a a bond and a rising interest rates and then I was being dumb or a bond fund that I was being down but not necessarily\nI don't think so okay good it depends on how smart the managers that that's good well we have some questions you ready sorry okay you never know what you're going to get you ready yep okay we'll see how many more conspiracy theorists we have\nWe have a first mia David in Boston this is good solid actionable info\n[noise] Dave how\nAre you good I'm I'm calling I had a question about ... bonds but it just dawned on me that I have some double re launch believe it or not that I bought some of the well Thirty years ago I avoid it Thirty years because\nIt interests for that length of time and then they stop\nAnd I put them on my name and the beneficiaries in a man I'm Around to cash them now but a visa have fallen out of favor of a notch and and I wondered why\nWhen I was tough for us to hear what type of bomb they were\nThey're double either called the police and they're very popular for example the ones I have a more popular are the ones I have or face value a thousand dollar bonds that you would pay five hundred dollars for\nAnd then over the thirty year period you could catch them before Thirty years but for example I avoided the thirty\nOh and show I go to the bank and collect about twenty four hundred dollars dubberly\nBonds I'm the savings bonds and they were low risk Jennings products that and they get interest for I ... up to Thirty years right up to only way to buy him was to buy 'em in the electronic form and and I think he treasury just direct right\nWell you can buy them at the bank and and those days oh All right All right so I don't\nI don't uh they're no longer issued in the paper form right\nNo you can't do it at the bank anymore okay but I Wonder why they are not a falling out of favor\nBut I guess so I I I think it had they've\nThey've been effectively replaced by treasury direct um so now you can basically by treasuries\nI'm In small small quantities directly from the treasury did they do need to do these extra\nBut of course the interest on them is very low I understand so in any case I'm not buying them but my question to you or the reason for my call was on municipal bonds and the fact that I had bought those sold the house was several hundred thousand dollars and I was able to lock in five percent\nAnd what about twelve years but then they got cold and I wonder if you didn't distinguish between call ability and non call ability and the fact that you could actually I've learned that you could specify when you buy immune eight\nOr that you are a non call level is is this correct now I'm not sure about the interest will be considerably less than a ...\nThat's correct so so for the rest of our listeners just to make sure we understand what it called the bond is\nA a ... bond gives the ensure the bond the rights to basically re purchase that bond prior to maturity so it could have been a thirty year bond\nBut you know they\nThey could buy it for power or for a slight premium as say after Fifteen Years um and so that that that option to the company or the ... that issues the bond is is valuable to them\nAnd so in return for that option they're willing to pay you a higher interest rate up front\nI ... when I get called ... which is that bad\nSo it's it's it's\nBad for investors perspective right because typically the bonds are calling or paying higher interest rates than current interest rates but in some ways you've already received your return right you've made your reward because you've got higher interest rate for a longer period of time\nHere yes I'm sure there's like a question relating\nImmunity from was there was those municipal bonds was the ... the money that you earned was that tax free tax free and that's pretty damn federal you're you're a smart guy I guess\nFive percent when we get five percent today but I guess I haven't checked originally but if the market's down I guess manager up\n[laughter] so do you have any further questions first David yes I just wanted to distinguish or\nAsk 'em I'm Ryan\n... you're buying a mutiny our general obligations would you recommend a general obligation over a revenue bond which is more security\nAre typically it's going to be a general obligation so I can so that the distinction here is a journal obligation is backed by the um by the basically the tax base of the town I'm whereas uh\nThe the revenue ones are based on a specific thing so it could be you know a swimming pool or ... or you know\nParticular asset that the town an Arab age to earn the money isn't there are days\nOr so more risk yeah so ... is a general rule the general obligation because of the town and I was raised tax revenue\nGeneral obligation is better for them that point of view also I just wanted to share you know on the treasury bonds or you mentioned there are not taxable oh they are taxable but not to the state only federal\nThere is no bond treasury bond it's taxable to the state like correct on that I don't know if\nWe talk about that well the professor managing their taxable federally\nMhm are not taxable state was correct\nI I'm not a hundred percent sure on all at once oh\nOkay well that's the way but doing my taxes for fifty years\nSo I guess that's the hardest thank you\nDavid now it's Jim and it's time for a break and then we'll get to Jim and Jim and Mike identity busy\nJames Bradley J.

probably why he was a little fuzzy on the war bonds 'cause I guess they may not have had more bones so I Want to go back\nTo the target date funds and I think that a lot of folks might find them attractive way it works is you know I'll just took it off\nThe research say you plan on retiring in seven years so you might pick a\nTarget date twenty twenty five that's right fund and that'll be all sort of set up knowing that you don't have time to regain any losses you're going to need some income so and so it's probably going to be\nWhat Ryan\nIn terms of mix and yeah\nAll about say twenty twenty five ... somebody that might be preparing to retire and seven years\nYeah so that that ... going to be very conservative it's it would I Would not surprise me that the that fun would maybe have eighty percent of bonds\nBonds yeah what ... what sort of bonds would they likely have doesn't matter\nSo a target date fund invested in other mutual funds was in the complex of it's a fidelity target date fund that defined itself is then allocating across the different Fidel like fun\nIt's not going to black rock\nWell it could it could okay it could uh but typically they would keep it in complex\nOkay and there would be conservative and a lot of bonds and the goal is to what about\nWhen people need income or are they gonna by the way they're gonna keep that fund\nPast twenty twenty five I Would just generally more income or they done at twenty twenty twenty five\nNow that that fund would continue on\nOkay so now it's that you retired in ... when he joins that's right and you ain't working and you're probably going to need income mhm how does it generate income for you\nSo\nYou know again this is that this will depends specifically on the fund right I'm okay for an example\nHow one might one find might generate income so so defined could be set up to give you sort of regular disbursement\nThe you know pain when does it come from is it comes it's coming from them it's coming from the fund itself right the income that defines generates always coming from income\nThat defines generating or like who um who bananas however says it\nCould be from sales of the CDs it could it could be from the\nSale of principle of the bonds and the fund the bonds of one could mature right and then you're going to have every afternoon money um\nAnd instead of investing in something you might take some of that cash that we got a burning up principle if you're spending money from a bond sale right unless it's a profit from bond sale\nSuicide you read the the funds\nIf ... if you if it uses funds from bond bond sales right to disperse view\nAnd if\nYou don't have a ... as much to reinvest ... correct it starts to dwindle the principal\nRight so the principle that the the bounces these funds overtime should decree\nOkay I'm actually twenty twenty five at least right probably gonna see yourself losing some principle\nAnd that's kind of kind of actuaries you out to figure out how long you might live and how long you might need the money\nAnd the thing yeah I think that that's a\nFair way okay do you happen to know how long they and you probably don't just checking expect someone to live after retirement these days is Twenty years\nIt's funny so I actually look that up today I'm sixty five a life expectancy for men is to live live for so you're eighty four and for women it's to live to about eighty six eighty seven years old\nOkay so you're looking at if if nothing hits the fan ... needing cash for Twenty years\nThat's right and I think most people do not think in those terms I think in those terms right there you know and and then this this also comes back to whether you want how conservative you really want to be if you need to preserve your\nYour wealth over a twenty year period right the key is to\nCan you can you say you're going to retire and joining twenty five according to fund and then to find behaves like he retired but you just keep working\n...\nOkay 'cause that's where people are going to have to do right how many people your guests have enough money to survive in the ... mode which they become accustomed Twenty years after retirement\nYou you know like it's at twenty five or something twenty five percent yeah it's probably even lower than that I mean the ah thirty percent of people have less than ten thousand dollars thirty eight hundred people there he was out of the entire a demographic or older people\nTen percent at thirty percent of people retire okay our retirement have less than ten thousand dollars in savings [noise] um and I think if you go up to the you know in the if you go to like two hundred and fifty thousand um\nYou know I I think it's it's it's like ten Fifteen Percent of people have that much in savings a retirement and two hundred and fifty thousand if your plan living for another\nTwenty years um is not enough I not\nAlright there's nowhere to ours are up thank you very much

I'll do bombs again you can do bonds three times you don't learn as all at once\nThat's important I Know about bonds if you're getting older and it may be an option for your portfolio you may think portfolio sounds like a rich person thing but if you have a four O. one K. or retirements you might have what's called the portfolio\nAnd you might want to know about the things that make up your portfolio and how they might react\nIn different market conditions conditions like rising interest rates or rising stock market or the reverse how do they react\nI did go to school for there's a little bit when I was in college I was I got an actual business minor I didn't even do that I even forgot I had a business minor how 'bout that oh it's so long ago or I care so little about it\nOr something I got I have a business minor I didn't even know that for what that's worth\nHuh\nAnd I also when I got out of school came to Boston immediately lived on lived on ... avenue like most people who move here really it seems by service liquors\nIn the Seventeen hundred a lark I didn't know what I Want to do you know I was working at TGI Fridays\nAnd didn't really have a career in mind\n[noise] so I took this course on how to be is a a mutual funds salesperson I never took this test you know what I hated it I have to be in any kind of a salesperson was not me it's weird to think back when I had no direction\nAt that time and it it makes me sad when I see kids what do you want to be I don't know really you got ... what do you like doing on I don't know what are you into more I don't know I have to remember I didn't either so I had gone to college\nActually I'd gone to I've been I've been an operating room technician how's elbows even people operating on them\nFor three years of school and doing it for three years then went to college college was just fun\nIt was a lot of learning involved but it was just fun compared to working compared to being under stress in the in the healthcare environment it was a just a blast and that was about that was a little older than the other kids like a year or two and I\nThis other life and they're worried about passing their causes I didn't care I just have I didn't worry about I I passed everything and never failed anything\nBut I didn't get great grays either it was more about debating and arguing and the memorial union building an and and interacting with smart people that's what it was about for me\nSo they were kind of threatened things I was just thrilled tickled pink every minute of college\nWhat you mean people can go to this place called the campus and they can just kind of go to classes and learn stuffing and drink beer and not work and society is okay with that\nSigned me up people say college is the best time of your life I don't know about that but it was right up there\nIt really was awesome and I didn't even think I Would like college my parents never said oh man you're gonna like college\n\nThey never encouraged me to go to college they didn't they didn't make me understand how awesome I was I had no idea even after\nIt was only after working in the hospital for like two and a half years and I met someone somehow they went to you and age and I went and visited them and saw what life was like I was blown away I said this I Want this\nMy grades weren't great in high school and I want to go to college so\nI guess I kind of a quiz myself I'd distinguish myself pretty well in hospitals environment so doctors and nurses they wrote me recommendations and I got in and this is back when you didn't have to\nDo massively in that I mean you had to go some in dead but not like now it didn't weigh on you for your whole life\nLike now\nSo then I got to Boston still didn't know what I wanted to do this here we've come full circle I Am I don't know what I Want to do\nAs a it's a bad place to be not knowing what you want to do not having a reason to get up in the morning just kind of model of the law I feel bad when I see see kids muddling along and then I got to remember that was me modeling along not too long ago\nSo basically what happened is\nGot to Boston I was working a TGI Fridays I was doing college radio and I took this course but it didn't didn't want to do that and then the college radio became a real hobby\nAnd then very shortly in the Boston Market you're lucky at the time you were lucky because the people who are in charge of big time radio were also involved in college radio so if you were in college radio involvement they knew who you were and when they needed to hire people\nI was very fortunate that my boss the very great an honorable edifice\nHired from the college ranks as the way it was and that's the way it was in that'd be CNN that's the way it was with a lot of pasta unlike other cities I think\nSo in Nineteen eighty\nOne wow huh [noise] now did anyone than here in town for\nUm a little over ... over a year two years maybe\nI started it'd be CNN started and then I had my ... my career my thing so I'm very fortunate to have my sting established\nThat early in life and then the key to success was taken seriously\nDon't screw up really really pay attention to business prepare work hard don't screw up take it seriously you know just\nSome people didn't treat it seriously and are gone they're gone right away to the other great things that ...\nWho's going to be an overnight and then we were going to move on\nThere was a snack and\nWell I'll tell you about this nagging or have a whole minute before the break there was a snack and this is from Gorbachev was there and then there was a window right and started to be started to tighten up\nClose up again so somehow the Rolling Stones got cancelled but there was a ... a contest rules the law says you have to make good on your contest so instead of seeing the Rolling Stones in Moscow you saw the wrongs comes in\nOver in Copenhagen\nWhere my boss had already been a ... a bunch you said I don't want to go to Copenhagen stay here I said okay we'll catch him on the way back okay so we hung out and I was thinking and we

and I love that photo Russian soldiers dorky park also I think it was in ... park was a circus it was a circus in a big tent\nAnd Russia's really Russians really like circuses they know how to do circus is huge tent\n\nAnd since it was a super hot day you know sometimes on super hot days you get really bad storms well this is one of those days during this gigantic tent\nAnd I can't imagine that\nThere's any much oversight on the safety of these towns in Russia huge tent safe there we're going to put the barn and vitamin Bailey three ring circus in one town there would be like that downpour\nYou could hear it on top of the tent it's got to be scary yours funder and lightning and wham bam and pouring down\nIt felt like a lake was landing on top of the ... and in fact sections

and it's pouring and it's fun to end the lightning and then [noise] section of this tense let's go and they must have been water pulling up and all that water and and loaded on people\nAnd uh so that there's that memory\nI never married is going to have a record store a Russian record store as you might guess a lot of the records or Russian but not all I mean there are far more western records the rest of the Russian records and you can get a premium for rent western records\nA in a communist country as a matter of fact a friend of mine in Brooklyn her boyfriend used to make money by smuggling western records to communist Poland you get on the train in West Berlin\nAnd clandestinely go to some small town in Poland not even get off\nThe door with open ... it'd be something that a change money give money give records boom done back to Berlin that's that's what's what what life was like ten\nThere anyway so we went to the record store and there was a David Bowie record all in Russian spotless pristine cover it was orange and black\nAnd my boss got me that record isn't that cool\nThat's kind of looked at all the way but all the way back home for the frame on it it's in a frame now orange and black very beautiful other events\n\nWell again my boss likes to be an interactive and ... my ... loves adding to his legacy there's no crime and that I'm happy to help you dude he ... he wanted to and I'm sure he wanted me to report on it and we took a picture and everything he wanted to be the ... the program director of the people\nAnd uh\nYou know what to do that you had to do common man things and so I think it might have been ... park but somewhere like that there was a ... an equivalent of a soda machine\nBut it wasn't cans I wasn't even soda it was a machine you put in some money\nAnd it was a glass kind of like now you put a coffee cup there and a copy machine but this was a disposable cup this was a glass glass you drink out of a new he put it back for the next person in Moscow probably a thousand people that I use it\nSo he said All right I'm going to drink out of his class I'm going to do this\nWhich is money and\nAnd it don't dispense soda it's expensive to serve the kind of like his Iraq's members are it's kind of some syrup and some water whose gross\nAnd he did it he's rank right out of it I don't think he got sick with magic that now would you drink out of a class there was a public glass in a city\nYou [laughter] my God no he did it and there's a photo [noise] what else we did go to this wild museums fills with\nDiamond encrusted course harnesses and oh God diamond and crushed the dresses\nThat was it was way over the top you know so much of the stuff that tourists are attracted to this is the result of\nCheating cheating the people

I like about anything you what I have a pilots have to talk about [noise] I uh [noise]\nNot a giant fan of Hillary Clinton but I'm coming to the conclusion that if I were to be her strategist I could

plan\nSeriously yeah I'm actually considered of learning my strategy and sending it to her and say look\nFor two hundred thousand dollars a week I Will be one of your campaign strategist why do I get

the weird weathers last night did anybody see any hail I mean there's all kinds of stuff to talk of of course the bombs\nThis is the big news I I'm not going to base the entire show on and talk about as more likes tomorrow night I like to give ... times of\nPercolate but there's the bombs again I mentioned before do\nWell does the president have any sort of culpability in this do you think that his endorsement of violence especially towards journalists\nSymbols and people like bombers makes it okay makes it morally okay\nHey the president says be violent I guess it's OK and those folks are looking for an excuse by the way what we're talking about it at some point do you think the president will actually have a call on people to pick up arms against liberals\nDig up arms against someone trying to get him out of office are we going to get to that point okay let's go first to\nJenny in women hello Jenny badly they how you feel on the evening I'm married yeah I had my ... I had my no you've ... you've had your ... high walk on the back of my size man\nI Know but it is I I I told the marks that I think that they um that the young lady must have squeezed your head too tight leash with ... says that it's the comment you made about anyone that can see anything good personally and Donald Trump\nNo I didn't say that at all what if you embrace their of course I Know why anyone has good ... good qualities okay if you say I like that guy than that you know we're getting to the point where that's a problem\nThat's not the Germany were precious older cats than an avid and Nineteen thirty eight\n\nReally regarding leading up to that I Know I Know it was just going to say I know what you're talking about I still think\nWe're talking about it so much we're on the waiting room mocked\nAnd an enormous enormous overreach and I think it's insulting to those pressure cells that died I really do\nI Enron is not at all\nOh I absolutely I think it is well you're wrong but that well for every once in title you do that sometimes you you can't tell people their opinions are on you can say their facts are wrong\nBut I Know your your opinions wrong\nHow can end up paying him [laughter] [laughter] it can be and it can be it has to be based or if it's wrong though in any event I ...\nA light on it I can make the case and ensure you to be wrong well I don't I don't think you could I not insulting to those pressures souls because right down the road where they will be ... you know who\nSent these devices no okay do you know that over Ninety percent of the hate crimes reported for Donald Trump took office at and basically con jobs either lied about are done by themselves to make it look\nI have I have the stamina saying the president I'm just saying are you aware that I'm aware that you're telling me that\nOkay well you can look it up and see how many of the hate crimes that had been reported have been either out to the perpetrator\nBut that doesn't change okay and your piece go ahead yeah\nWell I'm just saying listen I didn't vote for this guy didn't vote for Hillary either I voted for Bob peddling\nMayor way that I wrote it so but my point is I I really do think people\nYou have to talk about fat you have to know what you're talking about before you can make these broad reaching statements generally what I'm Talking about the can I just finished place when Steve college was shot nobody turn to to Bernie Sanders or anybody else to say what prompted him to shoot\nI'll tell you why sign as long as they're endorsing and telling people to hey I Love when your body to them that journalist that's why the bomb\nIt when Obama said that faces\nYou know that can be broad reaching to sew anything I'm not saying the guy I should say half what he says but you can't you can't already put responsibility on him for something that you don't even know where it's going to lead you don't even know whether or not it's anyone that even likes you don't know anything but you don't know what triggers somebody you don't know who's done it\nSo I just think it's I think as this\nDo you do feel that ah those kinds of statements which there's a list of like hey Buddy Roemer journalists that's my kind of guy using ... people\nI don't know they would in Boulder kind of to do this I think it's a ... statement I wouldn't make it so\nSo you wouldn't know what I\nSaid I don't know that it would in Boulder and trauma to do that status I I go I think again I'd probably taking another step who knows what triggered somebody has already clearly going to be a highly either just trying to somebody and send somebody on another path or\nThey actually did have you with candidate and the head we're kind of pre World War two German here that\nI can tell you that as someone who is a registered independent and didn't vote for either one of these people\nThe fear that I have felt for people that I Know it just sort of the country it as a whole\nUm with violence than aggression had come from the left\nEspecially it did you ever see the video of it you know that that the one in Portland now with elderly man I'm Talking about all the other ones especially at a place like Portland where some poor man I'm a journalist that jail because he pulled a gun because he was surrounded by um odd and being threatened\nAnd he got arrested and jailed pulling the gun\nUm there was another man out there that is ...\nGlasses stolen off its phases even try to walk into a building by him off and hit and be I mean they they\nNeed a young man okay so you don't go on and on wait\nDon't you think the statements by the president also Wimbledon the left to violence\nNow I think they were already there\nYou know I think that the only guy vitamin K that works for an all bad all people and so you're going to be involved in both on the right and on the left\nI was going to say that professor to hit the kitten ahead but the bike lock and you can hear him crack his head like metal bike lock you know there's so many things where people were talking about they rallied the than\nI Am ready to I'm trying to make the point it doesn't matter which side you on your on the other thing like that in both in violence in all\nPeople are naturally and most of my best my I have you admit\nThat he that this is a an unhealthy thing and that he has to take some responsibility for this he's the president is\nNot for this new young all sides\nWhy would he take responsibility for for people from\nThe tone for violence\nWhen an chief of the day that he was a ... ...\nAm it in the olden antifa too can I just and I know because\nMy running out of time you had all six minutes and seven seconds\nBut you you can't say that he embolden people from it and ... and the gas to his election ... buildings and cars are threatened people in their\nCar I mean I suppose I mean I think do you yeah well I'm not ... answering the change in my ...
