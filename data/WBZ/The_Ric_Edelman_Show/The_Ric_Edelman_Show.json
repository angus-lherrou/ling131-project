[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAre joining me today on the record holding show we've been talking about twenty seven percent of Americans stopped saving for retirement [noise]\nThey were so spooked by two thousand eight\nThey'd lost so much money so rapidly that scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in\nCash oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done its tripled in value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year because that's what you know bank accounts have been paying over the last ten years zero point nothing\nOnly ten percent of people in the survey said they invest more today than they were in two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were and\nAlmost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\n\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand eight and only forty one percent say they feel fully recovered financially in the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history\nWith the stock market tripling and values since the steps of two thousand nine the majority of Americans still say\nThat they earn behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem\nAnd just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials said they believed that they need at least a thousand dollars to start investing Seventeen percent say they think they need at least ten thousand dollars\nTo start investing that's simply true anymore due to advanced technology you can invest\nIt you can open an account with the dollar not a thousand not ten thousand I'm not suggesting you should necessarily do that\nBefore you joined your retirement planning worker before you pay off credit card debt or before you Bill cash reserves but the point is it doesn't take a lot of money anymore to build investments\nAnd oh by the way\nA lot of parents are are not saving a lot either it's not just the millennials but the millennials parents that aren't saving a lot and you know one big reason for that I'm going to tell you what it is that parents are spending five hundred billion dollars on every single\nYear and no it's not their kids who are on the playground K. through twelve ... it's not raising children that ... that parents are spending a lot of money on it something else which is preventing them from saving and investing\nGuess what they're spending that money on according to a new study by age wave parents are spending five hundred billion dollars a year\nUnder Eighteen to thirty four year old children\nThey're spending on their adult kids twice as much as what they are contributing to their retirement accounts two thirds of parents say they have to sacrifice their own financial security for the sake of their children who were in their twenties and thirties\nSeventy three percent said that they factor their finances into the decision of becoming a parent in the Nineteen eighties only thirty three percent of people in their twenties and thirties did that the average cost of raising a child today is now about a quarter of a million dollars\nNine out of ten parents say they're surprised at how much money they spent by becoming a parent\nAnd nearly two thirds say they encounter financial difficulties associated with parenting\nEven children who are living independently are receiving financial support from their parents parents are contributing to school costs health insurance rent car expenses parents or even paying for food and for cell phone service for their adult children\nThe numbers are rather astonishing\nThirty one percent of Americans who were ages Eighteen to thirty four thirty one percent we're talking basically one at a free of people in their twenties and thirties or living with their parents we actually have more people who in their twenties and thirties living with their parents than living with a spouse\nThat something new and different for the society\nParents are saying they're not going to be off the hook anytime soon fifty nine percent say they expect to help pay for their children's weddings okay nothing new about that mom and dad have been paying for their daughters weddings for pretty much forever but twenty six percent say they're expecting to contribute to their children's first tones\nThirty three percent expect to contribute to their grandchildren's college costs so it's not just your pain for the wedding for the kid you're paying for the house you're paying for their kids' education as well\nAnd here's what's really shocking an amazing about this the reason the parents are providing so much financial support to their kids is because the kids are unable to handle this on their own independently maybe it's because kids didn't grow up with any financial education they are financially illiterate\nAnd yet about sixty percent of parents say that they taught their children the benefits of investing a really\nSolo why sea island has risen to Seventeen hundred and sixty three with more than five thousand feared

B. news radio [laughter] [noise]\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the wrist that'll show off the Charlotte Hi Marilyn chefs on the phone welcome to the program Chet how are you [noise]\nI Am great Rick thank you very much how can I read several your books and uh watch listen to your show for years\nAnd I guess my question is now that I'm Seventy three have been taken this are empty requirement or how should I take that I've been taking at an annual basis in December should it be taken a monthly yearly a percentage or I kind of like a a thought of a reverse\nDollar cost averaging method\nThat's exactly what you're doing that's exactly right so let me back up and let everybody know what we're talking about here if you have a retirement account such as an IRA or a retirement account at work like a four O. one K. or for three baby or the first savings plan has a federal employee if you have any kind of these retirement accounts\nStarting at age Seventy and a half you have to begin making withdrawals out of the account\nNow the rules are very complicated in technical in terms of when you have to start\nA and how much you have to withdraw and which account you must make withdrawals from if you don't follow the rules very carefully you could not only in her taxes but you also encourage penalties of as much as fifty percent\nOf what you were supposed to have withdrawn but didn't so you've got to make sure you get it right but here's the point once you do start to make these withdrawals\nThese are called required minimum distributions the IRS tells you how much you must withdraw there is a minimum amount you must withdraw and it's required hence the name are empty required minimum distribution\nWhen you begin to do it you have a choice you can take\nThe money is a single lump sum once a year or you can take the money during the year whenever you feel like it or you can do it systematically such as taking the same amount of money every month like clockwork so you get a monthly check out of your account just like you would get a Social Security check\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it\nProvided you do\nIt consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said you were doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging in reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life\nIf you want her to do it on a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's fine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you will generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the accounts of the time what I'm more concerned\nAbout is not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conforming ths with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I mean by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name another IRA and her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts but\nWe separately care if any of those accounts were\nFor a one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from a four O. one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount failing to take it from the proper accounts\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdraw\nThis is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money once every month the IRS doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the account on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nBased on last year's market values\nConversely you could accidentally withdraw too much more than is necessary causing you to pay taxes unnecessarily so the calculations are complicated\nHow much you're going to save for retirement I'm going to say for college how much you're going to save for say home buying or buying a boat or whatever it is you want to save for you tell me how much money you're going to save and in fact more importantly you go ahead and do that once you're saving enough money to achieve your goals\nI don't really care how you spend the rest of your money it doesn't matter anymore\nBecause you've already saved in other words pay yourself first ... once you save money\nYou can then spent all the rest of your money and don't worry if you run out of it did you ever noticed that you run out of money the end of the ...\nThe problem is you run out of money before you've saved for your future so if you treat yourself as a bill if you treat yourself as a creditor you must pay by participating in their retirement plan at work or saving a mutual fund or who knows what then\nThe rest of it goes away and the need for budgeting disappears it's as simple as that know by the way to him\nWhat you've been doing has been working for you\nGreat keep on doing it my concern is that people are engaged in behaviors that aren't working and all they do is feel badly that they are not sticking to their budget or that they haven't been able to show the discipline to do what they need to do\nAs you listen to the advice and information

amount of money to finance their spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties and how it's\nImpacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement and how kids are now recognizing that they're struggling with their own personal finances but it's not just\nThe parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going\nTo be able to accumulate enough money on their own there's another survey that shows the reversal of this that it's going back up line sixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior\nEven sixty four percent of teenagers are concerned about their parent's ability to retire so in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even those sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement sixty nine percent of teenagers say they know little or nothing about financial planning well\nActually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parent's ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security well that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad\nAnd they're worried about you first of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but that's a whole another conversation but here's the problem teenagers in fact\nAs we pointed out earlier on the program today\nThey know very little about personal finance one third of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for this\nAnd if you're driving the car you might want to pull over as I give you this is just a one third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire oh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nA hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life costs they don't understand how expensive car czar or houses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad\nYou haven't told them a ... thing so my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your teenager sit along side you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook letting them participate\nIn games with them when you send me go talking about investments include them in the conversation your kids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried\nYou

I therefore don't have to say for my future wrong don't assume your employer\nWill honor its obligations don't assume you'll get as much money as they are promising don't assume you'll get money for as long as they're promising you need to save for retirement as though the pension doesn't exist fabulous great if you do end up getting the pension good for you nobody ever yelled at me because they ended up saving too much money you know what I'm saying so\nBe careful it's really the simple answer whether you worked for a state or local government what do you work for a union dare I even say you work for the federal government you need to assume\nThat these entities will struggle to meet their financial obligations obligations they took\nDecades ago under a very different economic environment

often talk about the Social Security trust fund and the fact that it's slowly being depleted so someone say not so slowly\nOver the next ten to twelve years it's going to be wiped out that trust fund is at risk of being completely depleted dope has talked about all this and more importantly what's going on in the retirement security marketplace and what does the field of behavioral finance got to do with all this I'm happy to bring on to the program Brigitte ...\nWho's a professor of public policy in corporate management at Harvard University she's also Dina Brigham Young University of Maryland School of business Bridget thank you so much for joining us on the program it's my pleasure to be here\nSo bridges also retirement commissioner of the bipartisan Policy Center she got her PHD in economics from MIT and it's a two time recipient of the ... award for scholarly research on lifelong financial security\nSo you're one of those experts that people like me love ... love to talk about all the time so let me start with a little quiz you're you're going to know the answer to this but I Want to see how well our listeners do in this cute little quiz you're ready for this I'm ready\nSo if I were to give you a penny or a woman ten chance to win ten cents which would you choose the penny\nOr the one in ten chance to win a dime\nMe I Would pick the one in ten chance to win a dime\nYeah I I think most of our listeners will agree with you on that now let me change the question will hear a little bit let's say I were to give you ten million dollars for a woman ten chance to get a hundred million now which would you pick\nNow I'd pick the ten million for sure\nAnd I think most folks would agree with you on that but here's the fascinating thing and of course you realize this in both cases the chances of success or one in ten they haven't changed and since the one in ten hasn't changed your answer shouldn't have changed either\nClassic economics says the both should result in the same attitude but you've demonstrated a very different attitude between the penny versus the ten million dollars and that's the core of behavioral economics isn't it\nYeah that's exactly the court now next that uh the psychology with which we approach financial decision making often result in different answers that if we were to be purely rational logical and consistent with all of the financial choices we make\nAnd the crazy thing is that Richard Thaler won the Nobel Prize last year for his work and behavioral finance and also there was a Nobel one and two thousand two on the same subject but what took so long for the field of economics to figure this out\nThe fact that humans don't act rationally the markets aren't rational because humans are emotional creatures what took so long for everybody to figure that out why is it only just now finally becoming part of public policy\nThe interesting thing is if you go back and read Adams met his often cited as the father of modern economics you as\nA you know writing back in the Seventeen hundreds or he very much a behavioral economist in the Nineteen thirties and an attempt to to be taken more seriously a as a as a science kind of started using mathematical model with people being rational\nSo it's only been I you know more recently that has caused economists to to rethink their model of how people do make decisions as to ... to as opposed to how maybe they should make decisions\nGive me one example of how that's translated into the marketplace affecting ordinary folks\nAh companies are now moving towards automatic enrollment you're automatically enrolled in a savings plan unless you opt out the U.S is encouraging that um other countries that have gone and you know a step further so the u._k. several\nYears ago a rolled out of pension for reform and they are requiring employers to use automatic enrollment and they've seen the fraction of their workforce that's participating in a retirement savings plan increase by more than twenty five percentage points and the span of four or five years\nAnd in fact I was truly does the same thing they have a nine and a half percent mandatory were contribution for their retirement savings for every employee in the country and so their savings compared to other nations is huge and these theories of personal finance improve how we think about Social Security and the challenges it's facing\nI think they can sell a one interesting feature of Social Security is that you can start claiming it as early as age sixty two ah but if you wait and start claiming the benefits later your monthly check will be higher\nUm and that creates an incentive a financial incentive to delay claiming but if you can get people to start thinking of that reason why it might be beneficial for them to delay claiming Social Security ... a later age you can get people to\nUh you know move away from the mindset of oh it's available at a ticket right away\nThis is a bit of a challenge I remember reading studies where they put a five year old and a room with a candy bar\nAnd they say that the child if you don't eat the candy bar now later we'll give you two almost every kid takes the candy bar immediately the notion of delayed gratification is really difficult to overcome compared to our desire for immediate gratification so when you said or retiree\nHow

mean let's face it we've got some big challenges in big issues and the political debates and\nUh we all know what's going on right but I just want to help you put it into perspective I just finished reading an awesome book I read a lot of\nA technological uh books and I read a lot of early American history books and uh and the book I just finished it's called the butchering art\nIt's the biography of Joseph Lister this was the guy who a physician surgeon actually who figured out that Germans exist and it's because of infections\nThat surgical patients were dying in the Eighteen hundreds\nAnd it's a fascinating story of the history of medicine as we began to learn about a quarter form the ability to give patients anesthesia are recognizing that we can combat germs um\nIn fact Listerine is named after just lister anyway I Want to read you this very short to paragraph excerpt from the book to give you a contrast of medicine in the Eighteen hundreds\nCompared to today quote the injuries and afflictions that surgeons dealt with were as varied as London's population itself\nThousands of workers migrated to the city each year not only with these people living in filth due to the shortage of housing brought on by such rapid urbanization but their jobs were both physically demanding and hazardous\nA hospital awards were clog with people who have been named blinded suffocated and crippled by the hazardous realities of the modernizing world\nBetween Eighteen thirty four and Eighteen fifty sharing cross hospital treated sixty six thousand emergencies including sixteen thousand falls from scaffolds or buildings\nThirteen hundred accidents involving steam engines milk hogs or cranes five thousand road crashes and two thousand burns ore scouts\nA newspaper reported that almost a third of these injuries were caused by quote broken glass or porcelain casual falls lifting weights and in cautious use the spokes knives and other domestic implements

fifty million for the first time since the world bank has been collecting data starting in Nineteen Ninety this is the decline of more than one million people in the past twenty five years this is truly exciting we had\nOne point seven million in extreme poverty now its point seven million and oh by the way what do they mean by extreme poverty\nPeople living on less\nThan a buck Ninety a day yeah we still have a lot of work to do but boy we making great progress so feel good things are excited\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the Rick Edelman show we're talking with Donald ... an

collecting Social Security benefits right but\nYou didn't mention two of the biggest reasons that I uh favorite and a one way to eight Seventy to get your benefits or is it is true and it isn't advantageous in the meantime uh after full retirement age at least your\nBenefits go eight percent tax free where where else can I get ... percent tax free\nVirtually guaranteed unless the government failed that's a good thing and even if you do not live long enough what seems to be a concern of many people to receive is much accrued benefit as if you had taken Social Security at sixty two",

especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe\nLike banks safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know a secret police my house no in a bank states positive box do\nNot signed the ticket not yet what I Want you to do is to photocopy it photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state attorney someone who is expert and experienced in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not wealthy\nAnd left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it and your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have it owned by an L. O. C. limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice you need a lawyer you needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly

dot com we've been talking about the excitement over the mega millions lottery jackpot this week there are a lot of negatives potentially on the lives of lottery winners here's an example of what can happen at your workplace\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always know you're not you know why\nBecause every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful because they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life's not going to change Oh yes it absolutely will you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to\nSatisfy what they believe is how much money you ought to give them so\nIn addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live easily do Google your address not only strangers but\nCrux might come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to\nExtort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the Ritz we were me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change in ways you have never thought possible because you need personal security\nAnd when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute\nHow much money you're going to give your mom you just method after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars I must be given them a million

your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children\nYour grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that's a hundred million dollars guess what\nYou didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars you know my friend knock them you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety two that you did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty\nWe haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change and lifestyle\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for them ain't going to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying the lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars I guess what you'll have won the lottery of course past performances ... future results on your social the country's a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery ticket\nBecause as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one subject\nAren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you win the lottery on Tuesday\nYou saw the stock

B. news radio and then\nCome back to the elements show we invite you to send me your questions by audio and\nThat's exactly what George did here's a question he sent to ask Rick\nAnd Rick element dot com\nI read this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks face this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much an interesting about only pay one or two or three percent but so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of a good\nSo traditionally we what are you don't take any more risk than is necessary to achieve your goals\nBut let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nBut the money into bills call today but think about this when you die who gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids you could argue that that money really isn't yours it's ...\nAnd you are merely the steward of that money you're the custodian your the caretaker of that money\nIf you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that none of taxes and inflation is growing in real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on ...\nAnd if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources\nAnd design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question and if you would like to have this conversation with us you can do so just calls the triple each plan

revenue and within the Dahlia and you could drive and make seven grand a month pretty good income for being a cabdriver and you could sell your medallion\nIf you felt like it became a market where people were\nBuying and selling medallions the value of medallions rose really fast and New York the medallions hit one point three million dollars in value people were getting rich trading medallions\nThen came along over\nNew York city medallions fell from one point three million to a hundred and sixty grand in Philadelphia the medallions fell from half a million dollars to ten grand\nThousands of cab drivers around the country have lost huge amounts of money in San Francisco there has not been a single medallion bought or sold in more than two years which means they're virtually worthless seven hundred drivers bought those medallions the city generated sixty three million dollars in revenue\nA hundred and fifty of those drivers have now the fault it on the loans

after the questions okay we're talking to my he sent\nAnd the question to ask Greg at ... dot com\nIraq this is Mike from Evanston, Illinois I've learned to things from listening to you over the last Twenty years number one I can retire and the custom I'm used to when approximately three percent of my savings will cover my annual expenses\nNumber two thanks to exponential technology middle live longer than ever and probably should plan on having my retirement money last until I'm at least a hundred and Twenty years old\nSo my question is how do I count for inflation in my annual expenses and the calculation of retirement cost I found a a inflation calculator on the Internet she told me if my current monthly expenses and three thousand fifty years from now when I'm only a hundred and ten\nMy monthly cost will be ten thousand dollars\nAnd this is after I've been withdrawing from my savings for fifty years [noise]\nSo do I need three percent of my savings to cover ten thousand dollars given the high likelihood of inflation when it's costing me three thousand dollars now or how do I have very this over time do I need to work longer save more keep my investments in a more aggressive\nMode to cover the costs of inflation that's how we're going to compensate for\nPotentially up to six years of inflation\nMike your right to all three in other words your ear over complicating this a little bit Ah yes inflation will take it's toll overtime but there is nothing new about that inflation is taking and taking its toll overtime for as long as there's been times\nWe all know that everything is more expensive today than it was fifty years ago and everything will be more expensive than it is today fifty years from now so there's nothing new there so\nDon't worry about it in other words history tells us that a diversified investment portfolio earns more over long periods of time than the inflation rate now there's no assurance that that'll be true in the future but that's the basis on which all investment strategies are built there\nIs no reason to believe that won't be true in the future although we can't promise that are guarantee it so on that assumption which is what it is\nYou can assume that your investments will grow over time at a rate faster than the rate of inflation which is how your nest egg in the future will be big enough that when you withdraw three percent or four percent a year from the portfolio it'll produce the income you need even if your income as a whopping ten grand imam\nWhich by the way is the amount of income some people need even today so\nDon't worry about it you were ever complicating but let's shift over to the second half of your question how do you make sure you have enough money so that you can withdraw three percent a year to pay your bills no matter how hot does bills had might happen to be\nUs do you work longer do you save more do you earn higher returns yes yes yes we have to recognize as I've been talking with you about on this program for the past several years and is the basis of my book the truth about your future\nWhich they due to the New York times business bestseller list at number four we have to recognize that the future and what it used to be as Yogi Berra said\nYou're not going to live to eighty five or Ninety or Ninety five chances are you're going to live to one of five one Fifteen one twenty five but you have to recognize that life is going to be much longer due to medical advances and technological innovations that are extending longevity and on that basis\nWe have to recognize that a retirement at age sixty five is probably not realistic for an awful lot of folks\nYou're going to probably have to work longer that doesn't mean you're going to necessarily have to work sixty hours a week making a hundred and fifty grand a year it might be working a few hours a week making ten or twenty grand a year you're going to need to save more than you probably are right now so I Would encourage you if you're not already maximizing your contributions to your retirement plan at work do so\nAdd an extra one percent of your savings rate at work\nAnd make sure you're earning a competitive rate of return make sure that your investment returns are exceeding the inflation rate so that your money is actually growing and real economic terms if inflation is two percent and your bank account is paying one\nYou're losing one percent in real economic terms so we need to make sure that your investments are growing with the pace of the cost of living\nAnd that means you need to make sure that your investments are growing on average over long periods of time not necessarily every single day or week or month or quarter year but over long periods of time on average your overall portfolio was earning a return exceeding vat\nOf inflation and if you will do those three things work a little longer maybe save a little more maybe earn a little bit more maybe

the first time in over twenty five years that the average cost of tuition declined at both public and private colleges are you ready for how much prices fell one hundred dollars\nOr you say we want to get a well okay let's not get terribly excited but look I mean college costs have been rising seven\nPercent per year on average for the past twenty five years according to the College Board and now prices were flat they didn't rise seven percent which means of college was going to cost you twenty five grand\nIt's not twenty five grand one hundred as opposed to seven percent increase of thousands of dollars so this is really very exciting news and demonstrating slow but sure that college is becoming more affordable\nI Believe we're going to see the trend continue we already have colleges that are freezing tuition we have private schools that are offering to charge with public schools pay we have out of state schools charging with in states students pay\nWe have states that are providing free tuition half a dozen of them so far around the country we have companies that are providing free tuition as an Employee Benefit Disney Chrysler gee uh ... uh we have Walmart and\nStarbucks all offering free tuition for employees it's really very exciting it doesn't mean you don't need to be saving for College of course you do the good news is the amount of money that parents have saved for college and college five twenty nine plans has said an all time high of more than three hundred twenty eight billion dollars\n[noise] we spend a lot of money the problem is for forty college\nSavings plans network the average account is only twenty four thousand dollars yeah that's not going to pay for college for your kid and oh by the way less than half of parents who have a child headed to college less than half a parents are saving and a five twenty nine plan so none of the parents were saving\nFor college not enough for setting in the right place and not enough for sending enough money so yeah college costs it looks like they're stabilizing but that's not enough to do the deal so\nUm I Hope you're paying attention to that and I want to share with you the best way to go to

B. news radio and [noise]\nIt's the Rick Edelman show we're talking about the performance of a diversified portfolio this year and the need to remember\nThe long term focus some investors are tempted to try to pick the right investment at the right time but how do you know how to pick the right one\nDo you think you could pick the fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since ... such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year\nGood for you five hundred and Ninety of them in twenty twelve\nOf those five hundred Ninety Gino how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen hundred and forty\nSo off the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty four team only twenty two\nAnd a twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe of Stockton mutual funds of the ... of them that exist\nOver the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen only on\nCBS and the five hundred every year for five years in a row one\nOut of thousands do you think you can pick the funds that are going to outperform the market\nI don't think so what we do is provide passive investment approaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market we're trying to provide the returns of the market minus fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes in inflation so that your money is earning a competitive rate of return which shouldn't be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about beating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight\nIn two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent\nSo if you picked and above average fund a fund that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe you lost thirty two is that like you know any consolation of any kind of [laughter]\nHey you know hey I mean we should be feeling really good we didn't lose thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our money you see my point meaning the markets and that's the goal that's not you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to accomplish\nIs making sure you are long term financial goals and objectives are met and to that end I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class Americans\nForty percent are facing poverty in\nRetirement forty percent nearly three quarters of American workers say that they are going to have to work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money\nSaved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market wrong the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis\nAnd that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return\nIt's not buying a lottery

their end of the bargain when you buy a house you know it takes three months right from the time you sign the contract of the time you close\nIt takes three months you have to do a search to verify the deed right you go to a title company and you've got to make sure that the seller really does own a house that the dean of the house is legitimate\nAnd that title search exists because you don't trust the cellar and so you spend months and you spend thousands of dollars in a title search and you buy\nMortgage insurance you you buy insurance on the deed in case something goes wrong it adds

twenty Eighteen and guess what when a given segment of the stock market starts to perform well especially if it's new and different\nThat's when the fraudsters come out the FCC has now charged an investment fund in Texas with defrauding investments they made false promises of massive returns in cannabis related businesses\nThe FCC says green view investment partners and its founder Michael Cohn\nUsed misleading marketing materials to raise over three million dollars from investors\nThe guy hired sales people to make cold calls were promising twenty four percent annual returns and guess what\nThe guy used an alias to hide prior criminal convictions he lied about having a former agent from the DEA on staff and he lied about having a long term record of profitability by investing in cannabis related businesses\nThe guy in fact actually has no track record the company sold investment of four hundred thousand dollars has yet to produce the single nickel in profits and the guy I guess what you spend investors money on designer clothing and luxury cars yeah somebody got high\nBut it wasn't the investors in fact the only question you can ask the investors about making the restaurant was already on drugs stay away from high fashion sales pitch is based on getting high with investments\nWere taking telephone calls here on the record on the show had not the Dana Point California Bob you're on the air how you doing\nA ... a question or a is actually a market neutral ones my wife or a retired we're in her sixties uh you know I'm a little I Would say I would say not nervous\nBut uh uh uh just concerned about preserving by uh uh what I've accumulated and I started researching these so called war neutral on the four of you know a portion of my portfolio I Would say\nAnd I guess I just wanted to know what your take is on them\nYeah yeah I appreciate the question about\nThe whole name is ... ... of a sales pitch it clearly is titled in a way to appeal to someone who\nAfraid of losing money in the market and therefore they pronounced themselves as market troll ... one of them or if there's not supposed to mean and the first place\nA market neutral fund is by its sales pitch suggesting that they're going to generate a neutrality meaning that if the market goes down there are not going to suffer losses it's going to be neutral\nThat's the stick that's a sales pitch no one has ever been able to really deliver on that kind of a promise a and there's no reason to expect that they're going to be able to deliver on it in the future\nSo rather than trying to choose a sales pitch that his so called market neutral well we would simply opt for instead is diversification\nIn other words don't put all of your money into stocks have some of your money there to give you some opportunity to keep pace with the cost of living but don't put all of your money there instead have some of your money and bonds and you have some of your money under the mattress having some of your money in cash\nA does make perfect sense we don't have all of our money in any one place but having a little bit of our money in lots of places makes sense so not just stocks but also bombs in foreign securities and government security is an oil and gas and real estate in exponential technologies\nAnd on and on and on so that is what we have found to be the best approach or effectively frozen another way it's not the best approach\nIt's the least worst approach um because what we have really found it's kinda like democracy right the worst political system ever devised except for all the others and it's similar to the same thing we don't know what is\nBest way to invest so we choose the least worst which is not making big bats so if you'll simply place a little bit of your money in a large array of investment opportunities you can help insulate yourself\nFrom losing a lot of money at any one time in any one asset class because you don't have all their money in any one after class so that makes sense for it\nThey said yes totally makes sense and uh you know thank you for talking the out of it uh because it didn't make sense to the\nMany time

market\nI wouldn't I don't think you would either because although the stock market has been historically the best performing asset class we also know it's a very volatile outside class remember two thousand eight\nOf course you do and that's the problem is that we don't want to expose ourselves to the possibility of suffering\nMassive losses in a very rapid pace and that's why you only have part

market\nBecause the more diversified my portfolio is no worse it's been doing relative to the stock market because it's been the u._s. stock market that has been out performing everything else\nOf course that's what they were saying up until Wednesday on Wednesday everybody started changing their tune to\nBoy am I really glad I don't have all of my money and the stock market boy I'm really glad I have a highly diversified portfolio boy am I glad I have money and investments other than\nThe stock market see my point in other words just because the given asset classes performing well and even might be performing better than alternatives doesn't mean that you ditch the alternatives\nAt any given moment fortunes can change as we saw was striking evidence on Wednesday and Thursday when the Dow fell Thirteen hundred points this is why you don't place all your money into stocks\nAnd it even goes beyond that because what Wednesday and Thursday demonstrated for us was something else that's

trees\nIs ... ... it was raining and so [noise]\nIt's the Rick Edelman show even talking about the need to keep perspective in markets in days like these and we've been talking about gee for a few times throughout the year because this company which was at one point one of the biggest companies in America\nAnd one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years the stock was down forty\nPercent over the past year GE he was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year wow really awful so far this year\nGee is still in the U.S and the five hundred but its stock performance in the U.S and the five hundred year to date through Tuesday\nRanked at the four hundred Ninety six best stock yeah out of the five hundred that came in at four hundred and Ninety six only for stocks were worse than gee\nYou're the date but as of Wednesday for the past week jeeze stock performance is now number one [laughter]\n\nIn other words nobody wanted to own Ga all year long because of all the terrible things that have been happening in that company but suddenly with the stock market dropping so much on Wednesday compared to everything else gee did fabulous and became the number one performing stock for the week through\nTuesday of this past week I mean this is why you really can't try to decide what's gonna happen next because you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't just the G anyone from among the worst to the very best for the weekend and Tuesday\nIf you look at what's been going on in all of the death filed the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the S. and P. five hundred were advanced micro devices\nA bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year but now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectively\nThey went from being the three best\nTo for the past week as a third Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just a suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument a reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio based on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus\nOn those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed\nIf your attitude about risk has not changed than there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not in and of itself enough of a reason to make a change in the portfolio now I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued volatility in the market my point is very simply\nWe can't draw a conclusion one way or the other nor should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this country since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still hunting along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're seeing stopped watching them lose\nIt doesn't mean you should change your investments that means you should change much at all that's the most effective advice I can give you on the show today there is something that I think you do want to do and I'm Talking to you gentleman who are listening to the program right now\nYou know it it's really fascinating people are fixated on what's happening in the stock market this past week due to the volatility of the markets what you really need to be paying attention to is what's going on in the bond market according to the Bloomberg Barclays multi verse index this is an index of\nAll bonds all around the world they fell in value by about a trillion dollars this past week [noise]\nA trillion dollars why because the fed is raising interest rates as\nInterest rates go up the value of bonds goes down so here's what I find rather ironic I'm almost comical people who are upset about the stock market saying oh my goodness I'm fearful of losing money in stocks I think I'll run the bonds for safety only to have their money go down in the bond market because rising rates are causing bond values to fall\nBack to work tomorrow mostly cloudy with scattered showers highest sixty three Tuesday and

heading out to Troy, Michigan holes on the line you know involved [noise]\nAnd my question is about the\nOption of taking a a lump sum pension reform and given the opportunity to take on it and wanted your input on it\nUh the question is whether you take the lump sum\nA or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter] so that's a yeah it's like there's no reduced though do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing for a lot of folks\nThe good news is this it is\nStraight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis versus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective uh more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true of great or stretching our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases this year they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where were the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually them are clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions of a fixed amount\nWhatever they are giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise with the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or a partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nAh so that's a consideration ah that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one his lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you\nWhereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce it you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum

terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you you are correct a tariff is essentially attacks\nIt's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S\nAnd it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured provided product or service instead so yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government coffers um\nIt's really that simple foreign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch the other governments throw equal punches and are there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government and taxes which is good news right we've got a massive deficit right the government is spending more money than it is receiving this helps to solve that problem\nBut uh the burden is paid by American consumers

A. dot com\nBubble he really it was raining and\nYou're listening to work out on the show we talk a lot here on the program of coming Social Security crisis in court and said we'd get Congress to take action now to help us\nFurther this conversation I'm very excited to bring on the program Alicia Munnell shoes the Peter after ... professor of management sciences at Boston College is terrible school of management and more to my heart she's the director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research that might not sound like a big deal you but in our circles in the financial planning world\nThe Boston College Center for Retirement Research produces some of the most important data are useful in the financial planning world so which I'm really excited to have you with us on the program today\nOh I'm delighted to be here and I like your endorsement\nAlicia is a a former member of the president's council of economic advisor she was former assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy um so how is the retirement outlook these days for today's workers\nIt it's not good Rick I'm we calculate an index it shows about fifty percent of today's working how falls are not going to be able to maintain their standard of living once I stop working\nWell that's not very exciting and ... is the situation been this way for a long time or has the landscape changed in recent decades\nUm the landscape has changed a lot in recent decades has gotten a particularly a worst since the financial crisis\nMean to some stew though may\nWhy what we should ask why we lost a lot of money in two thousand eight and a lot of house values and those items haven't totally returned\nWell wait a minute hang on I mean if you sat through two thousand eight and took no action I mean the stock market back then was at fourteen thousand before the crisis\nUh today the Dallas pushing twenty five thousand housing prices back you know seven weren't as high as they are today in major markets so shouldn't people actually be better off today now that we've had an extra ten years of savings on top of it and yet you're saying that's not really true in a lot of cases\nSo that's a sharp and the stock market the people hold stocks or the people in the high income so if you look at the top third and yes they have equity holdings and they have um their stock values have gained in\nTheir stocks have gained it value but for the bottom two thirds of households they really don't hold very much stocks and I think the housing a story is yes for almost back to where it was our our most recent data trick two thousand sixteen and hadn't quite gotten back to the off\nPeak of the bubble a by two thousand sixteen but the house values are really high on the coach as you know in Boston New York and California and and not so high in between and not even high in all parts of California\nAnd this is I think the point that a lot of folks really don't fully comprehend them and we see this every day in our financial planning practice that\nAlthough it's true that people who own stocks and oh seven had they held through today there'd be a lot better off\nThe first factors you pointed out as most people didn't own stocks at all second those many of those who did hold stocks and those southern panicked and nine sold at the low or near it and so they're kind of frozen in time there are ... are pretty much were they were even though we're ten years later they haven't\nEnjoy the run up in value because they didn't hold onto their investments are having continue to add to their investments and so they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nThat that's right and it's and it's a lot of people lost their jobs ... uh two thousand seven in two thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't panicked events just demanded that they withdraw the money the level of marriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments\nSo that means people are now in a conundrum because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that's forcing people to work longer but is that as viable or an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm a great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and it has a huge impact on their wellbeing a in retirement\nSo we've got the issue that people in order to improve their situation and generate income for themselves that they won't outlive as one key working longer the longer
