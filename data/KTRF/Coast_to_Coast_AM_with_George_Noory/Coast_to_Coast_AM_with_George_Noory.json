massive compendium he put together the titles says it all the monster book he's got every monster you can imagine not Hollywood versions although some of them the Hollywood versions are based on the real things\nYou know I think the the idea of extinctions that might actually not be extinct could actually I applied to a number of these so called trip to says that cold\nAnd then you get into some real weird ones and ballet and he'll in books like that and written about commonalities with these creatures though yeah maybe ills and troll that were reported long ago are now being reported ETs or aliens and it\nMay be the same beings that are in different forms are seen through a different culture in prison where you come down on that\nWell yeah I mean I'm a big I'm sort of follower of of John ... would particularly and I think one of the things for me at least I mean I've you know different people get difference you know responses from from reading his books\nBut from my perspective I I kind of type the view that is most important um [noise] revelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be\nMulti connected if you like to connected and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big foot type creatures on in the same location and timeframe a site for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia or in the sixties\nUm when they were ... when they come off from a sane soaring around the the skies both both point pleasant he also had a lot of cancers with men in black and you were following cancer so I think some of these creatures that like some of the the we're the ones like my mom and the dog men and things like that I think\nI'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of\nCrypto zoology little creature say can cause I'm not entirely sure that they are creatures are animals in the way we understand it\nUm you know when you get reports of say a big foot vanishing in a flash of light or you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think that we're dealing with something that's perceived as an animal\nThat night may not they I don't think Kael was I'm someone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people just didn't they just turn their heads they just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle in vale with the the way the site of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got wolf men go ugh men are we're ... we're cats sheep chapters are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities\nUm or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into\nA Web well from a regular person you know that\nOf all the the Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs um I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never got to reports\nOf someone you know literally shape shift the like in you know American we have all the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that it's the\nCases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThey the locations where they dug men type creatures said is intriguing very often these\nAncient burial ... I'm Native American land um some of the ... the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing Bob and just seeing that random\nYou had one a werewolf case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times you remember that yes\nYou know this was um at a British a bicycle royal Airforce help to break and they're actually he was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was I'm\nActually an American guy but it's working out of his age or you can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had I'm an American presence fishers hiked the Cold War\nAnd he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in hair\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot taught trade show was it not put five but just faith a face was very different\nTo hire you were describing nights and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of a big football day\nWith a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um [noise] you know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like federal fabricated story like that he was um\nI was able to confess I mean it's a background in the mail a tray and he said he just wanted to share the story because he never forgotten about it and it was so if\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report these huge dogs I mean right on a pound or the ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats and that you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal to skate from the zoo or maybe if somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the uh the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the dog when\n[noise] well yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what I noticed find some black dogs now I'm Conan off of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel harm to the ... he actually face his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um that typically a much ... much larger than regular dogs a base fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the elections and traditions if he were to say one of these um find some black dog see what are the main that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nI'm I'm ... and like the dog my entire often sane at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several um reports of people saying to find some black dogs in the vicinity\nOf stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gum the next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what these things are you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all eyes the spirits of dogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirits of of that dogs that I Would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm ...\nAnd then the cats are even harder to explain to the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there and well now you write\nIn fact they become known as ... I Am big cats\nAnd I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now\nThe occasional sort of ask guy\nAs sky pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases and you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a sky from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is\nThere are these large black cats roaming around the U. K. which simply\nDefy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of his top of Scotland these hundreds every now\nFor that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is if they offer flesh and blood regular animals which not every research with the phenomenon thinks that's the case you\nKnow what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about who's the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween AC DC hell's bells we're right back\n[noise] [noise] do you want your TV show beyond belief with George ... simply go do beyond belief dot com\nMm Mm\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect than there were there\nWere a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise] but it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's all ready notorious for sightings of things\nEnough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven services at a window of all places in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's really creepy story and I guess appropriate for um Halloween I miss a story a given to me by a lady named Terri and she had the same time to a Nineteen Seventy seven with what I can only call like amount in black\nNot many black as that portray bar Will Smith and tell me late Jones in the movies but the real men in black and much weight of a sort of very pile and skiing a\nAnd don't look entirely humans I sort of almost ... ... ... like a lot of paranormal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know whereas in the movies that some secret agents you know of a sacred agency\nBut Terry told me the story of times Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time\nShe was having lunch with a friend and this creeping mining black time towards them sat down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically the the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy\nAnd she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like demonic was ... I was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating eyes this old black suits and just gave off this really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nAnd didn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she got a lot of tragedy in a life and he kind of\nFull capacity that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset or things said I'm going to come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the ... men stories at least the movie version of more men is that this creature up years\nDifferent forms the different people at different times but it's a harbinger of doomed to come and it predates a bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you'd think it plays out in the ... men so I think the point pleasant and beyond\n[noise] well yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it sort of saturated in witness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia I when people started seeing this\nCreature that some people described as like a flying humanoid\nA few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act to others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I was saying something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of weird a UFO activity um the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injury cold it was like approach how men in black and also a lot of other amyloid they unconscious and also reports\nOf women and black turning up and threatening a UFO witnesses on the highlights of it of course you know you have the specter of the month month flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called ... or as he was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a point pleasant someone side of the Ohio River in Ohio it was on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal and various race such as um addressed the the connection or the potential connection between the presence of the ... on\nOn the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have there was really sort of two overriding ferries one but my mom\nAmy the cause of the disaster in the ... all that it was sort of a a warning and to tell you that in ... in its own strange way try to warn people of looming um disasters and bad luck\nAnd that's still very much divides people did buy it upon you know to this day but um but it's also an English equivalent to all be known as the owl mind which also has a sort of penetrating red eyes and large wings into a humanoid form\nAnd a friend of mine John diamonds who's looked into this case deeply\nJohn eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the race or any investigation they all my stories about things would happen to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just stop it started doing the research that he realized from his perspective but it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over him every time he got into he said he quite literally\n... eventually said I'm done you know I'm I'm staying away from it because he felt somehow it was getting these clothes ain't team\nWe had a resurgence of interest in more men in recent times in the Chicago area a lot of reports of people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking on the part of people who follow this stuff and we should what happened\nWishful thinking on the part of people who follow this sort of stop and we should what happened or whether there's some credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creature waves in the field of crypto zoology\nYou know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... in Chicago last summer um and we get kind of spite so or waves of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania\nUm there was sudden spots an outbreaks of big activity um some of these like bumps the stories you know that they won't be any side seems for years and then suddenly those you know a two week period\nWe get a lot of things like that and um that kind of um on glee feel like he's sort of paralleled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection\nBetween these creatures even though they perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that way of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interesting now from my perspective though I didn't really investigate the ... sign things because um there are a lot of people\nUm who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaving two and a lot of good\nResearch into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about it\nAnd it ... to have a number of witnesses to them off in Chicago had suddenly afterwards had almost as ice or prevented dreams of nightmares of nuclear destruction and um [noise]\nAtomic mushroom clouds and you know the end of civilization and I actually had somebody in the ... region of close to the tea papal respond to that article um who many of them living in the Chicago area who felt that um you know something might happen\nOr others I had these\nI continue um dreams and nightmares of atomic war in the United states and um\nAnd I felt somehow that he was connected with our sightings of this my last month type creature so in that sense you know that was that was kind of a disturbing situation you know to get old days nuclear\nNightmares as I told him you know from people saying these strange creatures was was kind of you know be disturbing\nUm you know I think you're you're careful not to take too strong of a position in defense of some of these cases\nAre both occasionally you will make a comment that let your readers know where you are on that you will respond to critics who try to just brush it off and I I Know you have to be careful you don't want to commit to these things because you know it's hard it's hard to

abduction case in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes government surveillance to all different level so that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean they the conventional aspect\nIf you can call it a conventional um aspect to the story goes back to the fifties and it's a famous case\nUh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio village ... claim to be taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with this beautiful looking um alien woman\nAnd um and for all kinds of purpose if he was taken on board against these will so he was\nAbducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know he saw the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Sonia villa suppose all you know it was a really weird aspect of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspect to the story or which places an entirely different\nSlant on it until now if you read carefully Antonio ... says a report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO research or an adult to nine to ... um he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down and he started to feel way it is if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast and he was making a Beijing noise that's kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape they the spinning disk on top of the roses and debating noise\nSays like the classics and you get with a helicopter now a mine came\nForward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's still didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a race a year for research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um\nThe the abduction was a fabrication and that's going but he really did evolve a helicopter\nBut they targeted um Bayliss Bowers he was out to the ... lights at night\nAnd they release some sort of aerosol illusion to Jenike aerosol a witch incapacitated in Tokyo on board the helicopter and the the woman was really there and the power was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to states\nI doubt um but he is in that sort of at all to state wasn't sure what was going on and that was sort of ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd they the favorite of the story was but they\n... agencies within ... that might well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad my mission with the fifties while the\nCIA eyes and ... and things like they the plan was to try and determine to what extent they human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say I only and we can convince them and anything\nThat was basically what it came down to so metal ... which claimed that um\n[noise] but they they the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd buy kind of just then sat back and white hate to say how much of the story was taken and when I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was apparent books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets think that that it's something beyond just some alien presidents that there's military or government involvement yeah I mean they should\nWhere it gets confusing if that you know throughout January and I didn't have adoptions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and they use the UFO and go as the ... to try and you know um to see how it works on paper doesn't work\nSo you know it gets really confusing when the cookie rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both than just not telling us\nWell I think there's good evidence that it's ah it's actually both because it's so many abduct taste that I spoke with said that they are a number of occasions I'd actually paying visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a\nA traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more but based military personnel were actually approaching the abduct pace quietly\nRequesting that they didn't talk about their experiences and some of Dayton and some of them have but they basically they ... it was as if the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why they should be done so in other words they were trying to get to the heart of what the abductions where why that would be done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um ... they have to pay a good example\nAnd somebody um it was tied to coast to coast Greg bishops I'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay the correspondence and the Nineteen nineties a duck to college or who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself\nAnd Greg told me how you know back in the early\nNineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of a ... I wrote to each other back and forth were open and sailed back down with type\nAnd I'm now they can clearly be done you know aids away without making it looked like the ... I was taught to open a race failed it was almost as if\nWhoever was doing base wants to Greg and college and it's a no that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of luck and intimidation hey you know we're watching it and that went on you know for for quite a period\nOf ... working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know um are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an alien abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know\nAnd which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I I think many papers so Shiite them with capital the education's\nI'll tell you what were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side or save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons five Nineteen Seventy one\nJoined the ... stage with thousands of members bits Greek for show updates and to the men's ... dot com slash ... him including ... [noise]\nOne of the things such as being notice and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these\nWhoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that operates outside of government you know it may actually\nIt may sort of do research and work for the governments\nBut it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that ... I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program\nDesigned to do the work and in most papers and government don't know anything about it at all because he might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government itself you know it might have been even\nSort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more\nDifficult to get material for the fate of Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by\nAh by the frame information request so in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and an ... helicopters turning up near the homes sometime precariously near the homes I bailing out duct tape and and again kind of light with college entering Greg\nThey might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abductees 'em and be able to to respond at that high speed if in in the\nEvent that base that the people flying ... were actually able to\nCatch an abduction going ahead you know in the ... very time\nSomebody who's the tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions Kevin relations black helicopters and we're saying yeah this happens but the files that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies in government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why does stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nPaint the information to themselves unless it leads to be shed and if we daily with as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um\nOn the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages I'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations I'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... and\nI'm bored of the United states and in the latter part to Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs\nIn Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas so I think we're seeing a pot and and then I think the violence and intimidation of sort of the the mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented cases it's tough to figure it out and it's hard to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up Bob ... in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there is a film coming out about those are it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the germ because those guys coming out in December and then there's a book\nThat's going to be published I think after the first year and a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[laughter] well yeah I mean you know ... story is always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you add rides but one of the things I've always found about ... saw is unlike a lot of people who hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out of fuel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know they are and I think that the big difference we'd lives off is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was he's never expanded on it if he tells the same stories a Thirty Years' ago\nHe's hardly tried to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and however many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't\nYou know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story he doesn't come across like your average hope so [noise] so that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nBetween the abductions and paypal who claimed that in some way or another they\nThe the grace of the aisle and grays new to the abductions\nThat somehow they have this deep and sort of sinister and disturbing interest in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and ask for this\nThis portion of area fifty while he was working at allegedly and um\nHe said that was the aliens or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um and he speculates on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the graves had some sort of obsessive interesting\nIn the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed dastardly by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you bought a veal salt leaving your body\nUm did you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of the of child wave this story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general and and of course we've been told in Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military\nAnd all and then of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project ... book they're not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it\nAnd now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned the last ten months that wasn't true but there were ongoing studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably as ridiculous topic\nUm in light of the kind of files that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOr do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner wary of this you know they say there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know this this angle of um rail abductions fabricated abductions the violence\nThe government itself trying to get its had around what's going on you know you put all this together and um [noise]\nYou know ... it really is sort of a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know when uh the way I've written the book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAnd abduction events but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um\nYou know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but there but there is no doubt at all that you know that there is sort of extensive um survivors of abductees\nYeah that's right now the X. files everything is great nothing black and white I'm ... we'll take one or two calls or east of the Rockies uh John and Virginia Hi John you're on Nicorette burn\nYour genetic thanks for taking my

that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of the audience and part of string theory\nBut sure\nUm use me so yes there's string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern government the universe\nTheir string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics and the problem is that\nWe have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets of equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together we have\nWe we have we had a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and um that Governor governor subatomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum\nAnd we know those equations work we know they're correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum of the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and San I'm a ...\nA series of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorist and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the ... version and the ... version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which a scientist and struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know they're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together and\nThey're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange and uncanny on implications of of quantum physics\nThat um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well write the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who\nWho have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or somehow related to some some concepts in physics\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah ... is a great little book um so ... kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four\nHas quite a cultural lights and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flat land as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in uh the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nYeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time um you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing the ... wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um embedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe but habits\nFlat world was that was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's complete\nThis you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat\nAnd it's populated by two dimensional objects this object which just linked with some of them were flat square some of them were but circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they lived in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when\nA three dimensional object a sphere inserts itself goes down in in ... in search itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks out on his his ... sees the appearance of this mysterious object he starts talking to 'em and\n[noise] the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another\nAnother world and the square says this can't be possible\nAnd the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is better than a larger world so the sphere\nRegards to a more um extreme measure and he he reaches over and pull the square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and of course the\nThan the square looks around and look down on his flat world that can\nFor the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them so that's where it becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension but there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to flat world of course and it's pretty enthusiastic about this I Can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in ... and it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of the higher mentioned so he has put in jail where he\nWhere he stays for a number of your ears and and the story ends with us for flat square languishing in prison I'm hoping that the his readers ... from the readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of\nLike the idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension I mean a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interesting comment on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts but up at the square character did have these wild often and even at the stationary experience right where his father that was that there was another space or direction to reality and I'm\nSo happy ever wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to [noise] you know think about the possibility that above hours three spaces are three spatial dimensions that might be others um that we don't see we go through our life\nUm you know thinking about our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the multi bars\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] I'm like I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment uh we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors break on through take us into the break\n[noise]\nTo find out where George ... speaking go to the coast to coast am dot com website scroll down to the bottom and clip your just humid or\n\n\n\nSeasons\nChange you know\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure\nAbout anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move and I think not a lot of people would make All right and the situation as he he raises map addict and geometry as a kind of a and he kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing but there's a way in which the map provide hurting the um to him I think is his\nStory a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nI must say in the book he developed the whole way of thinking\nAbout higher spatial dimensions and he is very\nWhole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he he starts to think you know what if these these mathematical variables and my question you know these higher these higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence\nSomehow um you know what if the math points up to the real existence of these kinds of spaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops\nOf way of what he thought of as a sort of ... educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this into the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses that involves um new it involves instead of twenty seven cubes that are labeled\nA all twenty seven are labeled and stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube\nYou know that's three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll ah and then he'll rotate the Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative um exercise\nBut he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues sort of shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um\nAnd doing your research but instead he he was doing things like\nPutting this this uh this cue these cubes sets together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and\nHe actually he actually also invented a pitching gotten which was one of the first um um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter] he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document in trades I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a free and mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto what do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife for heaven and so on and so\nI'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise] you know the writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people in the U.S and then\nIn Europe take these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book\nChapter seven chapter eight is is cs\nLewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis are learning the same famous\nBritish a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas around there as well he's got\nHe's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he\nHe was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war and become disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James Bennett and\nI'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings sort of have an ear and out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talked about in chapter six um which is a chapter\nReally about dreams that seemed to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimension how that might help explain what happened to him\nUm well let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else higher reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah the drinks are fascinating and um your dreams or seemed to be important and just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like this with psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who is is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and\nSo you have a people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams\nAnd in my book uh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the\nThe spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book\nUh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British aeronautical engineer also was soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twenty century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too and he starts to have dreams that\nI'm not surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams\nAre then seem to happen in real life so he has he has predicted dreams or ... what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future and these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin\nIn as he's camped out uh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wandered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In the battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happens you would have dreams and then you wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so what one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book he has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking\nThis book he has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean he's obviously on an island\nHe recognizes the island as someplace he's already been into streams you notice is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gaffe um that the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French but he's panicked and he's\nHe's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something is going to go wrong he knows who's going to be a volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French they don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believes him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nAnd then a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island of Martinique the French speaking island of Martinique\n'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um and some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think how could this be how could how could in in my dreams how could I have seen an event that hasn't happened\nAnd he he keeps it to themselves for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his you can Google him Che W done and\nYou can go go in and check out his airplane design says his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it as as the country's headed towards a World War one but he he tries to reflect on this he's puzzled by these dream he's worried about them he started writing them down and then he he\nHe comes across basically of the\nLike people like in ten and people who are talking about the possibility that there is\nHigher dimensions and he's reading Einstein well he's reading about Einstein history and sort of popular science and he he ended up developing a theory\nExercise and healthy eating can help reverse pre diabetes start taking a simple

D. priest leaves I'm asked Christopher here\nIf you've ever read the pre sleeves a sort of a big essay on um it's called man in time it was published along with a with a lot of young books as out of the wonderful book at the great bucks\nYeah yeah oh oh good so you haven't read it well very good well I think you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues I been happening is that is with the I guess with the system particularly you seem to still be attached I guess in the anthropology of physics it never really\nExamine they're that they're sort of preconceived their prejudices that come from their priest or this is why I suppose\nUh uh toward a about time about the issue is a time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how it can be even a fundamental dimension of our ah reality and then I also the whole perception or not just this time but uh I mean\nI I when I look at things in a quantum level we see that everything is everything is is a sort of waves\nAnd I mean of course people don't even have waves are frequencies are but but time becomes very essential 'cause it gets the existence of matter that you do an art project or a perception of it anyway so I mean they're just ... anyway you have any comments or thought about the\nThank you Charles appreciate the call\nYeah that's that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book I'm Jamie briefly I talked about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright\nTwentieth century and BBC broadcaster he gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions um he reads a hint and who we talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about um and he comes up and developed his own theories\nInterestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one and a young person and as um as an adventure\nUm and he also has some he also has some unique experiences of\nFeeling like he's out of time I'm feeling like he's out of the body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time\nUm and in the book he has all kinds of testimonials from people who have written to him about their pre cognitive dreams either dreams that seem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nIn Nineteen sixty two sixty three can't remember and he he asked the the viewing audience to writing letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience I've ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and uh he got over Fifteen hundred letters um from\nFrom the from the viewing audience the let many of the letters are still extent this still at the\nUniversity of Bradford I'd been there to read through all the letters and I I incorporate\nA number of time in my book especially will be a Christopher white will take a break we are talking about other worlds with Chris white and Tom Petty takes us into the break we'll get to more of your calls and questions minimum\nDuring the ... the sports page with thousands of members is great for show updates in connecting with other means ... ... ... am including like but [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um [noise]\nYeah so that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nUh Marcia I just wrote it down I'm going to give that a try thanks for the suggestion taller than reading from the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\nWhat happened to me is I uh I started writing the ... of a dream journal and I I wrote a dream that my mother's husband who was that was going to give me his car and almost some money so [noise]\nDidn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now driving his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that a dream I wrote it down with them with the date on it and everything and it came true like months later [noise]\n[noise] yeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that GW done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like you did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream you get up you write it down right away and and um people hold journalism and think about your dreams and\nHe believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses um glimpses into the future and their dreams so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard line Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\nGood to good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I\nThought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote viewing remote viewing has it's drawbacks this is um this is a mental or is this a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel the cool super conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds for different reasons whether it's hailing whether it's neat a loved one or for other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different things how they're doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is that it's not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a trans state and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it will start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um [noise] you know sometimes the way that people talk about higher dimensions as a as a\nAs a dimension of consciousness right ... and you definitely have the\nTwentieth century psychologist and Carl young and many others um you know when we talk about that are being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well it's going in you know it's not going out somewhere it's going to end that consciousness sort of um occupies this this\nStarted a new direction um and yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is\nPossible to to access those those dimensions um you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a\nRight into the zone where you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences while meditating it's much more much more mundane unfortunately but um\nBut I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices um sounds like what you do\nThanks joke for the call you know you read about the musicians and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue McCartney has written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his head yeah uh or or other songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and talked to scientists about scientific creativity and scientific convention and many times as well have the same kind of stories\nSome of them will talk about dreams some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from some of them will talk about different there's ... there's different layers of consciousness um so I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning Gordon wildcard mind your own with Chris white\nGeorge ... uh I don't think I've ever called in the year so I I usually call in

I'm a Christian that whole to the um Enron and the Eighteen prohibition against us on collecting the spirit world but not contact and\nThen I had a theory that in most cases and and ... I wanted to ask your opinion whether the up and you saw the video up there on on a they your post first time I think that they may be even magnet to make that pops up a pencil or pen shop around but\nI also think it's possible that there are genuine the angels uh parents which\nMay may actual I don't think it's likely spirit but a kidney or maybe extra crossroads eating from another dimension and somehow hold in most cases the dean on our mouth rating\nAnd you have an Eighteen buttons very maybe Eighteen so I'm a stay on the line in case you want to ask you a question or something because this was pretty deep\nWell that's a lot on their Gordon let's let's get her take on some of that\nYeah there there's a lot there\nThere is a lot there and there's a you know there's a whole all of the\nUh all of the science fiction literature and um and even alien abduction literature uses that language of other dimensions right that that these that these beans\nCame from another dimension I'm so there definitely is a lot of that in my book and there's a lot of American Pop culture about um other dimensional or other dimensional beings um you also raise the question of you\nKnow what is the relationship of UFOs and extra traditional classroom beings to ghosts and spirits or demons and that that's also a question that people raise 'em and I'm not sure I'd be able to shed any additional light on that I I Know that\nFrom just some of my reading and and not literature\nAnd here I'm thinking of like ... I don't know if you know ...\nStuff on on communion or he actually has a new book I'm I'm On the subject as well but he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what's the relationship is between\nAlien abduction and extraterrestrials on the one hand versus um spirits and go on the other so he I think Whitley it's come to come to believe that there's there's a connection on and it sounds like you've come to believe that as well that there's a\nThere's a connection somehow you know maybe departed spirits hum are aliens or aliens are depart spirits\nAnd do we think we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program or Chris and looking for his actions and you'd be amazed how many scientists or\nA behind the scenes are interested in those kinds of subjects as well whether there's a connection yeah looking at the idea of the universe the many worlds theory and you talk about it in your book of course that wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out we're just about any of them to accept the now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't that crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean yeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about a a world or a universe with many worlds right I mean you mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multiverse\nIdea right the multiverse ideas that there's you know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and\nYou know I um I Believe now that that's a that's a very mainstream I'm I prefer to conventional wisdom now among cosmologist and theoretical physicists that that there is a multi birth you know which is um and that's another fantastic scientific concept that there's not proof for\nThere's really not proof of that idea but it it is it has become a kind of an appealing idea to scientists\nAnd then you mentioned the sort of\nMany infinite parallel universes of many worlds theory or the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics another idea that we live in a complex and constantly branching universe\nWhere there's multiple copies infinite copies of all of us doing all kinds of other things right and in parallel world so I I Do try to introduce some of those other theories on towards the end of the book as well but it's it's an

'cause I'm not entirely sure they are creatures are animals in the way we understand it\nUm you know when you get reports of say a big foot by Michigan a flash of light or you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think that we daily with something that's perceived as an animal\nThat night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm\nSomeone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people just didn't they just turn their heads they just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the way the side of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are we're ... we're cats sheep gestures are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities\nUm or ... or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a Web well from a regular person you know that sort of all the\nThe Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs um I've got a lot of I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gone to reports\nOf someone you know literally shape shift the liking Americans have all the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThese cases that I Do have what I found is that\nThey the locations where they dug man type creatures have said is in trade it very often these\nAncient burial Maryland's I'm Native American land um some of the ... the mysterious mounds in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one a werewolf case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times you remember that yes\nYeah they saw some other British a bicycle royal Airforce ... and uh actually it was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was I'm\nActually an American guy but it's working a Elvis age have already come right in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had I'm an American presence there was a hike to the Cold War\nAnd he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ... and ... sort of kind of look like a big foot ... was it not for five but just face to face was very different\nTo hire you were describing nights and it was more like a long muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine took a big party\nWith the with the German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um you know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like that'll fabricated story like that he was um\nI was able to confess I mean it's a background in the mail a tray and he said he just wanted to share the story because he never forgotten about it and it was so it\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report these huge dogs I mean right out of town to the ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats and the you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the zoo or maybe in somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the development\n[noise] well yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what I noticed find some black dogs now\nI'm Conan off of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel harm to the basket veils he actually face his novel on a pre existing legend I'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k.\nUm that typically are much ... much larger than regular dogs on my face fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the elections and traditions if he were to say one of these um find some black dogs would automate that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nI'm I'm at and light that dog my entire often seen at the same places like um crossroads graveyards I'm Pisces like that in moderation is I've got several um reports of people saying the find some black dogs in the vicinity\nOf stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second but then what literally gum and next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what these things are you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all the ice the spirits of dogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine a fight with the\nSpirits of of that dogs they would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm\n... and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there and well now you\nWrite in fact they become known as ... face I Am big cats\nAnd I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now\nThe occasional sort of ask I\nAsk I pay you know from a zoo menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases and you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a sky from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly\nThe problem is there are these large black cats roaming around the U. K. which simply\nDefy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of his top of Scotland these hundreds every now\nFor that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is a ... a flesh and blood regular animals which not every research with the phenomenon thinks that's the case\nYou know what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about who's the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween a CD the hell's bells we'll be right back\n[noise] do you want your TV show beyond belief with George Nouri simply go to beyond belief dot com\nMm Mm\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press and one of them even spoke to the local police or the [laughter] I don't really know what the police could have done about it but it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that's you know you have the spice of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story or in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven services and the windshield of all places in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's a really creepy story and I guess appropriate for um Halloween I miss a story a given to me by a lady named Terri and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with what I can only call like I'm Out in black\nAnd not the men in black has that been portrayed by Will Smith and told me lead Jones in the movies\nBut the rail men in black and much weight and that sort of very ... and eight\nAnd don't and look entirely human they sort of almost look ... found pile like I Know a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies ... secret agents of a sacred agency but Terry telling me the story of hands Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time\nShe was having lunch with a friend and this creeping manning black time tours and sat down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm\nBasically to the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy\nAnd she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like the money was ... was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of ... old black suits and just gave off these really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the things that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she got a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFull costume that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never re forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat they said we'll things said I'm going to come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for summer\nYou know the man stories and at least the movie version of more men is that this creature up years\nDifferent forms to different people different times but as a harbinger of doomed come than it predates a bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you think it ... it plays out in the ... men so I think the point pleasant and beyond\n[noise] well yeah I mean there's no doubt that it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it's sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started seeing this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid\nA few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act till others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of we had a UFO activity um the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injury cold it was like approach how money in black and also a lot of of the amyloid band cancers and also reports\nOf women and black turning up and threatening a UFO witnesses on the heights of it of course you know you have the specter of the month month flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called the or as he was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a point pleasant someone side of the Ohio River an Ohio it was on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal and various race such as um addressed the the connection or the potential connection between the presence of the ... on\nOn the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have there was really sort of two overriding ferries one but my mom\nThat caused the disaster the deaths all that it was sort of um a warning and to tell you that in ... in its own strange way try to warn people of looming um disasters and an ... look\nI'm that's still very much divides people divided upon you know to this day but um but it's also an English equivalent to all be known as the our mind which also has a sort of penetrating red eyes and large wings in a a humanoid form\nAnd a friend of mine John diamonds who's looked into this case deeply John eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the\nRace or any investigation they all my stories about things that happened to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just after he started doing the research that he realized from his perspective\nBut it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over him every time he got into he said he quite literally ... eventually said I'm done you know I'm I'm staying away from it because he felt somehow it was getting these close maintain\nA resurgence of interest in more men in recent times in the Chicago area a lot of reports of people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking the part of the people who follow this sort of stop and we should what happened or\nThere it is wishful thinking on the part of people who follow this sort of stop and we should what happened or whether there's some credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange\nCreature waves in the field of crypto zoology\nYou know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... in Chicago last summer um and we get kind of spite so or waves of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania\nUm there were certain spots and outbreaks of big activity um some of these like bumps the stories you know that they won't be any side things for years and then suddenly those you know a two week period\nAnd we get a lot of things like that and um that kind of I'm I'm really feel like he's sort of power leveled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection\nBetween these creatures even though they perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that way of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interested\nNow from my perspective although I didn't really investigate the ... sign things because um there are a lot of people um who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaping two and a lot of good research into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about it\nAnd it ... to have a number of witnesses to them off in Chicago had suddenly afterwards had almost as ice or prevented dreams of nightmares of nuclear destruction and um [noise]\nAtomic mushroom clouds and you know the end of civilization and I actually had somebody in the ... region of close to the tea papal respond to that article um who many of them living in the Chicago area who felt that um you know something might happen\nOr others I had these\nI continue um dreams and nightmares of atomic war in the United states and um\nAnd I felt somehow that he was connected with our sightings of this my last month type creature so in that sense you know that was that was kind of a disturbing situation you know to get old days nuclear\nNightmares as I told him you know from paper saying these strange creatures was was kind of you know be disturbing\nUm you know and I think you're a you're careful not to take too strong of a position in defense of some of these cases are but occasionally you will make a comment that let your readers know where you are on that you will respond to\nCritics who try to just brush it off and I I Know you have to be careful you don't want to commit to any of these things because you know it's hard it's hard to prove it one way or another right\n[noise] well yeah it is hard to prove anything but I mean you know I've ... I've spoken to probably hundreds and hundreds of witnesses to strange creatures all over the years and what I found is that the vast majority of them\nDo come across as paying like overwhelmingly down to a rational now of course it fails I bet you're always going to get someone who\nYou know how Cheryl tries to ... just to find to say still just some crazy person buts what I found it to the vast

I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic cryogenic is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it will be but\nI think the other technologies are much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said too but it's been a a I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward is when we use terms like thinking about doing or\nYou know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically\nThat's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movie\nSee that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that starts off as a really good idea [laughter] I couldn't go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely\nOh I Know absolutely and and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies Rhett are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about ... I in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day\nNo these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... they we are creating these incredible robots artificial intelligence that we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing\nIs the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the ... song a giant I inevitably come back to an subjects like this history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla\nAnd and the the the I think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approach on this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being state based\nAnd ... and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion\nOf not just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there to show you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something on we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give him credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise] um they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you can\nUh reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this that\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe our perfect base in their\n... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew\n... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot now if you can imagine\nOh no I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so\nHere here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are brilliant\nA lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be and\nI explored Hindu wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life\nAnd she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like a pie or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic but\nAnyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of\nFaith faith I'm a Christian and I take my my faith very very seriously and so\nWhen I say we need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system\nIs I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets the faces of some there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we go with the next ... the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... next on coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\n[noise] about the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for them what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we've become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and uh I think on another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know ... and never mind are trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example there's such a good way in California right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of the technology that that ... aims at improving our how Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving immortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people elite\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking it and we're taking\nIt as a behind and and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ... do you talk like that to the people in Salem no use that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter]\nWell I figured if the late night show so\nI'm trying to lay down on that one okay asleep\nBut you know nevermind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know it ties at the white you said what but uh [laughter] but um\nBut I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling bug out houses\nRent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape for this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executive uh and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanging as ... ... ... lives in ... ... because yes the idea of having a bug out house right yeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophies\nRight it was ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point [noise]\nI I'm more thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done they they they they they ... that was there a moment\nAnd the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example\nWhen you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could you know a ... quantify society hit the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff\nYou know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance to do it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age do you well time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting I by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside\nWhen in fact\nWhen Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere in the ... at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always\nLike plane a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure I I'm just curious has said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he\nJust not just a job and you know he has though [laughter] I was appointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at\nRight now you know [laughter] but no job for him but yeah\nIf you're in physics at college and now you're not [laughter] but no job\nFor him but yeah it ...

that's how it happened to go right now still there's two men on\nAnd the top of the fifteenth and where will keep an eye on it so sorry Joe ... the the island to Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is\nBut I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know for his theory you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look at a windows Siri is it snowing you know or you know Google ... by ...\nBy me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials at everybody's focused on that type of it's just like kind of get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the downside of having a microphone connected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about and that's the other thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if you're absolutely right I tell\nThe story of a little girl in Dallas texas who use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by me you know there's a dollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and parents are totally clueless stuffed starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it ah but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... election now are you\nKidding me I mean that could take away having leaders [laughter] yeah I Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and\nAgain I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter maybe it there in the Saudi ... they have a they have Google and they had the little theory whatever and they monitor that way\nBut however it happened that kind of the debt that passive listening that is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our cut a country I just had an op ed that it will be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nBigger than just the kind of a that'd be refrigerated or your dishwasher everything that's going to do\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now I'm more than eight billion Internet\nOf things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplishes because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show the thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch [noise]\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join the mystery\nThe end of life as we know it Michael Guillen [noise] next uh coast to coast am in for George ... on it [noise]\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is\nSure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are spying on every aspects of our lives they can tell you when you were asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate\nUh you know if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean there are that this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves than\nWe are well these gadgets\nYeah and I liked a lot of them I mean I were an apple watch by the way they use that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a law and order episode last week [laughter] exact same\nThing they took it from the real life oh did you know they always do\nYou know ripped from today's headlines too but that's where I mean I\nI think that they like to catch a killer is one thing when people listen to all good they kind of killer because of the ... the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system\nWhich accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face prince\nRunning a that they've not you're covering the yeah\nAnd and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy\nRun with which raises the possibility\nThat you and I can have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere\nAre saying it's it's more than twenty percent\nAnd so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a ... a screen up\nA McGill in the end of life as we know it let's get two key who's in Virginia on coast to coast am Keith\n[noise] hello can you hear me in a perfectly good a knife on my own turned back up to go and\nGet a question from Michael\nYes Michael and I argue or speaking about the ah Jarvis cart\nHave a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience and service even there's a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh but it'd be great to have him on to tell a story\nAbout a lot of things I'm One of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a of\nA heart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery at some paranormal experience is one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's as if ... or whatever was\nPut right in his mind and he did the surgery a from those instructions said he was able to see him on his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm a wrestling Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to 'cause I Know we have our time is precious and I open lines is where that kind of belong\nSo let me go to a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracey\n[noise] yeah I got one question for you here where does it and where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we that's a good question but are we playing God yeah and when do we played God is maybe another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate question the traits he's asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs to now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who's in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with\nA dynamite you know you pick your you you pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink or\nThat can really within right there but it was everything else\nI think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or aren't we\nOdd premise are we playing God or aren't we would we cure a disease if the disease is natural it was as God made it natural and the earth is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular phrase phrase\nRightly that's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really encompass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant\nI I mean that can be said we're playing ... for ... what I like to do is what I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story\nYou remember when they lift the oilfields on fire oh totally I what\nI was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil fill a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew away through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of traces question is\nI see as their icy as navigating a mine field and you know so far we've\nBeen able to avoid a stepping on that one mind it's gonna do it in\nBut as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but I as I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that one hit and mine\nAnd it's just going to blow us up\nOkay remains to be seen I think that will be the end if it if it comes that way but now I Am committed okay\nSo you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics [noise] let me just give you\nWhat I think is a better metaphor though for for science in is is we had to get you had you know let's say the the goal was the other side of that minefield [noise]\nWell you just simply going to have to say there are going to be X number of scientists are going to have to run through that minefield and enough scientist run through the minefield the goal will be achieved [noise]\nYou know that there will be some casualties along the way as their inevitably are the the the premise that I'm most worried about is not whether we get blown up in the mine

or any kind of question you want you to have the answer right there [noise] well I'm a person asked her well who do you think Jesus was on her response was a fictional person\nBut then ask coop Mohammed was and there was a famous religious leader hey garbage in garbage out buddy\nYou know a very interesting things I hadn't heard that about a Alaska Alexis ... and that's how they programmed her to to say that\nThere is of course wrong and and not accurate I'm not just wrong but historically there was obviously and I think even people who are atheists who studied the subjects come to the conclusion by and large\nThat he was a historical figure\nA as was Mohammed but that that's crazy and I hope they fixed that I that sounds like something that they would do in Silicon valley though doesn't it\nUh let me go to um marry who's in New Jersey on coast to coast am Mary\nAround how are you tonight I'm going back\nTo your guest um people get the cutting edge I possibly that's\nWell that's a great question the ghost in the machine\n[laughter] like a robot look trekking that's [laughter]\nYeah that's an idea I I Would think possession you know generally we talk about possession of the soul so if it's\nIf it's just a a machine you know a complicated hammer um it would have no soul that it could occupy but then again you talked to other people who say that in adamant objects\nYou know become the uh uh the resting place or the attach ... place for you know a spirits from that will are unwilling to leave an area so they become attached\nTo a thing so maybe not in sold as we would say like there's an instrument possession but who knows you know that's what I Love coast to coast you all are always bringing up [laughter] never thought of Paula is in Omaha on coast to coast go ahead Paula\nYeah let's say I'm a\nI remember when you're on the drama and what was my drama\nUm [noise] the\nLast quite so what's the line now until my tonight is yeah when I began\nAnyway anyway um there are people out there that are in English or they're really lousy and I really really really right here and I think you have any right when our al had\nCame out which two weeks I just walked around [noise] and I I ... and I mean on Saturday when I get our oil\nYeah sounding how can you keep it simple\nThing there is certain people that are so beautiful and show wonderful world literature and it just kills\nMe and all that and I think you're one of them\nWho oh you're very sweet but I agree with you and I think that morning period after art I think it was just it just even though many people were anticipating that this complication was going to get worse I\nI think it you know if you'll pardon the expression I think we all you know lost her breath over that we just to just cut us off guard\nSo yeah and I'm Sorry and I I Know I I think I think you have any illusions highway\nAt ... and at this stage of quick like are there it's a ... cat hair\nOh cool toy and I grew up and I

but I Love the engineers they really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they could just builds up to not enough and I'm All right so that brings me to oh Keith from Virginia is back so Keith had called the um when we were talking with our guest last hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have him on here for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called back heat so you you had a friend who it was you were telling a story about how it is the surgeon had essentially experience to kind of\nAlmost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely delivered where he suddenly knew exactly what to do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand that and um that individual by the way and and uh thanks for having it back on and sorry for not being a little bit quicker smoother with everything but um somebody very topic for eight disgusted and and they are related to some of the things I wanted to say too but sure\nThis gentleman Dr wrestling now and uh also had a a he relates experience of a failure or twice in surgery which his patients died and they were children and they later many years later\nA visited him from the spirit world and delivered a message for him to give to their parents and so anyway this individual by the way is the same time I'm now from that in a ... at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been an apostle for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having less is\nWorld renowned medical career became the credit of the church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three and a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy\nAnd let her things and which things revealed by the ... just gave a little bit more in height and tied on like things are touched the coast am that there can be perhaps the conduct and for ... informed at length\nAbout her normal and things from traditional Judeo Christian teaching a that we find them and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other officers that he had\nA profits and he brought about a lot of\nNew scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYou know and we're going to get about thirty more seconds here so go ahead I basically\nTo wrap it up to be a turtle man is one concept that he spoke about any taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman Napster and there's a very good Youtube video Jennifer Smith and the recovery of eternal man because a lot of those principles\nSeem to than Boston by you know the the church from the council on some of the scriptures had been lost that that were the basis of the creek\nWill have to leave that for\nA LDS scholars to sort out um [noise]\nBut that's interesting and I I I have a lot of friends who were LDS so [noise]\nThat'll be conversational ... iced tea\nSplurge have little caffeine or All right so a coming up next our that are more shy next to have a more open line calls will give you all the numbers you need tickets wherever you want to take his coming up next on coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nYet but the thing of the ... moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it a ... but the scissors independence or the ... and this little cup holder whose district moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost making an argument like maybe the jar was on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh\nBut I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the than the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled you guys I'll go with that until it got any other theory too\nSo yeah benevolent pulled their guy so I'll go with that until it got any other theory to a a back in a ... show is in Wyoming on coast to coast am Michele\nHow high fencing and I'm Sorry I'm Around not like they're all\nFirst things first the first things first [noise] if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second okay I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you\nWhat I was wondering why it's\nLike I was raised as a Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because you know I just I don't know that's that's the way I have inside an room hair gas Michael I'm crossing and when you first got on\nHe was talking about that you know that scientific side of\nHim and and the way that lady\nTold her to read the Bible and now it's sort of changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't have a very strong with religious staff exactly but um\nIt's a little bit like I ... I Wonder\nHow often when I'm driving down the road and how they can trust the authenticity of the Bible because [noise] you know [noise] I have often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the ... and the story of a you know like a [noise] a savior\nOur hero type stay on the line of a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like ... that the call tax you know like ... ... talk for like ... and ... you know whatever creates the Bible Sao\nYou're talking about the ...\nYou're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the in the guild diminish narratives should the news story [noise]\nUm and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God a ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that so the question to me\nAlways is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of it is my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up\nBecause I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true ... it has in it\n[noise] okay\nThere's a there's a difference to me\nAnd there are truly does that we know to be a worse steering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good do you you still have to be good to them because it only makes us is Jewish worse\nYou know and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories tell the truth the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest the\nBible it failed it you know story that can be found in other places we can still try you're saying like the other information on the bottom\nWell know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who when Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr the other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying she were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it it do you can you do you live your life better it does it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science\nThere's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think [noise] um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nOkay let me think of that let's my best answer for you open it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas\nAnd there's a lot of time out here to thing foul [laughter] good\nWill be a big help your bed ma'am a gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad your was your first time I got to be there with you\nUm I go to a adjusted who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey hey and it's nice to be on my list and that river river actually call them or have you going to take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but I Do whatever you want to get to some more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm not sure if a lot of people\nCarpet on mosque interview a he had with Joe Rogan\nAnd when he smoked ... yeah they're\nThey're I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is a\nVery logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful Wayne says things about like a a guy and a side of an addict augmentation\nAnd uh I really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around\nYou know we have the ability you know the massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school but we just take a loss of classes to learn how to properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of those [noise] no I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built into\nThem you know it's just a fine arts credits that people just take\nThe right to it 'cause it's not that it's dance you know or something so advanced at least ... you don't have to\nGo [laughter] but you know to your point on on a mosque I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological ... solutions are big I'm big on student ability\nUm uh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed\nOr you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I I think that reveal much more of the humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must get some big giant slot machine\nYeah somebody and then you whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I own\nVenus is are you know or at your body that that's a very intellectual it always has some kind of inner struggle\nAnd so I'm a I I'm an investor actually a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh\nIn interviews and uh and has recovered mostly what I live in a day or something like that one effect stock\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be that Iran must we I invested in ... mosque\nRight I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the ... minutes interview in\nHis dentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guys smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better and to make a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels come off right I'm watching the\nWheels are going to eat and just like watching a Tesla the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so\nI'm I I think anytime the head of a company like that become so synonymous with the product\nI think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree with you use it to ingenious\nI think you suppose and stuff a little more on it in ... on public but I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or not he claims that that's a that's a very soon future you know blame it on the Web based in two thousand Nineteen you know what I mean right now than it is\nBut they were mentally getting more technical logically advanced we have robots now and we have all that stuff this could be a thing in the next ten Fifteen Years you know who knows what\nI Hope we don't get to Blade Runner in the next year because it's very dark and rainy world [laughter] it'd be very

really\n[laughter] well I wasn't trying to hijack the show that way but it was just it you know a couple of callers mentioned something and next thing you know I'm I'm John away but it's a space I live in I live in a space during the week so they kinda bleeds through the air I'm afraid if\nYou shut off when you said that job you know people come out of church and they act like an atheist and the reason I'm an atheist this because ah\nI Can't possibly believing in God that show hypocrite or whether you're talking about the outrage over or all all the other God's up\nYou know in the Bible up you know I can I possibly even wages whoa but when he kills children by the thousands while you're talking about high Schober worrisome the age of ... first born Egyptians or the great flood\nOr Saddam ... more of their own data innocent children killed there so I mean yeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative as being the defining story\nSo I accept what you're saying and I think don't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part but let me just say when I say atheist I really mean that in the strictest sense I think a lot of people live their life\nLike there is no God and then when they go to the but to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is all I mean and so\nYou know everybody puts their faith in something let me just\nPut it that way well everybody puts their faith in something [noise] put your faith and money put your seats in sex\nBut your faith in cars that everything these things are going to make you happy\nAnd some people put their faith and having the perfect body or or that they that they're going to have the perfect career and that's how they build the structure of their life around that that's really what their God little she becomes [noise]\nPerfectly fine [noise] I mean that's freedom people will do that I don't see anything wrong with that it's just not how I Choose to do it and then we'll just leave it there so half hour hey gosh darn it we're almost done we could open lines coming up next the coast to coast am this is the ... [noise]\nI don't know I Am a question about it right but pediatric Janet the addition that I bought it because it lasted the second to last for the first one to ask are you in Manhattan, Kansas now\nNot yet but he's asking I'm just I'm I'll be there soon I Am still back in the boxes I'm Still in Phoenix with the time being but I'm getting there\nOkay I looked from mission hills Kansas to younger line and so I I Know where you're going to treat you well\nWell it's funny I have a I have a property and I have a property in view for\nUm South Carolina no I Love that area I feel I don't ... I don't get there very often but one of these days on drugs\nHave my I'm a Hilton Head wondering oh yeah we're neighbors OK\nWell previous caller brought up something about I think he got it up a website where you mentioned that they called Jesus like an imaginary figure I'm let that go figure and then they went into my ...\nHe was elected they asked now\nThat's what it was yeah and and that's what that's what I hadn't heard that myself but that's what he reported elections and I've got to that part\nBut yes he did say that and so immediately triggered in my brain I bought this perfect set of Encyclopedia Britannica from\nThe church mouse [laughter] or and I was so excited and when I got at home I opened it up I might have been the first person to ever open it and I write for a\nFirst part the first introductory part and it was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan\nWow ... ... ... you're going to if you haven't stand is he would probably ... by\nThose down and explain at this with a new format for Encyclopedia Britannica and they created\nThe alphabetical values and they they chose to put it at length in that heart and then they end that the other selections at their discretion\nAnd so when you look at Jesus in this edition\nOf Encyclopedia Britannica\nHas just a few little paragraphs and it it costs to them that that go figure someone who might have live during a certain time period and then it represents there's a way to look in the ... or more information and then if you try to Islam\nIt is like page after page after page in the regular section and still do you know anything about it\nNo it's very interesting that's very ... those are good looking over your shoulder will you talk to you you're doing that it's\nIn it's in a box there you know and I just kind of put them away and that kind of feel\nLike like they're not really\nEven [laughter] you don't you don't see the wrong here you do to reduce the idea\nThat I mean like the as you said I\nI I Know there are still printing they must still be printing a version of you know they done completely they don't want anything to\nDo that after the second to the laugh in slow to buy it gave them hung up or at home and all that and I started looking up things and I thought why their kids and they get this land so yeah you find out I mean if you could do home or on\nThe subway you could look at that I'm breathing treatment that ideas so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between now tomorrow night or I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to ... if I Do it'll be in the first hour tomorrow night\nAn otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again Thanksgiving so it may have to wait a while but let me see what I Do but thank you it's really it's really very interesting let me go to Karen who is in Alaska on coast to coast AMA Karen\nHi um this link and was she was just saying and it definitely ties in with last night there was some gas and um it the show was short um first of all I wanted to stay you are by far my favorite show host and has to gorge but you seem to be afraid of controversial subject\n[laughter] though because all they do that [laughter]\nSo you know politically correct though we can't talk about where they just you know\nYeah you know I I I guess that is funny 'cause I I should listen more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should I should be more like you know you will your nose to say that oh no trail like what\nI wanted to change the subject to in like I said you may go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things I don't get off the air and everybody else and put in a sense where um than Mandela Effect\nFirst of all you've probably heard about it there yet not knowing loss of memory to yeah we'll ask about all these things called memory and everything in the world remembers that one way and then suddenly it's not an end last night the example they gave with them I Believe it was like they are having sex in the Bible the wolf and the lamb\nVersus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the lamb\nThat a couple of other examples and and it's in any Bible you can find a gift to what I got catalog in the mail today [laughter]\nAnd somebody had a prayer because he was saying last night they had also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog print like minded I don't know for our comfort her sister\nRemember what it was but anyway it was the way we remembered it so Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um\nAnd your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um things that have changed life with like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump life is like a box of chocolate Sally Field do you remember when she\nReally liked me you might me are right right now they're saying\nIf you watch it now says he says he really liked me now\nOkay that's interesting when\nYou know when he was saying encyclopedia\nHow you have a couple of paragraphs about Jesus and pages and pages them all on that last night and I agree with this it's like I said I've been doing the research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying that there may be that there they said something about their goal was to make a\nI don't know portal into another dimension ... think demon into our\nYeah well they were doing say panic rituals outside that place\nI'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now and and ... as we all know what he does you know the things he believes in the many way the\nOther things then we would do she'll still be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you're talking about it because it will nightmares more but here's here's what I Want to IRS when I propose to do the ... the thing I mentioned\nTo you about Islam and above bendel and about Mohammed\nIs that what we often do and I think you're you're getting to this ... this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory into ours and and and whatever we may have held we might have originally thought of the line the way it was you know but then more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know that that they can hear it so I think them in jail in fact is very interesting I think it's compelling um I'm Sorry I missed the show we brought a great examples um I Will say when it comes to Bible translation just remember this it you can't do a perfect translation\nInto English from Hebrew in Greek ... from that era Hebrew enough that era Greek it's impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be changed\nAnd some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know pronouns and people in ... the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping a permanent and putting a person's name id but others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore\nUm and so we have to quibble inform the thing was a verb for a long time I am facing\nAnd we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that the translations keep changing that's great that's the way to beat it up and I hope not politically correct purposes but because it's just a matter of getting it\nCorrect which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to um uh Marty who is in Tulsa and the time we have left on coast to coast am Marty\nAnd the sort of a pleasure I'm honored uh first I've ever tried to call in the coast to coast I've been listening to her like others for years and years I had to hit three eight hour by about fourteen times that I was surprised to be able to get on\nA leading right [noise] I had\nA and it's nice by the way to hear your back on coast once in awhile I bought you uh had disappeared forever\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nWell they needed year hey I'm In discussing a with a couple a gentleman earlier about the Bible\nYeah about thirty minutes ago or so you had talked about how Jesus I'm as depicted as being murdered and the ... but not in the Bible and I think I'm a seminary student I'm a minister I studied in a couple of different Bible college's and uh\nIt says very clearly and scripture that she says I'm no one could take his life he said that he laid it down we're fully he laid down voluntarily I think that's why the Bible doesn't ever mentioned", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "27", "locations": [["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0],

very different subject\nIn the second half the story that involves incredible acts of heroism treachery\nIncompetence sheer terror it is the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the sinking of the USS Indianapolis it's taken more than fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind that official wall of secrecy and blame\nTo remarkable journalists out worked for years to tell the whole story I was totally blown away by their book it takes you right there into the water with the sailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days\nSailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days and days wow what a story a coauthor is Lynn Vincent and Sarah ... will be here to share what is already a runaway best seller of a book a but first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works\nI'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots you know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it's ten years ago to discuss his first book the ... project\nWas a typical day ... boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend and David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police and forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAs it turns out a course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild ... better known these days for his investigations of missing people he's never stopped thinking about or working on the big foot mystery and tonight he's back with a book that's a great resource for anyone interested in this subject\nIt traces the sasquatch story through newspaper reports and historical records that name big what has been around as we know since Nineteen fifty eight but the big guy himself has been around much longer than that these stories go way way back centuries\nAlong with related stories of wild man and giants and we're happy to welcome day back to the program to talk about his original investigation and where it's led that's coming up momentarily\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that there would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that live miles away who someone coming into town\nI started to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal\nAnd uh he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing but I wanted something to a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained\nFor the state of Oklahoma\nAnd Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just cook like brothers\nAnd when the Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the schedule the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes\nThey immediately accept and\nHarvey and I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends\nWe did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of hoop a and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd ah it's kind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh started\nMost vocal the most audacious the most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who put Andrew the sketches Harvey myself and Harvey wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sat in stunned disbelief because the ...\nOklahoma we were sat in stunned disbelief because the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge had hair all over the body but there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss\nAnd they didn't look like apes they didn't have that ape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera ... and it was just shocking and when the witnesses saw the sketches\nA lady and to a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if the sack Lee what you look like and when you talk about the owners they would consistently say this\nIs another tribe of people is on animals is there are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least the coexistence right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area and this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nSo wondering about the hoop areas the trinity river a great salmon and steal headed area\nA has just so much wildlife and if you drive through hoop of from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains than I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about this whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here uh that we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path\nI knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it and many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request\nA ah a PHD name Melba catch them\nAnd Dr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs to shoot blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted\nA many more than ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood survivor\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this be an a\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA and what they showed was that the fight pet went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side\nTo the ... Arab region to Jerusalem to a Jordan ended that part of the world and this is when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in this\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her white a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in the white paper in a white paper\nBut if you are strapped all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't\nIn Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples cells tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants ease Harry noon and night night I mean big what Cal silver haired tickets into the break\n[noise]\nI'm Sorry you\nKnow [noise] known me\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her now people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for here well ... looks different than any other mammal here in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big for her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta there's a lot of attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together\nAnd it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the you up a world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels um to the point of\nFraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence in ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's human but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part of\nThe best I could say is it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with the human match on gender bank\nAnd when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours and\nHow could that be um we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and succeed apart\nBecause it appears that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study\nThey've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia that data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit Melba she's a genius scientists that figure this out\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah because it got got thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um\n... you said that the this\nThis was not engine bank is it now or did they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I made a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well but\nThese things are the\nThree different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eighty how did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases I'm missing people that seemed emit that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded\nIs two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as a description twenty four years eight gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen and Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k.\nThere were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it ah we're Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six and then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with uh\nThey just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article and the missing but I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations is genius there's a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same\nAnd he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the uh appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this map of because it was a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated the same locations as the big\nFight [laughter] and\nBut it was his statement\nAbout giants that were found in past centuries in mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giants\nThe big for that were buried or were they something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the ... century showing that you have legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and Ah yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWell why did these articles pointed to um some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidate were all these went and it's set in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book it's from the Marilyn that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an account or a witness sees this on the ... of a rubber an animal between twelve and Fifteen feet high\nIt's a sheep resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportions the body the feet are two feet long and Harry oh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the descriptions semi modern descriptions a big one\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being\nExcept the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body and so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nNobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up\nSo one of the articles I I put in the tribal big foot book that nobody wants to talk about was in Nineteen thirty four\nThere was a series of trails site incidents in Washington were hikers and

idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but\nIt's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably or he gets away or the evidence disappears however\n[noise] yeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man that have a lot of injury to because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual and nobody\nQuite knows what happens to it but a lot of people just to Pruitt fail you know it was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times ah\nAnd and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt it's somebody wasn't just bone and get in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nA that's not where we associate big foot sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio in Pennsylvania will be so prominent in the numbers and it's because\nI mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundred or so Seventeen eighties where the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived time\nOh exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first stab Bush\nCivilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWell that's ... with Ohio he's a friend and I I went to spend four or five days with him earlier this year\nAnd the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio\nIn the air and on the ground it's really strange [laughter]\nBruce Mac can be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy a boat in person and on the air and in his books or you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of him either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about present day sightings\nAgain from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\n\nUm you know some of the the descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural context now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but ... the character Mobley um you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that you've collected here\nCorrect\nAnd uh I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like Bigfoot and how it's kind of strange\nThat it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it's a similarity um some of the descriptions I I wouldn't have to leave through it here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing\nWhich suggests to me maybe they were you\nThe thing or just a ... kind of a thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans may be read they really were literally wild men out there\n[noise] and usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing\nAnd kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier if they're seen maybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all thrown our conjecture about why that may be happening but it\nHappens too often for people to be fabricating haired occasionally but not very often\nUm\nIf you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the ... are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one I mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where uh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where\nThey put people start their head start spinning but fact where there's this association between big foot in UFOs\nEven in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said they saw a UFO and\nCoast time and space to the point where they saw big foot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds and when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust that will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and they're different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did and when\nYou start to go back and you look at the history of these certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big put people to die hard don't like it the UFO die hards uh like it even less than they they're not comfortable with that at all\nBut you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are and all the way you up those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can ignore it I thought the ... there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual for several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents so they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them in this oh I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely milked\nAnd goes I don't understand it [laughter]\nThen the same man told him he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me don't turn around\nGet back on the horse or get back on my ... a TV and Rowley and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got there\nSo dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing because I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of fruit um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take the earth or they're unarmed of war\nAnd many times when the natives are in the\nMiddle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ... could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did he get their\n... big foot wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast am [noise]\nMm\nI'm I feel like Rome are also a way that we could find out more about wild man because there are Amazonian tribe network is discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour idea of revolutionary and I feel like with them and I hadn't years will definitely have an answer because of their own and my question is\nEasy it's like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones are going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on this and people are has worked real well and you can't use a drone international park it's against the law and there's a huge crime so probably won't happen [noise]\nThat George Bush onto the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should have kind of touch on it for the people here [noise]\nYour work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big ... can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic\nInstance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers and we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal rounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was\nA just outside the window and as soon as the dogs mated noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community and you can hear it it I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans you had alarms going off and\nThe police officers chased that ah I think they've they've found some tracks it led to\nA there's a reservoir there this just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI'm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we describe on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin marker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it and through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the at the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped\nLike ahead with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell you they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nAre there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh uh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um\nHas seen it all over the you went to a base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah I Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind so\n[noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph ... Smith the ones you talked to keen on his saddle um he thought Bigfoot\nIt happened in Eighteen or over five of us are Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another ... ... and he was the ... the prophet\nAnd he ... he ran into a cane and uh he described Cain as the as a tall a figure that was taller than his saddle\nAnd ah adjusted kill these just talked to a cane and the heat and came to introduce it still is that I'm a man I'm Kirsten longer here and there and I might gold will basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls says\nYou brought that up I just thought the morning culture LVS ... that we have you know there's two stories are really famous that story than just chilies this too is Joseph Smith nephew you\nKnow his brother had an encounter Leslie Smith in Hawaii at the dedication and the the lady Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one uh came came to read the doors of the temple\nAnd I'm In his hand or\nA Wesley Smith said that he that was the priest and to cast came out and somebody he wants his hand and they just crashed a cat and king wrong and so it's interesting you say that we can and art church you know like some people who is skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush let's not talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances because I've been reading this book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot you taking all he does he have any idea what's going on because like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a ... everyone listening here to tonight is probably the the weirdo experts in their family and then there are ... social circle\nA you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles for information about these kinds of topics they are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big foot type\nEncounter or is that something else\nWell the description that the Smith gave was would match big for it but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nA Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nAnd the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said a mind spoke but more like it spoke to him\nSo hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things I've always stated that\nLike this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts\nAll of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion\nAnd why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect when you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA but\nIf you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that is coming to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nDoesn't [laughter] and I should point out that you know you did to address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for recording people as far as you know\n[noise] well no no killing them I I think I'm going okay there's\nThere's a story that John Green wrote about a a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man and he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and\nOne of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed green lead and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how came came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good one is it there are some other accounts in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person through the forest\nHenry about you know\nI think are so low but there's a story\nOut of Wyoming\nThat I I don't put much Clinton said it because people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a girl disappeared in Wyoming\nAnd to uh people who are poaching we're out in the woods and they claimed that they saw big for carrying this body under its arm it appeared dead\nSo these people never came forward I don't know who they are a district was given to me from another big foot researcher that's well well known and this guy was called supposedly by these two guys and then he told me so it's third hand down the line\nRocky buddy Afghan someone it's pre

know I get the double hour dozens of books per year I Can't think of anything I have read in the last five years\nThat affected me as profoundly as what we're about to discuss you know I saw a review of this book months ago I knew we had to check it out\nAnd it exceeded all my expectations the subject is rubbing the writing is the research is meticulous and this story this tragedy really touches a nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours for anyone who is not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard of what little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to\nOne of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws Robert Charles character went delivered of moving powerful

injured and that was what really sent her on this fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nWhen general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan Project including President Truman decided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb\nLittle boy with later ... head to the forward areas and trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that Truman did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because at that time uh everyone thought that there would be\nAn invasion of mainland Japan so\nIndianapolis was selected to transport the station of components of the bomb she did that a native record breaking run to a Pearl Harbor\nAnd then pushed on to twenty an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bomb and then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across the ... from Guam for the Philippines and all my straight west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the specific or Stevie middle of the Philippines these on July thirty is Nineteen forty five minutes after midnight\nOr she intersected course with the Japanese submarine called ice fifty eight planted by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah how she might have passionate have fired exposed for he does it Indianapolis with two of them\nThe first one almost completely lose a foul off the ship Indianapolis the heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit her image shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was very very quick about three hundred men went down with the shift\nOf a little under nine hundred made it into the water alive\nAnd when they made it into the water those who survived their wounds were very optimistic if they were going to be rescued and but uh they weren't and they've spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd died as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've bought the hydration they've a shark\nOr eventually they fought each other because of the madness and that is the story that most people know about Indianapolis she was a spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights for days and the water\nAnd only three hundred and sixteen men survive\nBut Sarah secrecy plays such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and they continue to sort of continued over after they drop it off\nOr wanted to share with us the how secrecy or ... which obviously was necessary military necessity a lead to tragedy and how you'd probably interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that\nHeld secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being lost at sea for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages were transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there was a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that\nIndianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was an admiral McCormack and the message he received was garbled and so you know political said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them\nYou know that was one of the first thing I'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was\nProtocol ... the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive lieutenant thought well I guess I don't have to report that either and so\nHe took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship wasn't there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then\nBeyond that\nYou know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines see reporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't\nArea well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the coach has been broken and that we were using that and so\nYeah he should not have been\nThere without an escort he should have had and\nTaking a step back in the Annapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns and so she should've had something you know first of all that sold our second of all that had\nAny harm or ability yeah armor to an arm or I\nMean she was part of the treaty cruiser so her armor with exceptionally thin compared to many of the new leadership and so that was one of the reason why she thinks so quickly uh you know\nSo all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm\nAnd so much of that played into the secrecy of the mission and why she was out there and why this information and was it passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions knowing that there was a direct threat in its path\nTold me that was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there that I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nWell I think a big part of it they mentioned is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families talking with them\nThat you know with no other interests other than learning their story\nAnd so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know the screenplay and eventually as a book and lend as well when she came in we had this trust built in with these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell the\nAccurate story however heart and however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWell he was a it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters so you you you have to know these people are a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives your piecing them together I guess from people who did know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back and land on an apple a story because really the man or the Fort Hood astronaut as it is to you know circle back and the men who\nMarry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army on Robert and I'm major named Robert Vernon and spent the last couple of years of the war running down all of the novel material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb uh on the continent of\nEurope though one that messing with them\nAnd then burn and very components of little boy in Ireland\nUm that is the final grade and better and in Europe and and if the conflict and so in writing the book we try to pull back that lands and bring in a lot of other uh characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hush and we've had him for the call and tell me you've got to leave and come ... commander\nAnd what we tried to do or where to begin to recognize it even of the men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing well\nI'll tell you what are we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy beyond goes to goes day or\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against her to call at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military\nUm he went around saying on doors at radar and more technology for his that marine has gotten a summary didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and said he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of it\nUp until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother says commanders go down to solve the grave for lack of technology to eat very caring you had a wife he had three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called fun um we were also able to interview his granddaughter a and get even more information about his later life have before\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because of the U.S Navy I mean they took the extraordinary step of having him testify in court Marshall per capita McVeigh and then\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of about things when but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm sure I Want to get to the moments right after these torpedoes swam a decided the Indianapolis\nOr chaos breaks out um\nYou know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a distress signal are not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there tell us describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes hit\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if he would say it's lucky for ... the clouds you just part of the moon came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship and so you know after it was struck\nIn the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first them see\nYou know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations\nThey had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship so with the chaos happening and the ship thinking and twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt first to\nThe star bird and then it goes down by the bell so\nMen are being trapped inside\nThe ship unable to his state from their compartments and you know Linda mentioned before they believe about three hundred and men went down with the ship and even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after\nThe ship was torpedoed all the way until you know men went down with her\nAnd were able to escape so these men were spread out over a mile and a half is what they believe and you know those who went down on or went off on the ... the low side they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship\n'em but no standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side well the majority of the men went off that side\nAnd there was no supplies so they weren't in rafts they were you know somewhere in even in life jacket\nSome were holding on to flotsam that they could find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who can help them you know fellow ship made or whomever and others had to just swim until a sailor would pass away\nAnd then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead Taylor and put it on them I\nMean this was incredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year olds that had just got on the ship\nNot some of them not even three weeks or a month earlier you know they just went on board right before the last mission hadn't really gone to any drills yet\nSome didn't know how to swim and there are just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship at the last moment\nWe kind of a red vain actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very thick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like tar on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer I'm you know they they say that those who head injuries didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering are from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this feel\nSo no one's in really great shape\nYou know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe there's a ship in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nThat and there wasn't that it you know there were attempts to get a signal out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful\nThe um I guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that the new ones coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding a because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and in these big waves are pushing the group's further further apart right I'm\nLynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit are you in this context there's incredible acts of heroism that you describe from some of these sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there's some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nThat's right um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned\nThe current they move in about one mile an hour in that area and they also move in these sort of giant eddies or world if you will\nAnd so two men that would be together in the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve that swelled some days it's it's clear his glasses on the day of the rescue but Sunday's there these twelve twelve along with these current so\nOver time over the course of the the five nights and four days and then become spread out over a twenty five mile area and I'm One of the rescue pilot later wrote that from altitude\nI read the plain looking down on a situation like that the head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they were invisible\nAnd you mentioned acts of heroism acts of cowardice one ... one real hero was I'm\nA captain park he was the commander of the Marines detachment that was aboard the ship and\nThe largest swimmer group and the water's the they did at their mentioned the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents the largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men\nAnd kept in park within that group and he really than\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep the men together the only resource that that group of men had decide their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets with the things\nAnd had the sides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jacket\nWith a single line that was about a hundred feet long\nAnd so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line and kept in park would uh\nHelp the men that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from a dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times\nAnd he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day he succumbed to hallucinations and and he died and when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave man can't make it how are we all going to make it\nAnd then in terms of cowardice um you\nHad precisely the opposite happening with with and then being a selfish\nSend men or even officers taking place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place I'm worse there was also the ah in some of the rap groups they had some supplies and there was hoarding\n'em ups supplies and and of water especially\nThat's what I was thinking as I'm\nHearing these stories even without the injuries and the terrible burns and the the fact they have no water supplies they're out there in exposed to the elements for days they they have no water and after\nDays they're just going crazy and then uh you know you have to deal with the sharks that's the that's the terror that most of us know about because of the movie\nAnd uh apparently that is not exaggerated but not not by much any way of Sarah maybe you want to talk about that part of the story\nHuman Services dumped us kids and the ad council the following these made possible by ... basketball [noise] because the players get dribbling all over the\nStory rejected migrants on the move finally apprentice Saudi Arabia is

a half months later\nSomething amazing happened which will be teased tomorrow on my hot actually contract\nAlmost staggering about this one is that you could come back to\nWhether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference but he was testifying and Japanese through a translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said\nUh correctly and commander ... could understand enough English to know that but not enough to\nReally repair the damage and also he was you know in this very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either but I'm In\nLater interviews Sarah I found out from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted was that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that ... in part had been kept in the day\nHe was angry years later Sarah right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis the submarine the namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built or I'm Sorry captain and built Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was\nA he commissioned bill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know\nKind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter\nExplaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty\nAnd you know kind of did what he could do in order to help exonerate this man\nYou tell the story in the book about a Nineteen sixty reunion a crew the survivors and kept the McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because\nYou know he was court martialed um he received as you noted the book these terrible letters from family you didn't feel he's been punished enough\nAnd um you know I'm\nReally guilt tripping him for years afterward so he shows up at this Nineteen sixty event and how was he received or when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen\nSince Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal so they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named safe city Indianapolis, Indiana and kept in the day was dreading it that when he got there they actually um\nOut a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the air\nOut a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed to receding lines\nAre across the tarmac because they didn't have jet ways the way we do now they would they would just they would the plane right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines and when captain they they got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs\nSomeone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to chair and the clapping and tears came to his eyes and eat and he couldn't believe that they were receiving him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSarah talk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records a share with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get past and and if so what were they\n... actually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and\nJoined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking so you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so\nWe tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report\nAnd we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know\nFreedom of freedom of Information Act should've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the is the source to get and our contacts said well we don't have an an redacted version doesn't exist\nAnd so interestingly enough you know a friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and saved fifty three men his\nHis grandson was actually um\nI'm an inspector general sorry I'm trying to remember the title he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who\nGot us this document and this kind of showed us really testimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed and those final moments but what was happening in the water because\nIn the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony is about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nMcVeigh was viewed and so it was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new court of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change or stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship saying but in the water for those five nights and four days\nLynn did you talk about the life of media Lee after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken um I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell a few did die and and if you can imagine how awful that\nWas not only for the men themselves but for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue\nOnly to die of their exposure in their injuries um so I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara yes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately\nSurvive so they were taken to the hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some time to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS how ... how ... which was an escort carrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nI actually participated in a parade and then a very quickly they went home uh\nCaught buses and trains back to their hometowns some of them ... got out of the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out and then stayed and made careers of the navy [noise]\nUm and you know this was the greatest generation so the vast majority of them and they just kind of put this behind then they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nBut there were those who could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families um they held it in for years and years and years um some for sixty years um but\nMostly they didn't talk about that today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that that these men were different\nI think about that Robert ... character in jaws you know you get that story bottled up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and the\nUh it's very moving scene in it and that was great I was going to use the clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage him in the book or or or did you always have in mind keeping that in there\n[noise] well yeah it's really you know when let them have gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book you know\nOne of the things that really\nComes out every time is that most people learned about this story from jobs so it's an essential part of the stories history is that you know the public learned about it this way and interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it\nBy watching jobs you know they came home several accounts\nCame home saw the movie were really impacted by it and especially this scene and only to find out their dad was on the ship the scene is about well so you know it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way but that's you know how your dad served in World War two so\nWe've been since er leather Indianapolis is the book when we come back we'll open up the phone lines and maybe uh maybe you've got some questions or comments or calls we'll be right back\n\nWhen he\n\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship\nAnd I didn't know what he was talking about it for the way of and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nThe petrol group which has the vessel that were slow responsible for finding the ship and there's been several attempts and they were the first one to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so bill and I spent the next three hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with them\nThe news that they're shipped had been found and so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened and then it happened in their lifetime I'm ... [laughter]\nMostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a fan Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money suck\nUp winning [laughter] you know across\nThe board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt\nAnd inland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up a to the information they uh you know were they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get the story told what about reaction to the book since it's come out from the navy\nOh boy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Sam Koch who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we make contact with admiral Koch at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny if ten or twenty sixteen and we said while through we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources\nBut if you can imagine sending this real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and tell the whole story of the ship and and give the entire history\nAnd draw a new analysis that various things that happen in the story if you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think\nOh boy we were we nervous about that that he really really has endorsed a story and I went to his full court since he saw what he\nWhat we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great a movie um a full big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned\nOkay we'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions but the west of the Rockies Jerry in Modesto, California has a personal connection to the story high jury\nYeah are you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... to rescue those ... and the water and to help you know one ... you can shoot ... you know\nAnd I never saw my father used to I was ... years ago but I never saw him cry enjoy Detroit and talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he uh with the on the USS that peace will take the oil or that that that the you know the name of his ship that to me I\nDon't know I don't remember it's on ... stone and I was thinking about you for calling ... yeah what was the name of the ship but he did me she was the first one who knew him\nAnd he was talk ... huge horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talk about in the about\nThe chip all the you know all those years you know\nHe was like a you know just it just part of the ethos of that generation but those\nOh yeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea uh he was going to drink your interns many firms clubs you know believe in God and he was a police officer who's officer who Thirty years ago there was an incredible story\nAbsolutely heroic can go into harm's way like that and um if he was aboard the Basset\nOne interesting story is that the commanding officer of the ... that was considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the same if you didn't really know what he was getting into and ah he knew that\nThat had been found probably buy a submarine but they didn't know what exactly had happened and there was um\nA sailor who spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish well fish is another word for it torpedo and head of the captain ...\nHe tried to get everybody out of there he said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get out of here we are going to leave the scene and his officers\nWe're going to get out of here we're going to leave the scene and his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with Iraq you have to be interesting if your dad was had been on that ship\nThanks jury appreciated wildcard line run and used in the morning on good\nMorning ah my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil jade de while he was twenty six years old he was the Ensign doctor\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up one of his uh I guess just she just you know of all of his memory loss and I found unbelievable and eye witness accounts a letter\nOf the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors I've got the letter in front of me it's faded August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this\nTo read this is talk about the sharks it talks about the fact that the pull these guys up kicking the sharks off their rear end showing 'em up with the with a line given a morphine given him penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been at some of the reunions but never did talk about this but the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole town it's its history its historical\nI Would love to share this with a young ladies and if I can get them get an information and\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and Donna O R R gal there will get the information for you will pass it on to win and Sarah and thank you for calling appreciate you sharing that I I'd like to see that myself thank you so how many how many of the survivors are still with us Sarah\nThere's fourteen still living\nClass I don't assume that they still have a gatherings do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm about five or six I think six came this year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet\nOn Veterans Day and two of the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nThey're still sailors that heart and I think think an arm wrestle man when [laughter]\nYou know it's a generational thing well we're we're hearing these descriptions both from the two of you in from the callers about um\nHow how these men reacted to it keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be different now people would be out there on Dr phil or or getting a book deal or something but keeping it inside I don't know if it's entirely healthy but it certainly has changed when you agree\nYes absolutely and I I Do wonder whether maybe it wasn't how ... how the er I I don't know I think yeah I think that generation may have been a lot more stable than we are now that uh it is an interesting contrast isn't it and then I think it has to do with the\nThe um ... the media that we have today and they'd be able to share everything instantly all the time and that wasn't the case back then\nEast of the Rockies Joe in Long Island Morning Joe\nYeah Hi I'm Wondering uh you know that initial parade that you spoke of a ... more than ... percent a bitter sweet or ... or melancholy a given you know how the\n... you know so many of their comrades did not make it\nAnd I'm all set

Native American chief got a law enforcement background so we can kind of smell when it happens and\nHarvey and I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of Hooper and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd ah it's kind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started the most vocal the most audacious the most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kind of went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who put Andrew the sketches\nHarvey myself in Harvey's wife Gina ... also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sent in stunned disbelief because the sketches were very human like yeah\nThe ... because the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge had hair all over the body but there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that apes characteristics that you would think of in a face in the chest et cetera\nAnd I was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady into a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if you ... you look like\nAnd when you talk about the older they would consistently say this is another tribal people is on animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with them at least a college distance right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area and this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nThe only thing about the hoop areas the trinity river a great salmon and steal head area\nA has just so much wildlife and if you drive through hoop of from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here or do we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be\nVisible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a ah a PHD name Melba catch them\nAnd Dr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs to shoot blood et cetera that we bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this be an a\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what they showed was that the fight period went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side to the ... Arab region to Jerusalem to\nA Jordan into that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her white a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could've been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explain to her and he explained to her\nA proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't\nIn Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples cells tell a story that's phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants ease Harry noon and night night I mean big what Cal silver haired tickets into the break\n[noise]\nI'm Sorry you\nKnow [noise] known Neal\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see them on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback of bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her now people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their well big foot hair looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA\nBut if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results and there's a lotta\nA lotta attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the U.S all world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very turf conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels um to the point of\nFraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's human but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part\nBut the second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with human ...\nAnd when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours and how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appears that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this\nThat people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit ... she's a genius scientists that figure this out\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah because it got got thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um ... you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or did they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eighty how did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to miss that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as a description twenty four used ape gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen and Canada\nThree in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k.\nThere were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it we're Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six [noise] and then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article in the missing but I started to pay attention and I got it\nThe article in the missing but I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius is a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same\nAnd he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything goes you know what this map up because it was a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated in the same location that's the big\nFight [laughter] and but it was his statement about giants that were found in past\nCenturies in mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giants\nBig for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the pirates and showing that you have legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and uh yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\n\nWhy did these articles pointed to um some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidates were all these went and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one or early in your book it's from the Marilyn that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an account or a witness to use this on the ... of a rubber an animal between twelve and Fifteen feet high\nIt's a sheep resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportion to the body the feet are two feet long and Harry oh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description semi modern descriptions a big one\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it but\nWhen you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body and so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nNobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up\nSo one of the articles I I put in the tribal big foot book that nobody wants to talk about was in Nineteen thirty four\nThere was a series of trail site incidents in Washington were hikers and hunters and things were getting rocks thrown at them and they saw this figure that looked like a big foot well then they went and told the sure from the share if it was going to get a policy together to go kill this thing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "22", "locations": [["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Texas", 31.25044, -99.25061], ["Dallas", 32.78306, -96.80667], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["Kansas", 39.09973, -94.57857], ["Texas", 31.25044, -99.25061], ["Australia", -25.0, 135.0], ["Las Vegas Nevada", 36.17497, -115.13722], ["us", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["Hooper", -78.41667, 162.71667], ["Oklahoma", 35.46756, -97.51643], ["Oklahoma", 35.46756, -97.51643], ["kinda", 58.01315, 15.73373], ["Oklahoma", 35.46756, -97.51643], ["Oklahoma", 35.46756, -97.51643], ["Melba", -66.5, 98.33333], ["Jerusalem", 31.78199, 35.21961], ["Jordan", 31.0, 36.0], ["Louisiana", 30.12595, -92.00939], ["kinda", 58.01315, 15.73373], ["the U.

expert on the global brain Howard what's your take on this bizarre story\nHazing when it comes to the murder of a dramatic how shall we all may not be as it seems far from it we're told that on the

to stumble turkey and late in weight at the Saudi embassy the ambush ... when he came in to do the paperwork necessary to marry his living girlfriend who as you said as Turkish\nYour show he is a journalist who was once close to get this\nThe new young ruler of Saudi Arabia crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and who went to high school with Osama bin Laden\nShow he was so trusted by the Saudi royal family that he was allowed to have the two major Saturday newspapers all what town in New York Times because show he made a mistake\nIn two thousand and sixteen just after Trump was elected president he criticized Donald Trump he said that Trump's attempt to closer relations with Russia would also bring Trump closer to Saudi Arabia's arch enemy Iran a country that the Russian ally\nTrump

pieces with their own saw all on the Saudi\nEmbassy building and asked them both and for the killers we're ... we're close to prince Mohammed bin Salman ... where is all of this information come from a George it doesn't come from American intelligence sources\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word\nUm I don't know if you did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most description and honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nLet's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was the veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise]\nYou know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper aid that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was assigned to the five hundred eleventh\nParachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne and he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them in did he get that from his combat oh ... ethics yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several\nTimes a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the twilight zone so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly at one called the purple testament which is actually a lady\nUm during World War two so that was as close to the guts of literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and and several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in that golden age of television wasn't he\nYes he uh he certainly\nWas it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writer so I was it was it was this fast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and rod you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much\nThat he just sent stuff out and stuff out and so finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know it shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol ... wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the what he had a a treat with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah now with with\nRod he started before he got in the twilight zone he was a writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was without question the most prestigious writer in television before the twilight zone he had written\nYou know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and she just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama sensibility\nInto the twilight zone and\nGave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times what he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to the twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to quit\nBeans prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\n[noise] yeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that is throwing ran into was that he believe that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writers job to address the issues of his time\nAnd every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get in this way and sponsors were getting this way and he it was frustrating for him and thankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his\nOwn show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loved fantasy science fiction or you know all that kind of thing so he\nCreated the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show where the cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a a television series that just had a cruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know ... it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that\nUm because he again believe that that was part of the artist job the art if it's going to be art it has to what he would say it has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did was to entertain but at the same time he had to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the issues that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate\nAversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils stemmed from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred television series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction of all television series\nAnd the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one it made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting a Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone is it's entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means\nSomething is off kilter or something is strange something is you know not quite right\nAnd it lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's\nI think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it and I had written an article about it in a what we had was called the after dark newsletter\nAnd Bradbury just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about ... by shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nAbout what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no no listen nobody could write every script um you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over\nFive see that's pretty prolific that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season periods just it's\nYou know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty to Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it and maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah absolutely had heart issues and that's what's on demand you said that brought the road to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know there's a couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah he run Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories\nHa ha so if you do is that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us deck we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with a buddy about the twilight zone at the ... with us his book is called the rod Serling is life more than imagination\nAlways on your phone then you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized through mobile users just point your iPhone or Android Browser to coast to coast am dot com and enjoy\nZone ATM twelve thirty gay G are in the river\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick per E.

I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man you're on an iPad [laughter] your voice has not changed all that much really still waiting for puberty to strike what can I say\nIf you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and and I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the ... zone\nWhen you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did is you know bumpers and intros and uh [noise]\nYeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast on a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and we're\nReally seeing kilo the in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled control from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see a Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to them about what was coming up in the next episode or so usually one and executive producer or creator comes onto it said you know but it gets a little uptight\nYeah though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter] or whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that are on rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around him\nAny talk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out for Marguerite has every night\nAnd you know that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six or six and seven and nine\nThat's what how did they find you believe for these parts [noise]\nUm well actually the one of the very first lead roles like it was a an episode of uh Loretta Young show that was directed by James Sheldon the course Leishman played by mom and a and the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me and for long distance call and he also directed\nIt is a good life so having to under my belt or I guess they just you know\nJust called me up for in praise of pets\nAre busy guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days really what's new\nWell Angela car right now I've just released aren't novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing\nAnd ... and go charge on purpose it's called the devils recruiter and chicken and all the adversary his weapon\nFlow you set yourself with Tom uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm ... through an ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music to\nYour the capability thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me how to treat neck I was thinking George so that was great he was a ... I get rod Serling for you on this show you never know [laughter] my yeah my calling from the from the other side what inspired you to write the book about certainly [noise]\nWell I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know ... by the show and and so that started everything [noise] and then really since\nThen I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually I'm dumb this type of thing where for example\nYou know there wasn't even really a complete a list\nOf all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced for television or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had you had gaps whatever but\nSo that it never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I Want to know exactly what she wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been at it hadn't been commercially released um I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography and his part you know critical analysis of the the theme certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know built into and et cetera\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm probably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that\nWas remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly infamous in that regard called it's called noon on doomsday it was broad certainly attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the fourteen year olds\nIn Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until it's a fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some version of\nThis story and Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance\nWell I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these into a interference is came into play and there have been several studies of this particular show in the evolution that it's so from from\nYou know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you know it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nMoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated and he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy in ... he was he agreed with his politics and he he admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of those Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it it's from for it threw him into a dark place for a little while\nAnd strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William fruit\nThat one of the producers on the twilight zone were contacted by the state department and ask to produce a film\nTo introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while it was a documented\nThey needed a documentary they thought you know listen we got to get something quick that we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the assassination when he was\nYou know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished uh\nYeah in fact the you know the uh the the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days [laughter] and and and William fruit said listen that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we said before rather so prolific and he was so\nSuch a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had it they had it ready you know ah I I actually don't do exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nWhat is it about black and white TV shows that have a different feel than the color shows that we all see nowadays yeah\nYou know it's [noise] well I can tell you specifically when it comes to the twilight zone I think that's one of the things that the remake\nOf the twilight zone have been missing is the fact that it's just it was black and white the twilight zone is black and white it's just it had an aspect the Fillmore to them so um the war has got to have that black and white uh\nWe won't leave one warrior behind not on our

almost like an escape from your\nDaily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really like that my second question would be about the mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost a not necessarily\nEthic book could've unfolded into actual movies additional scenes\nUh where uh someone could take a twilight zone episode and kinda unfolded into an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect that the twilight zone and that I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that\nA scape his tone to it or you know it's funny that you mention that because that is actually something that rod Serling are often pointed to about ... gallery ah in the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam\nEra he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know step on the news about war and everything else that they go into the night gallery an escape through that so he never really said that about the twilight zone but I think the similar a point can be made about the twilight zone as well\nAnd it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature film all those there's been there have been plenty of films that are certainly twilight zone in ... you know influenced that could very well we'll just as just as well be toilets on movies that are called the twilight zone\nWas it Jack London on one of the twilight zones\nHe's starting for twilight zone yeah actually they actually started one with the movie um in praise of tip that's right yeah yeah\nAnd he was terrific guy Jack Lemmon probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone in in three of the episodes that he was and\nHe was he a trumpet player in one of them\nExactly yes there's one called the passes for Trump rod wrote that one and I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he the director um jak caught me was so good in that episode this is just so good that the director actually wrote were called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of\nThis guy I just want to keep filming there any way we can make this into a two part episode he wanted to expand into an allergist because jak cotton was so good and rod said you know we just can't be done at the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's that's saying something when director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm going to film whatever does\nClassic classic classic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason go ahead sir\nWell where are you folks wherever that President they say why those radios theater and\nThey take some of the old episode when he ran for radio and they also incorporate resident date things and have a current topics like a just a couple of weeks ago I heard when it had to do with\nA nano robots eating up um oil spill in the problem that that could read it and I just thought that it thank you and I think with the ... state\nCool did you know about that neck\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh uh current radio series no there actually was the twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some not too long ago but no I wasn't aware of of of the current one no\nDidn't write ever writes for radio in his early days\nOh sure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first sales were to or where to a series called Grand Central station that air and I think on CBS um CBS network and the road you know for radio or in college and\nSo yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke and and actually the funny thing is he actually went back to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four\nSo basically four years after he had broken into television he actually went back to work in Cincinnati and created this radio series called it happens to you and it was a series of Thirteen um original radio script\nWhere did he end up living Los Angeles\nA yes or while he once he lived in most in Pacific palisades for most of his a professional career and then he always went back to a if a guy in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time uh\nEvery summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time and it's like the later in life\nWhen he got sick was it a prolonged illness or did you go suddenly\nUm [noise] well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\nHe was fifty years old was any or something\nLike I was fifty yeah he was fifty and get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypass procedure which was and it was in ... new yeah\nTime uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explains you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take advantage of artery from this here and put it here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say any of that you know what a cardiac bypassed us but that back then it was so\nNew that that explains the surgery and he had the surgery and the doctors thought he was successful and um by the time they were\nShowing 'em up he had another attack on the table and that was pretty much\nSteve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\nHi George ah I got a little trivia but a ride a uh\nI live in central New York from Seventy two Seventy five and I worked on a military page called Santa ...\nWith a quote okay and I would say a big a big arts and all that had nuclear weapons are quite a few actually been on that note uh\nAnyway rods home woods about two or three miles from that bait\nAnd a little town called ... up the road about Mao and a half or two miles with little post office where I where I used to have a ... book and that's where rod you could spend that yeah when he he had a a swimming pool built\nOn its property there a couple of miles away right next to the uh bay or early ... and uh I used to talk to the uh\n[noise] a puppet master it sounds like a one room a purge buffet and I said I I heard rod Serling with Iran during the day comes and once in a while\nAnd I always wish I had met him but I never did but I I think that's where he ... or send that tape cuts to Los Angeles who uh the uh contrived in\nPeriods a TV program and uh\nYou know he's very here already you know as as I say you lived right on Lake ... a an ... an astronaut not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate in Ithaca and some of the Senate tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it and that's cool well uh\nWhen his career started the sink a little bit ah he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there\nAnd uh he uh he buried not far from it it's a word ... in a little cemetery called uh enter lake and right on the lake and much loved that area in its wife up when they first got married they had their honeymoon there\nA on a lake or a ... a her\nRelatives parents probably on their property and he bought it eventually and they lived there and they always went back there on a summer to uh write and relax and uh but uh if anything it used to do a little radio a promotion\nFor uh people hey no in the area like a shoe store or whatever might be a store I mean it's kinda cute you'd hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and everybody ... which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of ... he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would have been married things for you know for\nFree for people or people at the college or or local businesses I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his correspond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept and if they still exist and\nYou would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and\nIt's really amazing that that you can't really find a somebody saying a bad word about Russia certainly do\nYou really can Nick we're going to take a quick

Serling\nShould be available just about anywhere you are the books are sold as they say um you know develop on Amazon now Barnes and noble or they don't have it in the physical store will certainly be a blow to root for you or you can go directly to a university press in Mississippi website um to lump site but if you Google that I'm sure you'll uh you'll come up with it there as well\nTell us about the rod surely memorials foundation\nI'd love to hear that some of I'm a member of the board of directors of the foundation at sea Binghamton New York based charity or that looks out for rod Serling a legacy and and promotes his legacy a in Binghamton or as well as around the world really and working on\nYou know we've done a couple of are we called them certainly fast the last couple of years I'm wary of essentially had a rod Serling convention A People's common spoken and certainly in your store and Jodie Serling they've both been\nYou know been there and you know spoke about their dad and\nAnd we've watched rare films and you know had pal discussions and radio perform scripts radio scripts performed um\nSo I've had you know done a lot of a lot of things like that for the community and it's just about keeping rod in the public eye as much as possible and we're trying to at this point we're trying to really get a statue built for them and bring him in his home town he loved his hometown a and that should come to come across through\nSeveral twilight zone episodes and so we're trying to get a statue of both form they were trying to get a rod Serling museum in Binghamton\nSo these are all things that were that were working towards\nGosh I would've loved to have them on the show necklace\nUh I Would love to spend five minutes with him I was five years old when he died so\nTana class a chance or would have been something else what a great interview you would have been oh yeah oh yeah he always was\nTo the phones we go let's go to Linda ... in Medford, Oregon hello Linda Marie\nMy name is ... and I'm going to kill you\nThat once in a class where my favorite ... episodes also\nThe man and the radio or you're talking about me [laughter]\nNo man had found that ... on the radio in ... in the attic\nAnd the whole damn it played music and shows they'd only he could hear the plastic\nAnd also George and when they came around I Would get crazier for um how you thought up this show tonight I mean after after ... is a is a guess talking about haunted artifacts and they're they're tied in together so many twilight zone episode about highly doubt oh\nAbsolutely I've gotta I've ... I've got to give credit to our executive producer release a lion and Tom Dan how's your our producers for putting that together\nYes and also Nick I Want to know um what was the first episode you saw\n[noise] you know that's a it's a funny question because I think most people can tell you for certain what toilets and as soon as the first one is what I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as I could probably narrow it to a couple um hitchhikers is one that I I think it was definitely one of the one of the first ones I ever saw\nBut whatever way right yeah going\nMy way and you can have chasing a you know chasing a driver not chasing evidence just showing up on the road constantly are on the on a road trip on that's a that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I I cannot pinpoint it for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nYou remember the plane that couldn't land in then you we do you look down and you could see the brontosaurus the dinosaurs and it just it kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three and it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times and uh you know a rod and Rod's brother Robert\nRobert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time and it was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually a consultant Rob consulted with him about that particular episode and other episodes they did it ever had anything to do with aviation\nHe went to his brother offer advice on those so he actually got a technical consultant credit on on that particular episode\nNext up we're going to Bradford in the angels camp California Hi Brett heard\nHey Nick was I'm I'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling\nA\nTail it involved what they call the ... that was in a capsule um\nThat started with a guy at a bar looking kind of this bonding or whatever and\nAnd uh probably crying you know trying to give up drinking and somebody came up\nAnd gave him a ... a ... said call this number and uh so he was curious he called it they said well come over to I think it was going to a place where they gave him this capsule and they said but the the one the one\nCaviar is you cannot drink to get money not drink because he's a message\nThat will um it will\nMake you very and very uncomfortable I'll give you a really bad stomach reaction and so ... was was a it was some little organism\nAnd it said on alcohol it was dormant unless you drank alcohol in which case it would wake up then if it would just you know crave the alcohol and make you really really sick 'cause it was growing\nThat's that sounds somewhat familiar it's it's definitely not a Serling I can tell you that's for sure but it does sound that that part about it ... it feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not a Serling\nWere so many classic shows though they all had these different messages remember the one where the camera took pictures of the future yeah and you name it at a race track bored and you get the winning horse and all that\nYeah yeah most unusual camera was called and that's one of the you know your previous caller was talking about a haunted artifacts I mean that camera was an artifact of while it's on you know they they had plenty of those the you know the telephone that only ... movie was talking about they talked to his grandmother on you know there's always those crops that are where the you know where the Gulf and sort of\nYou know so to speak of that particular episode Marion Rock Hill South Carolina have their\nTheir yard was always a way that they asked where he is a God of our ... our love and the ... and so forth but not right and I got to\nA robot and the ... in the ... for that matter of fact I got to a ... one of my favorite story you tell your or just before do that how 'bout that roster and smoking those nasty sugar at\n[laughter] nah it's unfortunate that really was addicted he tried to quit several times he just he never never could quite do it\nI used to think either he really loves cigarettes or ... are Jerry roe we're paying ... a lot of them are just ... ... you\nKnow you're probably right way too much he would he'd come out on the Senate smoking would knee\nOh sure sure it's hard to find a picture of rod Serling where he doesn't have a cigarette in his hand and it's just it was it was it was attached to them it was ... constant\nIn those days it was the thing to do I remember dean Martin lighting up on stage of Sammy Davis junior all those people would come out with cigarettes I mean it was it was the thing\nSure crazy let's go next to too many well in the San Antonio Texas I menu well\nI Do enjoy good morning good morning to you too

popular obviously has some good movies\nYou know I was thinking about the Sears they declared bankruptcy ... last couple of days and I mean here's an institution that is like to me an antique because

were\nFortune alright really come\nFrom the islands and stuff where this was medicine to people okay this was you know part of their culture and it was it was a very small culture so these are very rare\nI Hope they did it with those who died rather than kill someone to do it\nUm I don't know I think I have to think about that but\nAh my hand handle one of those years ago and you know it wasn't a monkey had it was something a little strange\nLittle are they held smaller\nVery small about the size of sauce\nSomething a little strange a little larger how small are very very small about the size of softball how does he do that\nI have no idea if I could answer that correctly I don't think you'd want to know me anymore what ya [laughter] that's true they do they do it with up oil on them down and not different types of medicinal spirits and also little magic remember everybody as magic and our culture and all those other things that I found that\nI found a pre Columbian pottery all and you're going to love this this is ... by\nNative Americans and the Pueblo now the Pueblo people believe that a great race of aliens live there and those blows before they lived there uh-huh taught their ancestors I'm an awful lot about the world and are you aware of those those cultural\nYes okay I'm sure you would\nBe [laughter] um I found a pre Columbian which means they came it was made before Columbus\nCame to the ... world a pre Columbian figure\nOf a a little person now the the the dolls or the figures that they made their heads look just like what we consider a gray\nThe alien grace amazing that\nIt their faces look exactly like a gray with just a little bit spooky when you consider that\nThey had not had the stories about grace back then but that's the way all their little figures look but this one the person is actually talking on a communicator it looks like wow and it's absolutely legitimate and I had somebody on my while\nThis morning or I'll say yesterday now\nUm who is a clear point person my wife found that out but um she I showed her that right she said wing that is on me I have never felt more energy coming out of anything\nI think the antics of energy to especially the people who know energy she said that has so much energy it actually buses\nLoses a replica of something they saw back way before the Columbus era and something\nThat the Native Americans made they saw that looks like an alien yeah and it's actually talking now they they're a bunch of these would have been found and they're they're pretty interesting alone and they all look to saying he's actually talking on a communicator that's weird I'm going to send you a picture of\nThat I'd love to hear most will put it up on our website but that is something else\nAnd I tell you what you pulled your hands and I tell you it gives you is it [noise]\nWell you can feel something ... any everybody who's ever had put an aunt\nGod I'd love to see that I Want it and then the industry for fourteen Ninety two\nFor fourteen Ninety to ...\nYou know the possibility that let's say a fake or anything it's the real McCoy\nAnd to me and stuff you find that when that\nAnd to me they saw some creatures that look like that and they made them they depicted them\nYeah I I think this is a depiction of The Elders that taught them their culture who came down to\nBelieve that people from all the stars were there before them\nReally believe this is a a depiction of one of the star people\nThat could be the greatest proof we've been looking for you know it absolutely\nAll right stay with us

D. V. copies of this big area type and pass them around from city to city to city\nHall right and this book\nWhich has a picture of both Craig's [noise] um [noise] am broke type and the paper copies\nThat they made of this this this these three children that they passed around from city to city to city century up and not watch than a woman says those are my three such children\nWhile those to my husband right before Gettysburg I haven't heard from since\nI'm Sorry he died they go on and tell her the story that's spooky enough but then Craig says Wayne scoping your addict can scrounge around ... takes this is right after he gave me this book\nGo up my addict I live in Eighteen forty house has a few books of its own right\nGo up in his attic and there's this little room where there was furniture assembled but when we bought the house ceilings are only about four foot tall it's a spooky little room it's almost like Anne Frank and her family lived\nAnd there were a bunch of artifacts left over in the house when I was purchased one of the things that was left over in the house was this book ... book of photographs\nOf Craig and I opened it up and there is one of the C. D. V. copies of the same three children we opened it up and immediately there's three kids staring right at us we dropped the book\nIndustry [laughter] I mean that's what kind of coincidence is that right that's almost\nLike that conjured up something pretty doggone spooky\nI guess you got to be careful with what you do\nWell you know I don't think careful I think that the positive things about antiques is they bring about good spirits a lot of happiness but there are times when you got to pay a little bit careful I knew the warns pretty well and they are used to say don't play around with a weed gee boards and stuff\nAnd I ... I Believe that\nYeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly it takes because you know you don't want to open up doors you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely ... when when you do your rummaging and you've been to some of these older places and you find some of these things have you found objects that look scary to you\nAll the time it's often um\nThe the the things that that make them look scary is the houses that are in um [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist or I died and the story was that he killed himself and uh I go through there with my buddy\nAnother buddy of mine who were doing a kind of a an appraisal of this this for a for some lawyers and and and\nWe're taking photographs of these pieces and this guy had spray painted things on the walls that were really strange he was a LSD person\nAnd the house was filled with all sorts of strange uh furniture from the mission ... period nothing had been cleaned\nAnd years and he had like\nCaptured animals and skin them and made things\nOut of them [noise] um that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years and that that tends to make all the objects in the house all the scarier [laughter] so I'm going through this house taking photographs of all the strange things right my buddy won't go up in the addict I Know what's wrong with\nYou because why there's something wrong there\nAre you talking about it because I saw something up there\nI saw something up there I saw go up there\nI said come on man we're working here right it's not time for this right we've got a lot to do he would not go up in the addict by himself grown man\nWe ended up going up in the addict together finishing our photography up there and went downstairs took some more photographs [noise] All right I developed I I\nHad the photographs developed this was just actually no it was a it these were ah this was just the beginning when photographs were a digital but\nThe photographs in the attic all had these weird circles and I'm like or\nBalloons every single photograph in that house had these these weird or sent him none of the photographs before we went up and he had a cat that so I figured I'd spent water on the lens\nAnd I looked at the photographs or taken after we left the addict downstairs again\nNo problem just up in that strange addict that's where my buddy says that's what I saw\nVery strange do you find that the the older the object the more possible that it could be a haunted object\nYeah I think that um age has an awful lot to do with that I just because there's more chance for stories to become attached to an object you know sometimes an object dies made and you know it's a table that was made back in ah\nGeorge Washington's timely and I want\nPeople cried when George Washington died and most of America did those tears went on that table and that table experience that death and and uh you know people ... things into those tables and you know all the all the experience of life\nFor older people falling and breaking news you can be devastating for more tips for making home safer does it also info dot org slash falls a message from the American Academy of orthopedic surgeons and the orthopedic trauma association\nPlease clean the gutters just be careful on the line\nI'm going to take action legal in Canada finally uh Francis Crick tourist state Mike Pompeo also in Turkey this morning after meeting with Saudi leaders Tuesday to find out what happened to a Washington Post reporter believed to have been murdered by Saudi operatives in in stumble meanwhile some members of the Senate are ready to take action when the Kenyan reports\nIt's a rare moment of bipartisanship for the U.S Senate following often costs state parks and fighting but\nThe gas and Jim ... has tested the limit so what will the Senate do what I Would do I know what I'm gonna do want to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia that Senator Lindsey Graham who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee this guy's got to go to ... speaking such strong terms about Saudi Arabia is especially\nThe guy's gotta go to ... speaking such strong terms about Saudi Arabia is especially biting because gram has been one of that country's strongest defended this guy is a wrecking ball he had just gotten murdered and that conflict in Turkey and to expect me to ignore it I feel he used and abused ...

this the New York or Saudi Arabia crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon and who went to high school with Osama bin Laden the show\nHe was so trusted by the Saudi royal family that he was allowed to have the two major Saturday newspapers out what town in New York Times ... show he made a mistake in two thousand and sixteen just after Trump was elected president he criticized Donald Trump he said that Trump's attempt to closer relations\nWith Russia would also bring Trump closer to Saudi Arabia's arch enemy Iran a country that the Russian ally\nTrump and his son in law Jared Kushner were tight with the Saudi royals control these criticism displeased the crown prince though in Saudi Arabia to show he was banned from print and media totally couldn't print a word to show he took refer refuge in the United states and became a regular contributor\nTo the Washington Post the show he's um\nA connection with the Washington Post may have made him a useful tool for the church to his great disadvantage we're told the show he walked into the Saudi embassy as you said and never walked out supposedly was tortured and here are getting killed and cut up the pieces\nWere they bones saw all of the Saudi embassy building an instant bowl and for the killers we're ... we're close to prince Mohammed bin Salman that we're just all of this information come from George it doesn't come from American intelligence sources\nUm I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most of his strips and and honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly was a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um\nYou know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this\nUm this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper unit that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was assigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne\nAnd he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected\nPretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality\nTo them and did he get that from his combat oh ... as as this yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the toilets on so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly one called the purple testament which is actually setting lady\nUm during World War two so that was as close to the guts of literally\nRevisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television was any\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when\nTelevision was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writer so I was it was it was this fast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and rod\nYou know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much that he just sent stuff out and stuff out until finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol ... Raj wife\nI did not unfortunately no the what he had a a treat with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod he started before he got in the twilight zone use a writer for other kinds of shows listening\nOh sure sure throughout selling them and some people\nMay not know this but Rob showing was without question the most prestigious writer in television before the toilet so\nHe had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five\nFifty six and fifty seven uh toilets on started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap ah before the twilight zone came out and she just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama sensibility into the twilight zone and\nGave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times what he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\nYeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that Serling ran into was that he ...\nYeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that certainly ran into was that he believe that it's a writer's job to do those things it's a ... job to address the issues of his time and every time he tried to address any\nIssue of any social import on television the censors would get in this way the sponsors were getting this way and it was frustrating for him and\nThankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loves fantasy science fiction or you know all that kind of things so he\nCreated the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it'll be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show with a cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a a television series that just had a cool twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that um because he again believe that that was part of a the artist job the art if it's going to be art\nIt has to do what he would say it has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did want to entertain but at the same time he had to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the issues or that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue is prejudice um rot had this this innate\nAversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils stemmed from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nShe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was wrecking the top one hundred\nTelevision series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone it entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is\nOff kilter something is strange something is you know not quite right and it lasted all this time because of of rods messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good\nYou know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's\nI think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and it's a Bradbury had heard about it\nAnd I had written an article about it in a what we have what's called the after dark newsletter\nIn a bread Bree just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about my ... my shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nUh what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five seed that's pretty prolific that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season period it's just it's you know and and\nAt the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty to Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted here's just addicted to it and maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah absolutely had heart issues and that's what finally did him in you said that brought the road to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty other the total shows such crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well\nFirst of all yeah you're a Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories ha ha so he knows that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us decorative and take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour and we'll take phone calls with a buddy above the twilight zone and Nick breezy with us his book is called rod Serling is life more than ... than imagination\nAlways on your phone then you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized for mobile users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy\nWorld thirty AM and you're listening to goes goes [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMan will come back to coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick per E.

was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did his you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise]\nYeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast on a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and work\nReally sing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled control from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see a Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to him about what was coming up in the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes onto his said you know but it gets a little uptight yeah though that you know or when Alan's hair [laughter]\nOr whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around them\nDid he talk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every\nNight and you know that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six or I was six and seven and nine\nThat's how did they find you believe for these parts\n[noise] um well actually the one of the very first\nLead roles I did was a an episode of uh Loretta Young show that was directed by James Sheldon the course Leishman played by mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me and for long distance call and he also directed it's a good life so having to under my belt or I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pet\nBusy guy and you were you were in ... now what are you doing these days really what's new\nWell Angela car right now I have just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing any time and go charge on purpose it's called the devils river and chicken and all that this Harry his weapon\nFlow you set yourself with Tom uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm ... through\nAn ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music to\nYou than us the capability thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me how to treat Nick that I was thinking George so that was great he was a I get rod Serling for you on this show you never know [laughter] you might you might call in from the from the other side what inspired you to write the book about certainly\n[noise] well I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know mesmerized by the show and and so that started everything [noise] and then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I I just wanted to collect\nAll this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually I'm done this type of thing where for example you know there wasn't even really a complete\nA list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced TV or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had you had gaps whatever but\nSo that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I Want to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been at it hadn't been commercially released um I Want to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the the theme certainly was was dealing with an a character types that he you know that he researched and you know built into him ...\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm\nProbably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about\nThe sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly\nInfamous in that regard called it's called noon on doomsday it was rod Serling attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the fourteen year old African American a boy who\nYou don't know him until it was a fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some version of the story\nAnd Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance well I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these uh interference is came into play and there have been several studies\nOf this particular show in the evolution that it took from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on TV [laughter] well but none of those studies had\nThe actual first draft and I just luckily found the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you know it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nNoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated them he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with the politics and he he admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so\nIt really it just yeah it it it's from for it threw him into a dark place for a little while and strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William proved that one of the producers on the twilight zone were contacted by the state department and asked to produce a film\nTo introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world\nWhile it was a document that they needed a documentary they thought you know listen we got to get something quick that we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's\nHere's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished uh\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days and and and William fruits had listened that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we've said before rather so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had it they had it ready\nYou know I I actually don't know exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nWhat is it about black and white TV shows that have a different feel than the color shows that we'll see nowadays\nYou know it's [noise] well I can tell you specifically when it comes to the twilight zone I think that's one of the things that the remake of the twilight zone have been missing is the fact that it's just it was black and white the twilight zone is black and white\nIt's just it had an aspect the Fillmore to them so um the war has got to have that black and white uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to

listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or removed\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections but I just mentioned\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted off their student loan ... huh\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first\nWorld countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless\nYou are making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today\nIs the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nPeople like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants or so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise]\nUm they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so the founders you know they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan ... they were going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\n[noise] sure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default\nOn alone and they want the default don't that's right if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead well that's a defining hallmark of uh\nThem when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead well that's the defining hallmark of predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantor ours\nAre often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where you know credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they're going to ... percent commission right off\nThe wall so you\nKnow where they can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they compel to borrow or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that ... a federal student loan system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nNo explained the process of a default alone in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure does a that's a good case I'm good easy numbers to start with so a fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduates what say they'd they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years uh they're unable to make payments they\nLose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment\n[noise] um the student can expect to learn to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably default it's somewhere around oh let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars\nWell with penalties and fees and capitalized interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty\nTwenty by hitting the ball or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly ... let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars\nOh my God so what the\n... what the lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment\nWe can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or so ultimately they will wind pipes um\nHopefully in the government hopes of going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments for about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that ...\nThis rehabilitation at the end up process they wind up signing for a much a newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan\nSo in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or these agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation\nGet a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus ... it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nFees and the ... in these agents are collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guaranteed horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than ah than alone there remains it's good said I could probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nDo not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate\nThey default again three to four\nTimes and they just keep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan defaults again\nAnd that happened something like eighty percent of the time\nThen the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here in the again we'll take calls next hour with Alan Cohen coast to coast am\nSign of no go zone or read email newsletter today at ... dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas Jefferson one said there are two ways to conquer and slave the nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens\nMore often than you would think George is they will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the summons then they become subject\nTo arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams\nAnd and and forced to uh to come into court that way to deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWill that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly are and just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison [noise] uh that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war as far as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand now they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these defaults fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settled on is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know if people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan default is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so that you know the the government has got you where do they want you on these student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nUh you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um [noise] I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to realize that\nYou know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoked suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment and for the case of default is student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a part party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse\nUnder Obama Obama essentially federalized the lending programs so that where before a bank such as those that I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae Nell et cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans\nAnd by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program now Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before\nHe said why is the government property not student loans this is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it\nA and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five you know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the ... system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know Donald Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him a et cetera so who would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nI'm a et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nWho herself had stock in St on collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds [noise]\nUh so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could a file bankruptcy wipe out your student debt what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise] some of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away and so um\nSo yeah Congress ah ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that\nWe've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing this is a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan Collins is one sided student loan justice dot org linked up and coast to coast am dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\n[noise] oh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called H. are twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um delete the one line of federal code that make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings\nSo this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed a we would immediately see a dramatic\nDecrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program [noise] ah so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nHandling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma or is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan issues well absolutely\nAnd I agree and nobody wants to file for bankruptcy is a terrible thing to have to do and and even more difficult thing to fight for I should say [noise] ah but it's just the threat of bankruptcy that would really help the lending system but you know there there are a lot of things that we can and should be doing you know as I mentioned earlier President Johnson\nPromise that the loans or she would be free of interests so why can't we get back to that why should why like Donald Trump said why should the government be making a profit on these loans\nStand together to sort of\nWe stand strong\nUnited [noise]\nStand with us and caring for our veterans charged when we were like illness I only have friends who is the former president of USA

protections encourages predatory lending\nUm and of course a tuition and inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on her arm and hand crafted dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt as college dead\nOK I already knew to do it how positive but now there's one thing\nThey don't want to mention and that is ... I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost won I lost a four to three split decision in the saddle case I'm pro life pro gun I'm as far as conservative as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay\nBut the college tuition is technically and legally attack because there's money going into an arm of the state government college\nAnd were being over tax that though it was real and matter of fact the private colleges about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and hear the fang okay we spend a lot of money on our military\nAnd it it's too much really we spend a lot you know even at the conservative we spend a lot of money on those the security but we can only cut those things a little bit the on the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans\nAnd we don't need to spend any money of that not only does it the tax dollar on the hook and it's going to crash the dollar like grief or Venezuelan Georgian and I'm\nAlan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of a large group and I hope\nHe's gotten on an equal talking a little too much you know [laughter] but I I and all of\nThe reason is here's the deal OK\nAlmost ten percent of the total that it's college dead and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we're going to get rid of the lab and get a credit card I'm okay with that line but let me get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar and it'll save the standing with college will drop like a rock\nAnd the I I Love I Love my rates man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police looking here if\nI can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get but look we can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout and handouts\nAnd if all these rich banker these colleges can get rich on the students looking here that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nThen okay and they use the third or I we uh got your point there Gordy Allen\n[noise] you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all his points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq I think we can throw maybe a trillion or so at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view [noise]\nYou know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be a good thing it would return prices\nBack down to a rational levels uh and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWill go with all the debt right now Alan would you just a white dude clean\nWell I Will say that if they had a minimum bankruptcy protection is we're not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge hum settled that debt according to their means\nIf that does not happen then we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nWon't let you do have salaries teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[laughter] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large they could probably suffer eight thirty percent if not forty percent reduction\nIn the student loan income that they're currently receiving\nAnd still be able to keep their doors open not have to\nUm that they're currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia\nUm [noise] so yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground [laughter] you know and with bankruptcy back in with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other lender has to contend with\nA that would go a long way towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah hey mark go ahead\nWell George you said they can't uh they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school\nI was on a full scholarship even pay promote books but the federal government makes you go to a student loan counseling so I went and I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this did you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know over\nFifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student\nLoans and loan balance as a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon ever pay it off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark\n[noise] no I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero [noise] um I did a double major in a minor and some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think Yellen these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay back I mean the college\nAnd some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's\nIt's just disgusting [laughter] hey you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that to mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program so they're a bunch of government programs out there that sounds like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness\nThere's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know is that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trained for that forgiveness are actually getting it so the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments\nWell interest continues to accrue on that loan so so that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of\nThat I'd be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so twenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nThough the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from\nSallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so uh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students but many many years ago\nNow and we're going to come back and take final goals with you in just a moment here on coast

did what many homeowners do prices from quote unquote professionals\nAnd we couldn't believe the high prices not long afterwards I decided to take a chance and with no experience in the industry I quit my job in sales for a fortune five hundred company and I started a business selling custom lines on the Internet in two thousand ten lines ... dot com was born\nI not only guarantee you love our

dot com lines T. E. R. dot com and goes\nOn AM twelve thirty Katie are in the river bowls coast to coast overnight son twelve thirty Katie are at\n\nHand welcome back this is our final segment with Alan ... says we talk about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] well I I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point uh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars is more than Ninety billion dollars a year\nOr so that's money that gets taken away from home purchases or you know business formation\nA auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that didn't prove the economy [noise] ah so certainly is hurting in that respect [noise] uh\nAnd you know it's it's also running in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels typically the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um\nThis really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't other wise do\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy [noise] ah and certainly those people will pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nLet's go to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you think Michael thank you very much Georgia now them [noise] um I graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise] I'm I'm One of those fortunate case who\nAre at one point three to aloe we're talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I ah got thirty four thousand of the thirty seven thousand but I got you know that I owed\nForgiven wow how'd you do that graduations and\nI appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of a hard way um\n[noise] there's something called a you'll finding out what that is is that like a lifting of pretty much like a courses you cook or a trade the trader Joes yeah and what it is is um if it of course he'll uh the reason they're the situation because they both by ... so if you were\nFrom a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school\nI'm pretty much that's when they committed a that broader so it actually took me from I Would have to say December to ... to around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all but given what I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris email\nUm she surprisingly bonded um but the avenue that I went to go after given the right a cover letter I submitted a pretty much what the ... the political idiotic than I had to pretty much just a put it all out there what I'd gone through ... at the summit transcript that to a\nA cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had to prove that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that that got it reduce I guess right\nAh yes that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the college commercials what being a problem with the life long job placement of quickly\n[noise] so what how I false advertising yeah the exactly so one of the schools shut down there goes your call on the job place there goes your your life long but at the right you got that right or interesting Alan isn't it yeah that\nYou know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up at some other point to show there are some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like the just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where if your school the fraud you\nThen at least on paper you have available to you an avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday I'm One of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of do away and slow walk this ... this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely\nHave to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you're you were lied to by particularly for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for records you know\nWhile you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the note and they don't provide it to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right\nAnd similarly for student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh ... well first of all the loans has been bought and sold so many times that whoever's says they owned a note actually does\nNot owned a note and they have no business collecting on that loan I'm ... now there are other\nThere are some avenues that the lenders can go to they can say that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove that is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to Twenty years hands and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than\nAlmost certainly that loan is not\nPrivate loan than almost certainly that alone is not\nLittle suspect little there you suspect\nUm and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where you took up alone\nGo to pat and Minneapolis east of the Rockies hyped ... go ahead\nI worked in Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at ... at least one of the agenda as is the destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with co signers of grandparents parents and still none of them are ever going to get a security\nForum I have a question and I think Justin\nAlright if if I own a house and I have co signed on one of these student loans that does that lean on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans\nYep there goes to the lone first doesn't it well that's a\nYeah that's a great question to her first point yes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing icy legislation out there right now and has been passed yet\nBut I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going their Social Security when they when they reach retirement age uh so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to\nTake away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you have one of the things that your family\nHas already where multi generation the grandparents and parents and the kids are never going to get any thoughts as scary but my question is that if you have if you want to help the students and tear up the already you write a check to the school or a money order or other travelers check or whatever\nAnd all and the kid brings yet you know says\nWell here's my transcript for the last semester you want to help me this semester and when you hand over or whatever you're going to help them with don't forget this pet\nGive them a pat on the back and say the whole family is proud of you for being such a great student and such a hard worker\nWell that's part of being a good parent that you've got to do that with a child [noise]\nYeah you know I might also comment on the\nThe the question about coast signing off I urge all parents to never ever co sign on a student loan for a student that's just the worst thing you can do I have seen families just ripped apart by these loans and indeed the lenders including federal government", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to
