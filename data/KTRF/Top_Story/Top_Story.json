I was doing the show with\nThe firm salaam last night during the game and I did that numerous times so did I think we're approaching the time where people start freaking out about potential college football playoff scenarios you know where it's\nLike is might seem going to be on the outside looking in and what what is is that if they get home there's been this has got to be a Trojan\nLike settled down man he said he hadn't even had a committee pool we haven't had the committee poll remain out\nYet you know and I didn't realize that people are freaking out about potential scenario here relax\nHave a pop tarts take a breath really right\nYeah it's easy but no today will be there\nWhen all is said and done they will be there and I love that because I think it's good for football the the Irish or their idea like that I think why they're there may be on crazy but you know that the Yankees are good for baseball when they when I think the Green Bay Packers are good for football when they went and I think Notre Dame is good for college football when they when I was that\nYeah I mean a lot of people would agree with that it's definitely a theme that people have a strong opinion about either love them or you hate their guts and you'd think their fan base is largely largely pretentious and there's\nThere's a lot of truth to that there's a ... day and you're right I get that but yeah that's good when you have that divisive type team man the sport always wins out and so yeah it'd be great for college football if they're there but you know we'll see how the rest of it shakes out when you look at the top\nOf the standings here when you look at the rankings Andy\nA couple of teams dropped LSU loses the Florida\nOklahoma goes down to Texas Auburn got smacked around by Mississippi State so that's number five number seven all drop yeah his top ten is going to look a lot different heading into next week\nAnd no doubt about it and that's good that's great because it creates a lot of fight a lot of conversation and you know the gays probably meanwhile they really do you still looking at the top but not the top of the NFC North is that upside down I got to turn it upside the Chicago Bears on job attack us to one in one they've traveled to Detroit\nLions I mean rarely a truly what's what's going on with the bears on a ... I mean are you kidding me I mean come on what what\nWhat's happening look he has this one aberration game against they really horrible and bang the\nBuccaneers defense Chris Conti was hurt\nRemember the guy who got trucked by Vance McDonald remembering when it was this is the Monday Night game when the Steelers and the buccaneers and Vance McDonald the tide in\nGave that stiff farm from hell to Chris Conti will Chris Conti is on IRR yet Vernon hard graves is on IRR so they've got a banged up in a bad defense their defense has gotten shredded steadily\nAnd Mitch ... he has a good game at all I've been\nHearing is oh look at MIT strip is gated well look at the if the rules in the deep but ... it's like he had won an aberration game look at the bears week by week here's what they've scored twenty three twenty four sixteen\nForty eight do you not see something that stands out among all the other game that spike is not normal really no not at all so Mitch ... performance is being grossly blown out of proportion but then I kind of put a kind of a little cold\nWater on you for a second if I may may I Do that when he got hit because when you talk like this about you know everything's out of control and you're right you know I'm not going to argue with that it reminds me of like the uh the Phillies Seventy sixer fan boys remember when they said they were going to win at all in the play offs but the Seventy Sixers are but I had\nTo give these fans are I mean that's what they live for that's what they live that's where the law and there's all of that really made you an eye out to be the voice of the common sense than\nIf I knew some of these people are out of control I get that but let them live let them have some fun\nNo no I was well within logic I Will not stand for fun like I'm all for fun Andy you just can't be unreasonable\nThere's a lot of will get into it a little bit later but this Baker Mayfield auditor love fast you got the ravens defensive coordinator Don Martin Dale talking about he's going to be a\nLike a bread Barbara John Elway and it's like he's just as bad as if he had four turnovers against the raiders and we're talking about Brett Farr or John Elway\nWhat I settle it down years so that's the thing you can be a fan you can get ... you can be optimistic but as soon as you get on reasonable that's where it's like being a fan isn't a good enough excuse to beat dumb he says you're not\nYou're talking about a coach and then I'm Talking about the media when shame Darnell came to New York they went crazy with him what happened to him now he's yesterday's news no one told us about Sam Donald anymore he's not the savior for the jets at least this year maybe next year he will be not this year it's over\nWe had his day on opening day and that's the end of remember the back page of the tabloids going crazy there wasn't a statue for this guy but you know what the only statue that she'll be billed as for Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay and they're going to win today tactician I don't really that\nI Do not know that a beat Detroit today come alive you want to put some Scooby Snacks on this one yeah\nYeah I don't think the lions

hear it\nYes this is from grizzly chief here right then and said it's been raining all night here in Casey and looks like it will probably still be raining at game time might not be an offensive game for the jeep today that plus jak defense make me weary\nOf the chiefs wind today might be slapped best interesting there is some entail needs help from grizzly chief\nPsyche grizzly chief you put the paint done you know these guys go to those games with the war paint I mean again you see you get upset with the fans that go crazy that are over the top like your ... and ... and it's just luck than for the bears right and\nThat's fine I mean that's your project I get crazy when I see watching a game on TV and and the camera pans to a guy understands that we're in like a ... it's really I\nMean a a guy that we're not really I feel like the Halloween there'll be unbelievable in the state and I've always wondered when you're driving to a game that they were these costumes in their car driving to the game\nYou have you with that like the raiders fan that we're going to raise noxious outfits I Love that stuff you don't like that\nI cannot imagine driving my car to again getting ... going to a stop light turning to my right or to my left and seeing the guy in the car next to the Batman outfit I just don't understand I couldn't I couldn't picture that really I just could not All right I'm just saying\nYou know what I have an dressed up for a game\nBut I don't look down upon it I like it that's other people's deal at school with me I have a much less of a problem with people doing that than I Do like they're crazy opinion and now you're worth like ...\nAnd I am a insert team here they're or they're going to win at all and it's it's just ridiculous man I Know that that's why you and I are so well\nVersed because you know we kinda like rub shoulders into some sort of a way you know I might this damn paper to you I'm I'm the ... paper I Know I Am in a sense um rough around the edges\nYeah oh that's good man that's because not all bad oh I'm going to talk about\nThis team they got to win and they could have had a second when the one two and one that's the browser lost an overtime game to Oakland forty five forty two last week I had to make these even worse I don't know why they do with just get us all said there was a bad whistle which costs the browser full recovery you know and\nWhy why would you like pour salt on an open wound you lost a freaking game the coaches they're probably news updates\nPour salt on an open wound you lost the freaking game the coaches they're probably knew it was a bad call but the least got confirmed it like on Wednesday or Thursday to say oh my goodness what a punch in the guts if you remember the places like some six minutes and thirty nine seconds left the regulation Derek car the quarterback of the raiders lost control of the ball at the miles Garrett\nAnd you're not a very of the browns hit him in Oakland or look on the thirty eight yard line Garret recovered began running toward the end zone the referee won't do this instead of whistle blowing before the ... because cars Ford past\nHas a stopped the progress I understood role to play a shock and the rate is punted on the foot down that was the end of it and the NFL in ... in a review said it was a fumble why they do that\nYeah well I think a lot of it is due to gambling now how the rules have been relaxed significantly\nI understand it Andy with you it's like well you can't do anything about it now so what really that really do it's all about hey hey it's we're on the up and up\nWe just missed something no conspiracy going on here we're not doctoring the outcome of games and that's all it is and it's been a ramped up now that gambling is more prevalent so\nYou're going to have more of these situations and I think a lot of people they'll look at them be like the browns got hosts it actually didn't end up hosing the browns because the raiders punted\nThe brown scored a touchdown and actually shoot up a good minute and a half as it turns out that could have helped the raiders out so you have to look at what happened next when there was a bad call it clearly was a ... should have been ruled the fumble\nBut as things turned out the brown scored a touchdown any way on the ensuing drive so it's a complete wash\nIt's just that's why they come out and be like oh hey everything's cool but it the more the myth Mr NFL PA earlier this week he was pointing the finger at the NFL which I mean almost never happens Andy and he was like I don't know that they've done enough\nIn terms of all of these gambling situations where you have some owners that have\nA vested interest in whether it be like a fantasy sports and he's like how how is that exactly going to work and we haven't done a great job of making sure the game is here and I was like how exactly can you do that and what do you how do you do it how do you ...\nYou can't the only thing that you can do is if there is a brutal hall and people start calling for a conspiracy is to say no no we missed that are bad but we're not doctoring games here we're not in the business of going to federal prison if\nBy thing Baker Mayfield can win his first start or not you know it's crazy yeah\nI I kind of opened my eyes a little bit now I understand why the NFL is doing that is the gambling situation you're right I mean and if a person like myself was not a gambler per se and I and I'm not saying that you are but you're more averse to it that than I Am the most you someone invite you dabbling in a little bit and I really do much so\nI ... yeah yeah that's not that there really isn't about this ravens team I mean\nThere are surprised team did that three in one and getting not much respect and I tell you I said in the beginning of the segment that speed kills and the ravens habits they got to revamp line if they really do Michael Crabtree and wide receiver John Brown this guy could run\nThat speech just really need this team right now is a is a remake it really is and it's given new life to the quarterback and situation and Joe Flaco he's having a\nHeck of a year and it's because of those guys\nYeah and you know you look at all the three in one teams in football right now outside of the same in jaguars\nIt's like almost all of these teams are getting a lot of attention and you don't want to buy in your reluctant because right of recent lack of success dolphins ravens who were just talking about in this game bangles bears titans\nYeah all of those teams are getting overlooked and it's not because of this year\nIt's because of what's happened in the past but I see your point Andy what the ravens and what they're doing that only ... billion Joe Flaco has been playing better than he had before and the weapons are better there in terms of a wide receivers to throw to\nThat defense pretty good I like their defense over there and you get Jimmy Smith back healthy\nUh uh well off of the the suspension you get him back in that secondary\nSo it's going to be a big test for Baker Mayfield who could not have more rose petals being thrown at his feet right now it's getting kind of thing at this point the guy's twenty seventh and pass or rating\nI'm going to say right now if they lose today in Cincinnati all the air goes out of the bubble I was going to be a will always managed to use a fan saying the same old bangles yeah especially if they kick it away the same old bangles you know that's the way definitely fans are but you know really a truly you have to understand they used to that in Cincinnati there really are\nWhat was the big three weeks stretch for them because the bangles there at home against the dolphins today they're at home against the Steelers next week and then there at Kansas City so\nIt's the day there at home against the Steelers next week and then there at Kansas City so that this should be a win for the bangles and when you've got to dealers in case the coming up it needs to be a win today for the bangles\nAnd I hate to say this as a bagels than I Want you to do well they could have sat glued to the next three\nWell yeah I mean they could easily drop a game to the Steelers into the cheap saying right outside the realm of possibility that the dolphins beat the bangles today that the like the bangles or a juggernaut or anything like that\nBut yeah I think that there's probably a man is there a better chance that the bangles go she wouldn't want her one into over these next three cars assuming I win today you give him a win against the Steelers are Casey who say they drop both of those\nAnd you know what I hate to say this because I don't want to be on the fence I'm not that kind of a person but I really would rather shit ... bad okay\nI Would say they should go one or two but I'll tell you why should I I really would rather see\nHow that Roethlisberger place today ... is is he under down swing or she just had a couple of big games that's what I Want to see in Pittsburgh I just you know it's like you say you know people say they they they go on past results well you know what although the Steelers right now are hurting I still look at them as what they have gone\nAnd the bangles or three in one I think most people looked at what they have done that is why you're not buying it with the Bengals history of one or you're not going to buy that this deal is there a failure\nYes yeah and ... right yeah is that true well that's the way that you\nMake a lot of sense I'd love to go again I Do I'll go against your bottom barrel betting but there's a better chance that they go one into\n'em but you know it's one of those teams the bangles or one of those teams until they do what you can't quite by in there the reverse patriots you should be late to the party\nOf saying the bangles are going to do something significant you should just wait until they do you do it you should be late to the party of things the patriots the demise is here\nJust right wait for that to happen before you said because you've been proven wrong\nSeason after a season after season and this might be the latest installment\nBut are you ... over you adopt which I just want to hear it\nYes yes louder and louder and louder as\nAs much you can get Andy at this much man as you're going to get over here you know what but I Will check it out with this just to kind of truce it up a little\nBit yeah\nThere's still pride over your Andy ferment but noted yeah I Would push comes to shove I

three man show we're doing it three men we've here apparently I\nWas good I had a question for you though\nAs an option for you after that\nThe guy with President Trump criticizing the move by Dave Roberts to go to the bullpen rich still had a one hit or did you have an issue with that\nAnd the way I did I mean the guy was rolling along on or was he had like a one hit are going on there I mean why why would you make that change I mean you know we are so I mean manages right now in baseball so\nI in tune of getting to that reliever and then I didn't get into that closing them out of what may happen I mean maybe he'll learn maybe people will learn right now you can get your rear end burnt you know if things are going well sometimes go you've got to go with the gut rather than a goat stats\nYou can get your rump see it as we run the fields of a Bronx talk radio over the you know here's the thing Andy is what I always say if you aren't first guest thing I don't want to hear the second guesses so to be fair maybe President Trump\nAnd some of the people that are highly critical of they've Roberts going to the bullpen when rich hill got hold in that moment maybe they are like what is he still in\nBoise pulling the guy that's got a one hit or if you're saying that before you have access to the result okay I'll listen to you after you have access to the result right in rye imagined doesn't get it done can ... get it done so forth and so on what that bullpen right\nSetting they're like All right makes then no big deal one Harry look good but bullpen for nothing lead they should be good they should be fine and then you circle back and you're like\nWhat was the kid if you want to be a ... at the time I don't want to hear it afterward\nAnd there's no again that could be second guess more than the game of baseball and you know as far as President Trump is concerned he may have gone after they've Robin because maybe they've Roberts is a Democrat\nI don't know I don't know why I wanted to have Robert you just they don't go with him you really don't\nBut I'm hardcore baseball fan you know ... words fan\nWho knows what he is I don't know but I Will ask you this you do that radio show on a daily basis and then one of the city of Portland, Oregon\nI have to know this how much World Series talk what's on your show this week just out of curiosity you're in a non major league baseball market it right World Series at one point in time but was V. event V. event\nUh right now no one's talking about it not many people are even watching it\nWell not a lot and we weren't talking about it a ton but I think that also has to do with how the game's played out at that point it was eight to nothing a Red Sox lead in the series you know\nAnd it wasn't like games one and two there wasn't anything that was huge you know\nThere was a huge story line where like I got to weigh in on this it was one of these where okay why didn't they start their left handed guys why was there no Jack Peterson ... next month the who hit the walk off Homer in game three right there was no Cody Ballenger like that's\nThat's not a huge topic at all so it didn't have a whole lot of legs it didn't have a whole lot of traction now these last couple of games without what happened with Dave Roberts last night the marathon Eighteen inning game there are some layers with that that can be around for sure\nYeah and it was funny because the Eighteen again I'm not so certain how many people even stay up to three am eastern time to watch it but you make a great point is a great talking point because people will go the office the next day and say did you watch it and it's a ... did you see that you know what happens\nThings like that so yeah I I just think right now that baseball is just sort of a flux if you will as a downhill spiral and I don't know what they're going to do it I don't want to talk about it because I Want to talk about college football and what happened yesterday and I ask you right now let's give the first four teams right now and and the AP rankings perhaps this week I'm going to go with Alabama Clemson for one to\nArrive number three I got to go with the undefeated Irish\nAnd then another throwing the Ohio State even though they lost last while ya know LSU and what are you going to put in their\nOhio State Ohio state's eleven NBA people right now you got to know what got them in the way it's going to it's going to jump around I just don't do you do rise by ... by ten points at but what do you do\nNot agreeing conference by conference I mean you look at Oklahoma they've got a week's schedule they really do do a pack twelve I'm not going to go any body that impact well Washington state who do they do they play so what do you do tell Mandy\nYou've got three teams he's Alabama ... well a a head of Ohio State right here right now you'd have to go with LSU looking when Alice you've done they smacked around number two at the time Georgia\nThey smacked around they went on the road and beat Auburn and I know Auburn isn't ranked anymore but written statement when you beat a team that's highly ranked\nYou can't circle back and be like wow I mean look at their the ranking now where they're really low you're you're right about that time you're right it's like it mattered it's hard to remain highly ranked if you'll lose the game or a couple of them you know it's impossible almost\nAt Michigan certainly is more worthy than Ohio State at this point they're only lost his at number three at the time being right now Notre Dame you compare that to Ohio State losing on the road to Purdue it's apples and oranges\nThat was a terrible loss royals there but you know what though is going to be really interesting and ah it'll play out because the end of November\nMichigan will play Ohio State we'll see what happens there with the Big Ten and it was it a win that so it's kind of wide open but you still have some dominant teams and like the three dominant teams in my heart of hearts or Alabama ... I got a flu Notre Dame in there I really do that the dominant right now during the ...\nYeah I mean what you do not put it on the team in there they would be in right now I just can't go with dominant when you're struggling and barely beat Ball State Vanderbilt\nA hit you know these teams playing top and\nThat in his second game of the year for Ball State that's they're Super Bowl you know right\nAnd then then they've got role but I think that only goes so far if you're truly a dominant theme even though these lesser teams get up to play you you still should win comfortably and they have it so I Can't go with them as dominant but yeah they would be one of the playoffs teams right here right now there's no doubt about it\nAll right well we move on but it's not going to leave that to arrest him over to the national football league the jets the bears the jet stream for the bears the three three my line Chicago given up seven and a half seven and a half points to adjust to that what do you got eight\n[noise] why do we mean handy to see why I don't get it every week it's called the Internet you was it was it the minus nine and a half that to point unacceptable\nAlright well why am I getting this seven and a half then I and I don't know I don't know if you don't know\nWhere are you at what do you want to reveal the site of choice that you know what goes on and one of them out the site than okay [laughter]\nAnd the biggest challenge I guess right now is going to be for the jets rookie quarterback Sam Donaldson according to new media reports\nEver providing and then the three sources for prevention treatments and recovery [noise]\nWe're working hard every single day to reduce the secrecy and remove the shame of addiction\nSigmund shattered live rise up against addiction so not in life and lost to the to the children to shatter proof movement get involved today and learn more at ... dot org slash race\nThat chatter ... dot org slash rise\nHorse right now [laughter]\nGo back\nAnd let your colors cry\nBombing Iraq [noise]\nSlave labor I'm telling you buy bold predictions for college football this year I had all the action may scream [noise]\nIf your fees are covered right here on Fox Sports\n... or so with Fox NFL kickoff joined several ... of top opinion makers as they provide unique perspective an expert analysis we sent our last day at ... am eastern on Fox Fox Sports [noise]\n\n\nAgain America will take a peek at just about ... minutes when he passed the hours this is Fox will fill Sundays Brian oh I'm Andy for a minute by the way we're probably brought you buy guy going I got some\nGreat news is a quick way you could save money switch the guy go go to a guy go dot com and Fifteen minutes you could say fifty percent or more on your car insurance now Mr no I got the updated lines okay I really do I hope so I've heard before\nOkay let's do this with the sea hawks at the lions both teams are three and three she looks lost to the ribs us it was a good game thirty three thirty one lions beat you adopt as thirty to thirty one and as far as I'm concerned the line I'm looking at right now [noise] Detroit given up three to Seattle\nYes wow Andy holy cow yes but do you mean what do you mean that is correct I'm Glad that the scores are up to date as well because you're worrying me with the point spread the or at least you have the scores of the games correct\nYou know they don't go there as well look I let me just clear my main here if I may number one I Am not I'll be quiet on I Am not a gambler I\nKnow I read these lines okay yeah I have no idea that I look I understand it's a public service that most people will watch games put little shuttle to on the games I've done that at times okay but the people who lives in a week or ... the public service of giving them the line on these games at all be someone informed of what's going on\nYet I had no idea that these lines would move so much from last night 'til this morning oh I don't the Andean\nGood game day of course they didn't move on\nYeah I I ... I mean this is ... what do you see going down in this game because you look at too good running attacks surprisingly with the sea hawks who couldn't ball hardly at all now all of a sudden they cranked up that running game was Chris Carson and you look you carry on Johnson that young rookie\nFor the lion's who's had a really strong season to get too good running games\nYou've got kj right coming back for Seattle which is big you get tied into addiction back as well\nSo that helps you get Seattle coming off of a by week but Seattle's him play good pass the fence and you don't have a real Thomas back there so this is talk of bandits it's just they literally Vegas has it adds typically the home team gets three point that's exactly where the line is there like hey that you call it what do you so you know\nI I Would say that is the CEO of probably run the football more than any team the league and they could have a big big us that poor lines decent we both agree on that however I Would say there's the lions have more of a balanced office I think that Seattle does and they can Al Gore Seattle's attack and I think that Seattle\nCould create turnovers\nBut I don't see it happening I don't see I I like the lions doing this game I really do not by much but I like the lines to invade but three or four\nYeah well you get snacks Harris over their Damon Harris than coming over from the giants in a trade that should help out\nThe lions horrible rush defense or they've been giving up an NFL high five point three yards per carry this season thinking about that Andy ... three yards per carry that's crazy I tell you this ...\nThis is a spot for the lion's because they've got a much better shot in near division than the Seahawks do when there's with the Rand looking up the rams that's completely out of sight but right look at the rest of the NFC North from the lions point of view if you put together a good performance and beat a Seattle team\nWhich isn't close to what they once were and they are totally ... if you win the game\nAll of a sudden you're born three got a winning record\nIn this game all of a sudden you're foreign three got a winning record\nAnd you're at least neck and neck with other teams in the division the Packers could easily lose today at the rams the Vikings could lose at home on Sunday night to the same you know you can be right there in the thick of things if you win a home game against Seattle and it worries me because it would be\nA complete lions thing to do which just had not show up and lose the game at home after a nice performance last week against the dolphin\nRight and Seattle's got it on the football that's basically all they do because why they run the football because I think they're passing attacked a somewhat weak I really believe that so I'm just one dimensional last science and if they could run I think they can\nRun against alliance and gain some ground heat up some ... run the clocks they've got a shot I don't see it happening even though the Detroit Lions as susceptible to giving up a lot of yards I don't see it happening I think Detroit was this game\n[noise] yeah [laughter]\nIt's rough man I Would go the other way it's not a strong disagreement by me Andy\n'cause I like the lions it's just one of these it's a classic spot for the lion's to pull the lions you know yeah ed at NYU and you don't have a great rush defense in Seattle can be multi dimensional offensively I I don't love they're passing game nearly as much as the lions\nBut I Do love Russell Wilson I think he's dynamic he's completely capable of at least\nPassing for a decent amount of yard edge making some big plays you know it's not like jak Prescott before you got to mark Cooper in that passing often it's better than that and I just look for the alliance did they shoot themselves in the foot somehow some way do they do that today\nAnd I think there's a decent chance after\nChance and speaking of people shooting themselves in the foot I mean look at the Cincinnati Bengals I took them for a second because I keep on going back to what ... told us several weeks ago don't fall in love with this team they're hosting the Tampa Bay bucks Tampa Bay street free bagels a foreign three but more than that\nThey've lost two straight and everybody was talking of Cincinnati Super Bowl Super Bowl that foreign three right now where they really\nOh they ... they made that they want to pay a little over there but they they just want to go to the play offs to hell with the ... really but the point there's just so hungry for a winner and\nA team started off so good and now they dropped to this is one of those watershed games because it's going to be if they lose this game the players are going to be a rough road to hoe if they learned today\nAnd they're expected to win but these teams look of themselves in the mirror and almost the same tremendous officers on both teams\nAnd what happened last week I don't know what happened to the Bengals office but they've got demolished in Kansas City forty five to ten bucks beat the browns and over time so that was kind of a you know lock the fate of twenty six twenty three but to me Jim is Winston led the bugs and rushing last week and I see him running roughshod over the Bengals defense today\nI yeah you've got a lot of injuries on both sides defensively where you look at Tempe and they lost their middle linebacker Kwame Alexander who is a good player might not have Gerald McCoy today which is a big setback their secondary the Tampa Bay secondaries incredibly banged up so I\nThink since he's going to get back on track\nOffensively today\nI think you're going to have a big game from the bangles\nAnd yeah could Tampa score a lot of points to make it a close game being contention to win it yeah absolutely because the bagels are banged up defensively as well but I just the Cincinnati rebounding at home\nI just don't trust Tampa at all and what their rash of injuries I'm just going with the home team on this one if you think about the home team typically getting three points\nIf their favorite by four you're basically saying ... one point favorite at home if you look at it that way I'm guilty must have within the as a one point favorite at home I ... I Do\nI Do too and and I my line has a bank fails given up three and a half to Tampa Bay today\nThe I've got it at four but again pointing to have no biggie no big deal right\nThank you thank you very much and look the Tampa Bay defense is is close to the bottom of the league so I think that they can roll with their with their receive is AJ green and Tyler boy but you know you don't know I'm Jim is with is filling up a lot of passes and a leading up a lot of yours\nAnd again I mean you talk about it it's not excused because as part of the game as part of football injuries and that thing goes defense has really been banged up and I don't see them really doing much defensively so we'll see what happens it could be a high scoring game I see I didn't like the Bengals I think that they must have more weapons on all things I really do\nYeah I Do too I uh I\nAnd that game was ugly they lost thirty three Eighteen they've been pretty darn close I'm taking the giants to beat the Redskins today in the game in New Jersey I like the giants today although I'm Still thinking it's time to move on from Eli Manning but the point is this who do you move to that's the question\nRight yeah you just don't have that that are up and coming quarterback that ... I ... you know fourth round pick he hasn't been an act he hasn't been active [laughter]\nYou know fourth round pick has been an act he has been active for a lot of games a year\nOr so yeah it's going to be Eli by process of elimination\nBut you might be right on this pick ... that man that just read it just seems like such a sucker line doesn't it or they get like wouldn't Vegas put their arm around you and they're like hey buddy hey would you like some spending cashier how about the Redskins huh\nOnly a point and a half they were to get the job you know how bad the giants have better diets goodbye Adelson\nIs just the start trying to do you a favor with the line that's where I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa I Know Vegas doesn't do favors and with the wind is low for the red skins who are clearly the better team I got big time questions here\nI'm with you right there and say what you look at the rich because you don't know what team what shows up first of all the pretty darn good at home but this was in a way game but you lose it the Indianapolis early in the season and then you'd be Green Bay the following week you just don't know what team shows up that's the problem with this Redskins team\nYeah and they haven't scored a touchdown in the third quarter\nFor eleven straight games isn't it amazing ... straight we know that the third quarter is typically the lowest scoring quarter\nBut eleven straight games not one touchdown think about all the drive all the flu the things that could happen in a special teams ... nothing no touchdowns it's amazing to me\nBut they're gonna have to\nFigure it out and be consistent on a week to week basis because they've had a couple of nights performances\nThey held Christian McCaffrey ... Elliott two combined fifty four yards rushing the last two weeks it's really good so they should be tough to get sick one Barclay and if you make them one dimensional and Eli Manning is under Senate you've got a great chance but this does seem like a sucker bat I wouldn't bet it is\nBut if I had to choose I Would still go with Washington to win the game\nAnd I ... I guarantee you one thing I bet you that this game will not be included and you'll be three on those picks\nI Know it just reeks it just reeks of a truck or bad and I just I cannot in good faith go with the G ... yeah I just can't do it can't be one of my three picks I could go with something else that's much better I didn't think it would be\nTrying a different way of life with a guy called Fox Sports radio studios but there's never a line on this game but it's the best of the day to find a barrel betting just freaking next [noise] around\nThe red Sox won gave away from another championship time to panic Dodger fan do you go to blame this one I Andrew Freedman analytics when it comes to the world series\nWe've got a chart on Fox Sports radio\nAll the different that's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans Dr Saper Michelin premium white ... designed with exclusive smart likes to ... or ...

car insurance ... why\nFor a free rape quote Dutch wife Cherie is the hardest work do you manage your business today my friend my top my part of the male with a brain that this out but working seven days a week to inform you for the very best to sports proud to have a beer the one and only Brian oh be quiet\nDoing great Andy ferman I'm I'm very fiery today because I was watching the lake show last night just all of a sudden fight night broke out over there at staples between the lake\nJust all of a sudden fight night broke out over there at staples between the Lakers and the rockets you see that with Ron do and\nHe and Chris Paul ... he has very soft fight the fresh face yeah you know that's I think my favorite of yours\nSee your face to face I could see a guy's\nGiving an elbow shoving maybe even sub or even the guy basketball\nBut to me when you spit and the guy's face on the street on a gay during the game but on a subway or whatever it may be that is the lowest form of life you could ever do this written the guy's face that he lied said he didn't do a book Chris Paul was wiping the spin off his face if they try to punch them back\nIt was yeah I I couldn't believe it or being in your face you go\nSomeone spits in your face [noise] it's a it's an invitation to catch hands like that's the way it is and also when Chris Paul when you put a finger your face that that's when you get blessed with the hands as well so I can understand why\nBoth uh players were picked up the one thing I don't understand is why Brandon Ingram pushed James Harden and the first place I don't understand that was a complete overreaction\nBut yeah you can be frustrated but you don't go like shoving people and get tossed in the process so it was just melt down by Brandon Ingram well\nThe good news is I mean if people are LeBron haters out there and there are plenty of those uh this takes away from the old one to record the Lakers have at this point in time because they're talking about the fight and the occasion rather than the fact that the Lakers are all went to right the right as it goes so lucky for LeBron in a sense\nWell a little bit yeah but it it's going to take a little while to jail and Andy trust me I don't want to do a whole thing on the Amy Schumer deal and the ... stuff and all that but I just want to say this 'cause Sammy K brought this up in Bronx talk\nAt all I Want to say this when she's basically saying white players need Neal or they're complicit and blah blah blah\nIt's like dude I we really this stupid because ... your point is until you Neil you're not supporting the goal right or you just ... right now but I don't really think about that Andy like how many black players in the NFL\nHave not taken a neat does that mean that they're against being treated better in this country of\nSo why does not want to Ask Amy Schumer that question say any you know if they're not nearly does that mean they're not supportive I may ask age some investigative report or someone on my on those news talk entertainment shows entertainment tonight ask her that question instead of the gods ... question asked that question and see what she has\nTo say and you know if you don't show that it's summertime lately that I could care less\nI yeah ... it's a dodge and idiotic take where it's like a less you Neal you are not supporting the end of racial injustice really right I don't see the logic in that maybe that completely wrong maybe that's what it is\nWell I'll tell you I Am supporting my guy Jim Harbach I liked him how he got a lot of heat and all of a sudden he needed when yesterday against Michigan stay here to the game yesterday against Michigan State or the record of one in five as MSU and Ohio State now all the world rings have to do is be Penn State and two weeks\nAnd then November twenty fourth play Ohio State so you know what this opening day last Notre Dame looks better every single week there's no today is undefeated\nAnd Jim harbor right now late it on Michigan State yesterday twenty wants to seven I'm happy to hear by the way it wasn't a game with a lot of points but it felt like Michigan was in control most of the way this is what it sounded like well Michigan jumped ahead in the third quarter to take a listen\nPatterson football factory pro were thrown throwing be found the right\nSide\n\nHave you on that seven and one will hit a hard time saying Michigan\nWas a touchdown man who wrote it sounded like [laughter] I'm by the way though Andy how about this in terms of total yard itch\nMichigan gave up Ninety four yards\nTo Michigan State Ninety four yard that that is great the fence and Michigan state's off and you gain Ninety four yards you could literally gain that in one derive gain that for the game that's a beat down right there man well\nThis is not a good Michigan State team I Know that held the night before us but also in Michigan State did not have a convert any of the twelve third downs they had all day yesterday this is not a good Michigan State team and I I tell you what I'm losing any sleep over it because I think what happened last year with what happened with those players that amazes me that marked Antonio is still there as\nCoach didn't they get rid of the president the president's gone the athletic director is gone but he remains that\nTo me is amazing but that's a story for another day\nYeah yeah it is I just want to hear that final call again Andy from and listen to me again with the wind [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] it it doesn't sound as bad when you isolated it's just when you hear the whole call\nBut I'll say that Sandy I don't want to overreact to the other way when it comes to a gym Harbaugh\nAnd what you mean by that is sometimes our opinions are more of a reaction than an opinion because Jim ... has been getting crushed\nFor losing too many games based on what his contract he earns all of these things\nHe just hasn't had the success there at at Michigan he hasn't fared well against Ohio State we know that he's had a couple of big losses skins Michigan State yadda yadda so I don't want to then all of a sudden with Jim Harbaugh rattling off seven straight wins and writing the ship I don't want to make it sound like\nA like a gym but this is what Jim Harbaugh was paid to do he's supposed to take down teams like Michigan State so I don't think that we should go above and beyond that just because some of the critics have gone above and beyond nailing him when they have an ... do well you know what I'm saying\nYou said something very interesting because I pick up on every word you say because it's worth listening to that is by God gave me two years in one mouth because I listen you said that he's getting a lot of heat yes he is because of the money he's been paid in the contract he has\nI agreed to some extent but are you telling me that if he got paid less money or some other schmuck was coaching Michigan not well not a big name my car by making less money will not get that heat I disagree I think\nMichigan has that history of football and they're supposed to be Michigan State which is an arch rival of theirs\nSo it doesn't make a difference how much money he's making maybe the more money well if you make a lot more ... look look at the we talked about that with the grueling situation ... absolutely right I mean but he's not getting the heat that heart bars getting because he hasn't been there is all I I don't know the\n... you think that Steve Wilkes with the Arizona Cardinals is getting the same amount of heat is John ...\nNo ... such a bad team you know going in there will be a bad\nTeam to Arizona has a worst record already there one in six words NFL ... okay how about the forty niners cows Shanahan getting a ton of heat right now I Know that Jimmy ... down to pass the test because if they get a pass you know as well as I Do the main\nLadies we need to

I mean I'm not going to say he's an upper echelon wide receiver but he's at least capable\nRight he's at least capable of making some noise on any given Sunday so I think it's more than just Cam Newton in Christian McCaffrey granted those guys are the bulk of the ... I don't think it's the entire often but you go against the number two rushing defense in football that's what's Philly has they give up about eighty or per game\nSo if they're able to slow down to Carolina off and that average is five yards perk Harry and put it all in the hands of Cam Newton that's going to be tough if you make any off one dimensional with the Phillies pass rush\nAnd that theme is throwing the ball and that's the only way they can gain yards man that's a tough tough team to beat and the eagles have one third in the past Fifteen at home as well\nYou know and me I I look at this game I I think the over under was like forty four forty five points I don't think they're going to score the others could be a low scoring game for some reason maybe I just with the defense on the on the Russian side of the ball with Philadelphia and maybe weather conditions which I don't know right now but I Know in the east coast is kind of dance\nAnd it could be wet so I I think they're not going to pass the ball as much as they would so I I don't think that over on the line I think it's going to be way under that I really do I think it'd be a low scoring game\nYou might be right might be it's tricky when you get forty five you start thinking about it it's a twenty four Twenty one ball game you know right that's not high scoring so in today's NFL if you're trying to get under forty five you don't have to have a team scores you know like thirty eight points to have a chance\nForty five is relatively right in the middle in terms of an NFL total so we'll see that Philly off and they looked a lot better last week against the giants and again\nIt was the giants so I Want to see what they do against the Carolina Panthers today because that Carolina Panthers defense they can make you one dimensional as well when they slow down you're running game\nSo we'll see if Carson when who seems to be regaining his his form from last year if he keeps going in that direction that not an easy often to slow down either even though it's musical running backs at this point\nI'm going to quote the great Brian no because I remember a lot of the things to say most of the things they do say this is a tremendous gain more so for the eagles and the Panthers should they lose today they've got to do what you will always tell me a lot of teams do they get real tight yeah real type because there'll be three and four and then they'll be looking like they have to when they have\nTo win and and an end to the press will be on building the pressure that they receive from the media will be unbelievable that you'd be right that they may not be headed back to the playoffs as a Super Bowl returning team that you know they'll just be out of it now next week they go to London of all places like jak civil dental by\nAnd then it doesn't get an easy because he got Dallas New York then they've got a little bit of a respite with the giants again so this is a tremendous game for them but really is more so the Carolina they lose today\nThey may have to pack it in I hate to say that and you'll be right they lose today I think it's over\nBut you're right it's a big time game because that's a tough schedule and that was one of the main reasons where I said I don't see in them being a playoff team because they're the team everybody's gunning for as the defending champ\nI just I don't know I I really [laughter]\nYeah well you might not have to trust them that could be the good news is the Detroit running defense is so bad you might get a heavy dose of Frank Gore and Kenyans rate today and take a lot of that pressure off of all the O's plate you know\nSo I I agree with you I think that the lions probably come in after a by I think they probably get a road when I I don't love it I Love the over more than anything more than picking the game I think there's going to be a lot of points scored today I Would take the ...\nFor more than anything more than picking the game I think there's going to be a lot of points scored today I Would take the over forty six and a half I Love taking the over\nIn these games and the heat Andy because you just the defenses will we look at the bears when they're trying to tackle Elvis Wilson last week\nSo amazing and you saw the Kenyan Drake fumble at the goal line that the bears recovered a team Hicks on the sideline big defensive lineman he would doubled over he's just like like suck you in a win meant it is so slow\nThat again\nThat was the key mixed on the sideline it's hard to play good defense in heat like that so I Would take the over in this one more\nThan anyone he mentioned that because we first start discussing this game you talked about maybe Detroit going from a dome it to the elements of people assume elements his reign when snow or whatever it may be heat but remember also and I got to believe that players of players and like Miami has to handle those elements to even though they are the whole\nTeam they have to play in the heat I mean ... there's going to be easier for them because they're they're bit defensive lineman after playing that as well so we'll see if they will [noise] right\nYeah there are a little bit more used to it obviously there are a lot more used to it but that doesn't mean it's easy so even if you're used to it it's it's not a walk in the park so yeah that Detroit often and especially you think about this past rushing if it's passed\nHeavy and you're having great success and you're able to keep Matthew Stafford clean and it's tough to to not will if you're constantly trying to rush the pastor or play pass the fence what have you ... it's just really tough to play good defense and the heat\nBrian no Andy firmly colas Fox football Sunday or by the way for free

five I'm going to do with clumps of Notre Dame and LSU\nA M well ... yeah I think Clemson followed by Notre Dame I think that's going to be the top four right what use that I think will be the case then yeah and I you probably have to have goodness you'd think LSU vaults that high asked\nThat question there was thirteenth going into the game is to going from Thirteen to five is a big jump so I I don't know if that could happen but twelve range of things have happened\nYeah and you look at it I mean gosh if you compare\nA schedule is if you compare LSU to UCS for instance people I bang on UCF because they should be banned gone [laughter] they just don't have a good body of work that that was the first thing they play that has a winning record this year was yesterday beating Memphis\nIs it one by one thirty one thirty right that this is what you got so should LSU be ranked ahead of UCF abs so Lou ... no doubt about it and then you look at these other teams that have lost\nWhen you talk about um let's see here West Virginia went down Washington goes down Penn State goes that do go six seven eight are down so essentially LSU would have to they're not going to vote over Michigan where parents are going to do that they could they could with Michigan beat down Wisconsin\nI could see that there are certainly going to jump Oklahoma who was off\nThey should you were talking to LSU they should jump Oklahoma they should jump UCF\nI should jump Texas they she survives at home against Baylor at LSU has a better better body of work right now than Texas does yeah yeah\nAnd I tell you what I I think it also goes now with the most recent gay but how you're trending and you look at Penn State that was right they they lost to straighten pillows two straight by giving it up I choking up in the fourth quarter and I think that they're going to be out of the top ten for sure Penn State\nOh yeah there's they have no say it'll be it'll be like Eighteen this week\nYeah it probably I I'll say a I'll give you the ... the lions seventeenth let's make it interesting Hugo Eighteen I go Seventeen\nHow about yourself and then he's going in Oregon with this week Oregon probably moved to like fourteenth\nMaybe or are they they go higher than that I think they sneak into a I think they're above the teens out that\nThink they'd get would lead twelfth\nYou don't want it it's getting very interesting the pictures getting a little clearer right now Michigan I think Michigan lose it to the top ten with that went over what's\nCalled ... with everybody always willing sure yeah\nSo Michigan's good I'm happy for Michigan right them at Michigan State or\nA big win over Penn State I mean I didn't expect that in Texas so Baylor but they struggled to beat Baylor so you know there's so many things going on a lot of these I hate to use the term moving parts but there are split it all works out at the end it all it all comes together but I tell you the biggest shock us they had to be LSU\nI mean LSU beating Georgia the way they did and Georgia made everybody was looking at Georgia now we know they're not for real it it's not the same team that was there last year over the national title their their their phone is their fates they're frauds that's what they are those are frauds\nCome on man they lost to a tough team on the road Baton Rouge Death Valley it's tough place to play and no I didn't think that they would lose by twenty points but you can't say that they're complete fraud that's a theme that legitimately made it to the national championship game\nAnd was a whisker away from winning it\nSo I don't think that there are complete fool's gold or anything like that I think that they have a really really tough road ahead of them and I don't expect them to run the table from here on out that's what it's going to take to get them into the play off\nI don't see them beating Florida at Kentucky Auburn S. E. C. championship game mostly are most likely against Alabama [laughter] I just don't see them running that table to get to the college football playoff well\nI'm Still behind my national defending national champion UCF because they were done their job even at the opposite say got a flag you did that for a leg or you just try to get a rise out of it I\nWas not one dollar route far but at the bottom of the hour they give you a little jab as well a little ... little ...\nOver the so called\nPaper champs UCF and they're terrible conference and their worst non conference schedule I I just have no love no love for it's not personal with UCF it's any team who trumpet themselves who pat themselves on the back\nAnd you're playing no one like that you play in South Carolina state that's an F. C. S. school\nOr when is it when there's when no way that it is not just jazz but yet that's all I Know you I don't what is this what is\nLike if you're telling me that LSU taking down the number two ranked team in the country at home is the same thing is UCF what taking down in Memphis it's not saying\nIt's the same garbage we had two years ago a western Michigan it was it the same thing with them right\nYeah they ran into a table in nine late no one neighbor Ralph\nExactly right we move on and let's talk a little NFL right now but as I said that this team likes to dramatic I'm Talking about the Cleveland Browns they loved her dramatic they went into overtime for the third time in five weeks they beat the ravens I was shocked with that title nine I didn't watch the game and thank goodness I didn't ... that\nHad to be asleep at twelve to nine are you kidding great Joe civil to thirty seven yard field goal browns\nThough are now too and wants to take a may feel took over a quarter back they have five games have been decided by a total of Thirteen points to today they hosted charges in Cleveland charges three into they beat Oakland last week\nAnd miles Garrett of the browser defensive end is averaging the soccer game and I'll tell you what I like the browns today I liked the browns today they're coming of age I really believe that\nI don't [laughter] I'm going to go the other way on this one Andy I liked the chargers you look at the chargers first off we're out of September so that's good for them because they invent ways to lose games in September and you look at the teams that they've lost two they've lost the chiefs and the rams\nThat as soon as the charges it was too [laughter] and they had a disappointing game against the forty niners because they showed up thinking that they didn't have to face Jimmy ... low ... CJ bad third who cares well when it was well after the effort but they looked a lot better against they bad raiders team\nThat paralyzed veterans of America they gave me an outlet to my career now they\nFocus on the accessibility for our life they helped me get to the point where I'm at now where I can have a job I have a family to be a part of society and live life the way I Want to live life\nTo support our work visit the V.

Y.\nUCF has to play who's in their conference\nMy guess is every college program except Alabama would take McKenzie Milton as their quarterback thinks got frost knows that UCF hung forty five ... indeed struggled wouldn't want to play UCF in a bowl game ask Auburn there is so much wrong with the\nI don't know where to begin Andy how much time we have here maybe we shouldn't even begin you know I'm no no we have is began because here's the thing is there's a reason why\nThere's like a college football\nPlayoff ... does he also rans okay I I make fun of it and hopefully maybe he bought into what I have to say maybe unbelievable there's no way of God's green earth that those players could play a major college football because in my mind is not major college football it's not it's good football but it's not big on football sorry\nWell I think that I Would disagree with that they have a a decent amount of players that could play major college football\nSo I I don't agree with that but I'm not going to grade on a curve I hate this logic of hey that's why I used to play use in their conference\nBut if they play in a bad conference I'm not going to act as if it's a good one okay you can't give a team of free pass for playing in a week conference will\nThey ... there's no way time out to patch wells are bad conference that's a bad\nThing American athletic conference bad no no I didn't know that hey just added Sylvia comics but they've got they've got a break they did get a break and UCF didn't get the break last year\nReally top to bottom the patch twelve stunk last year\nSo what do you go to conferences okay right in\nBig deal who cares ... were hot August ... conference the oldest kid was any team in the past ... will get a break over any team of the AC who's email that I Know that ball playoff\nLast year ... Washington which is in the playoffs during the past twelve\nAnd they had a better body of work than anything that you're seeing from UCF right now\nNow I don't understand the point like I don't know why is that your talking conferences okay and I'm Glad that you you could have a team\nSo I don't know why is that you're talking conferences okay and I'm Glad that you could you could have a team and and I've been a big name conference a one or two losses doubled the brake head and shoulders over a team from the why is that why you that I used a play yeah whoa delve of course if the\n... the resume that you have if your resume say the two teams of Georgia and Alabama who made it from the SEC last year they had respectable resume they had a better body of work\nThan it seemed like UCF largely because UCF plays in a bad conference so don't give me that hey hey they play who's in their conference so they have to do that yeah great and I'm going to take that into account if I'm a value waiting which team deserves to be and the college football playoff in which team doesn't\nThink the other day in their right to give a hand out in a free pass to someone who plays in a week conference\nThere's no doubt but I Would say this I think the conference situation a is a misnomer it should be who you play not the conference here because you can play schools outside of you accomplished all your schedule we knew seems like you know like look at the Washington schedule the path towards they go out of their coverage of play crap they do like garbage okay\nThey played all have written this year that's a good is a big way way better than anything UCF does non conference wise\nThere's no doubt about that way that the UCF could if they wanted to go out of Congress to play two or three schools to bolster their conference I had a resume right of course his colleagues do was Alabama will still play chattanooga's southern out of their conference they couldn't afford to do that because they play in the U.S conference of the country\nAbsolutely everything about McKenzie Milton in terms of what these other point my guess is every college program except Alabama would take McKenzie Milton as their quarterback I disagree with that but take a guy like will Greer with West Virginia he's fantastic did you see him yesterday\nThrough for a hundred yards at Iowa State\nSo to think that just because you have a good quarterback oil will love you use the no no no it doesn't work like that okay and it in terms of evaluating what one team does against the common opponent versus another team yeah use the F they crushed pit Notre Dame struggled against it yesterday\nThat all of a sudden means that Notre Dame wouldn't want to play UCF in a bowl game are you crazy right they would and I went to the mighty UCF nice to get fat off of these week teams like the these teams are just about how ring in fear because of the UCF mighty unite the show is\nA mistake that the the Twitter\nAuthor made tweeting to you about this\nYou talk to any one of those players and they may have a chip on their shoulder and they play a higher level football than they should because they do it that chip on their shoulder because they were overlooked by the schools that they really want them to go to Sharon they didn't want to go to UCS\nThey wanted to go to schools like UCLA USC Texas Oklahoma those are the schools that they wanted to go to and they were overlooked so when you hear these announces saying well he's playing with a chip on his shoulder why because he was overlooked that he ended up how to use the F that's why\nWell yeah and it applies to the bowl win over Auburn\nAuburn loses the S. E. C. championship game to Georgia and their consolation prize\nIs facing UCS\nOf gay ... it's a completely different mind that it's a completely different motivational factor there\nFor Auburn versus UCF like you're talking about they were overlooked for the big schools there in the sugar bowl they're playing ... let's go let's go time baby that's what it used the EPA's thinking Auburn like damn\n... we had a chance for the national championship we had a chance to be in the college football playoff and we blew it by losing the Georgian the SEC championship game you know you got this game against UCF it's totally different so to highlight that and say oh ask all burnt look at what they did you're taking everything\nThat should be into account and you're not applying it to what factors into that game and the mind that both teams heading into it that matters if you're trying to trumpet use the F as taking down anybody in the country right now when it comes to the college football playoff it's crazy\nI agree and speaking of ... this is talk about the Chicago Bears the bears are Brian knows three into the office today\nAnd why I say if the gays is because the last time the bears quarterback which will ... played he had already record setting day in the past ... bucks forty eight ten Hindu for three\nI couldn't agree more I I think that it's almost a waste a breath to discuss why a team on that level should be I I just put on the same level as an Alabama or LSU it just just put it this way put UCF\nOr a South Florida and the SEC I put a complete schedule your schedule there if they want to games will be a lot to be a lot [laughter]\nSchedule your schedule there if they want to games will be a lot will be a lot [laughter] it's All right do you agree no way\nThere is no way they would be in contention for a playoff berth if they had as as though that looked like Georgia's schedule Andy imagine\nI mean you mean like I'm the one that's kind of grazing the flight for UCF look\nI think it's a joke I make fun of it the fact that the athletic director they got a flag to say that defies shy of its rebuild for him who have to do what they are that\nThis is what they are anti UCF is a poor man's version of Boise State that's what they are memorable in Boise State yeah headed cranked up and they were added ... undefeated season ... one last the ...\nProgram at the level that they're playing\n... here's the thing you have to say boy they played in a week conference at the time the ... week\nProbably better than the a C honestly but so we conference but what they did they went out of conference and they lead to played a big time team they play someone who was ranked they play any power five team where they got lucky with that at all ... yes doesn't do that\nThey are a weak version of Boise State when that program was at its finest that's what you guys are much\nThank you very much I Want to welcome everybody to the FEC puts radio studios what brought you a bike oh it's easy to say fifty percent of moral car insurance was Geico got a guy go duck comical eight hundred and I put up with all the all the hard part figuring out which way is usually by the way you mentioned the fact that the Vikings are playing today and they're playing\nArizona hosted by the way hosting Arizona wanted for Vikings two to one and they did break that ... game losing streak last week and it was a a rematch of the NFC championship game\nAnd I guess the highlight of that game last week that I remember that defensive tackle liberal Joseph stole the show but at twenty three Twenty one when he recovered a ... here and this big monster of a man rent fifty for us to the end zone and the Vikings one of the ball game\nI Love that great got some agility man it's crazy how guys in the NFL that big can move that well so amazing man but really how about his Madden rating going up by twelve points on that and this was crazy he had the top in speed\nThat was almost neck and neck with marches may remember Marta made the jets yeah ... yes who almost had to return for a touchdown they topped out at almost the exact same speed\nLoophole Joseph was about twice the size of marches debate that is amazing right there but yeah I just don't see how the Vikings drop another one at home I think they're going to be on high alert because they walked in thinking they could just show up and beat the bills and they lost by three touchdowns so I don't think they make that same mistake against the\nArizona Cardinals team with Josh Rosen pleaded Jesus facing that defense I think that defense gets the better of Josh Rosen today I think the toughest heads for that Arizona off when they're thirty first in rushing the ball and also stopping the rush that is a bad
