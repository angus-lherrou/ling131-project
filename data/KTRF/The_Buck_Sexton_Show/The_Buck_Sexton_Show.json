Corey Lewandowski urine about five minutes see was the campaign manager for Donald Trump for like a year and a half\nAnd I'm going to ask him about the immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight looks to me like all hell breaks loose and ABC and NBC and CNN thinks this is the vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks in two days to bring down the Republicans in the Congress and I say all contrary mon forever I Believe\nThe three reasons Trump got elected was number one the economy number two immigration number three federal judges here's performed magnificently and all three areas\nAnd I think this is the October surprise that will think the Democratic party come or the next sixteen days let's continue with more blood becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up in about five minutes or recording Lewandowski top of the next our way of Kevin ... near the blacks we're\nTo talk about why he was like oh by Fox and the impact in the black community of illegal immigration good at the bottom of the last hour we're going to have on a report and Peter Wallison who's written a book about the deep state the fourth branch of\nGovernment which is the bureaucracy so continuous more Cunningham the great American\nWhy would you ever been in\nAnd they asked her do you think that relationship was inappropriate\nAnd less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult\nHe was the president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband behavior can you imagine for one second and that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with older and the media would be saying oh\nYeah they would give them an excuse drawing away and I'm sure the media would say well she's an adult no big deal I mean the doubles\nOr the media would say well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nHas always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you've referenced as it relates to Brett those Ninety two percent of the media coverage of this president's\nNegative now I Would accept that if we were in the middle of twenty five percent unemployment a national crisis all over the place nobody working and the country moving in the wrong direction growing at point zero zero percent I Would expect that but we're not we are we are now back up on top where the most competitive country in the world again\nFor the first time in ten years and there is no credit for what the president's done let alone the twenty Americans who've been held hostage in other countries that he got return not one plane loads of cash to our palette loads of money but on his own share when we do to get these people back\nYou know you saw a ... the pastor come back just a week or so ago and\nThat was a it was a blip on the radar screen the president has gotten twenty Americans either in North Korea or an Egypt or wherever they have been home that's part of his job and he gets no credit for that but in the mainstream media Brock Obama would have been in line for another Nobel Peace prize\nWell let's talk a little bit about what's happening in Honduras in Guatemala there's\nAt least three thousand the numbers are growing coming from a Honduras through Guatemala into Mexico and the mainstream media hate\nThis kind of an issue percolating\nA little over two would come from the election because it reminds the American people one of the main reasons Trump was elected was to curtail illegal migration from Central America and Mexico into our country\nThere's a I like Google this information there is a hundred and fifty million Mexicans watermelons Hondurans in El Salvador and hundred and fifty million don't like to come to America if you throw in Venezuela and Colombia maybe Peru\nA Europe wide Paraguay I were talking to a hundred and fifty million\nA central and South American would love to come to America at what point is enough is enough and the mainstream media does not want to call it illegal immigration they talk about refugee status they talk about the factors moms and dads and children there in strollers\nHowever uh four or five months ago I fell off the couch one night I'm watching sixty minutes and sixty minutes did a report on the reality of our southern border hundreds of dead bodies are found and the deserts of northern Mexico because men are killed\nBecause they will become drug meals and that when these individuals paying MS Thirteen literally millions of dollars to transport them from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador and Mexico into America when this is funding and fueling MS Thirteen dry\nTo make literally hundreds of millions of dollars\nEvery county so to speak they pass through in Mexico has the drug war ... somebody in charge of that county and that men have got to pay with money and women have to pay their body and sixty minutes made the point that the majority of young girls and women are raped on the way from Central America\nTo to the United states and when it's report it which is not done by the mainstream media that this has been extremely dangerous route that men are murdered and that women are raped and brutalized all the way up Fifteen hundred miles\nAnd then when they get a new American ... they're they're not released many times you go work in a brothel and off an Austin you go to Baton Rouge and working abroad or if you're a man you sent you stand on street corners to sell drugs\nWhich is paying back your transit seat there there was one report on sixty minutes about the reality of what the Democratic Party's encouraging and it was disgusting why don't we have more media coverage Corey Lewandowski campaign manager for drum\nOf the reality of what happens to the men and women incentivized to come to this country because what happens to them it's still just pick up all the Democratic party should be held accountable for some of this why does the media cover it objectively\nThe media doesn't want to tell the real story they want to pretend that the only people who are coming to this country the porn impoverished that are seeking asylum and and look we're the greatest\nCountry in the world and not only did they two hundred and fifty million people from South and Central America want to come here people from all over the world want to come here but we're not a country if we can't control our borders or\nDon't Reagan said it you know Thirty years ago we are the greatest country in the world than the greatest privilege we can give somebody is to make them a citizen\nAnd there was a way to do that but just coming in and storming the borders doesn't work but your point is much more important what takes place with these people and they make this track from Honduras through Mexico and ultimately up to the U.S border is\nA disgusting display of gangs that take advantage of these people they raped women they kill them and and you're exactly right even\nIf they have the opportunity to make it into our country illegally\nAnd those people aren't free and we have to do something about human trafficking we have to make sure that it doesn't continue the best way to do that is you build a wall on the southern border\nAnd you say if you make it to the United states you know not make it into our country and they were they process to come here and you want to follow the process we're a nation of laws and what we will do as a Republican Party has to make sure that the immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\nHave all the tools necessary to apprehend people coming across the border illegally\nUnlike the Democrats who want to be fun and diligent them eyes the men and women who serve an ice everyday that protect us from the animals of MS Thirteen and those gangs\nCorey Lewandowski wide or the Democrats want this because there can be no change in the law\nUntil ten or so\nUnited States senators who are Democrats agree to the change would you build a wall\nBrings insanity I think we need temporary workers to come and go when you come you or do we know who you are you know we have a big wall with lots of doors in it\nAnd every legitimate person that wants to come here to to work whatever ought to be able to do it but the the the byproduct of that would it be do a lemonade drug a heroin and math in Cincinnati in Austin in Tampa in Milwaukee\nBy by doing it makes it more difficult for drugs to come in more difficult for him is Thirteen what is the real reason the Democratic party does not one controller southern border\nBecause they love the political issue and they don't want to resolve the issue and look this president went out and say you give me the money for the wall and all the people that are here through no fault of their own what's arguably called the dream where they came in through no fault of their own\nI Will give them the president said a pathway to citizenship and that was a long way to go for conservatives to be very honest with you there was a lot of consternation when he made that statement\nBut he gave the Democrats exactly what they've argued they've wanted for a long time\nAnd they said no we're not going to get that too and they want to have the political football they want to continue to make sure that the people coming across the border illegally and going to sanctuary cities and centuries states have the opportunity to vote we now see this in Texas and we've seen in other places that they are targeting individuals who are not us citizens\nAnd asking them to go and vote and they they are\n... bought and sold by the Democratic party those illegal immigrants coming in here and they want to keep that flow to continue it doesn't make sense to me is our first obligation is to the people in this country to make sure they're safe and secure and we\nAbsolutely need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come\nAnd we absolutely need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis\nBut you're exactly right it come through the system your check you are authorized to come in you pay whatever fair share it is there is either a vacation when your job is done you go back to your country that how it works that that was always work and we just need to know a better job of forcing that\nCorey Lewandowski lastly there's been some speculation that a Hillary Clinton is making a run and twenty twenty\nYou know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady she was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidate for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage\nHer to run I Would help her get signatures maybe raise the money for would you encourage Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic party's standard bearer standard bearer and twenty twenty would you do a great job\nOh we we would love this look in the right to vote for two years ago that number is only going down she wouldn't be up for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's re election effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred\nAnd what he beat Donald Trump\nBeat her by Seventy four electoral votes and what your listeners remember is with it and when they woke up ... twenty sixteen the New York times and all of those mainstream media outlets said it will require that Ninety nine percent\nChance of winning today we're going to get to ... percent of the only two people on the ballot so I Want her to run I run we want to\nGo back through all of her email scandal all of the money that she's gotten from foreign governments when she was a secretary of state in the Clinton Foundation and all the fact that she's lost her security clearance let's go re litigated all what's quarterback and for the

Can't imagine a worst representative and Debbie Stabenow and she's running against a a black Republican is going to get a lot of African American vote or not\nBut I Hope so although I did not vote for him because there were some things about him getting\nUm money to certain people that I didn't kind of agree with that because he was backed by Trump he got elected so um [noise]\nDo you know we have a Muslim lady hit back here that's running on a polish for Senate because she's from Detroit and it's largely Muslim now [noise] so um there's areas of Michigan like in Minnesota where [noise]\nUm we

where they want to go to just Thirteen people that will be picked by the secretary of state randomly\nLike random will be you know depending on whether the secretary of state is a Democrat or Republican [noise] and they're going to pick like Thirteen people for decided Republican and for decided Democrat\nRenters just look at John James I think John James has a shot at winning that seat it

diamond and so I Can't believe it's the woman's got to figure it out well why can't more blacks figure out what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them\nTo say I don't know and that's what I wanted this lady again oh why in the walls all this stuff though so I called it all the time and the other being held it's sad to free slaves not want that voted to free the slaves that Republicans are either\nOne of the Democratic donors white and the Democrats owned slaves and the Republicans tried to free them\nAnd then after the war the Democrats allege blacks and the Republicans tried to save them and now here we are in twenty Eighteen the Democratic party has destroyed African Americans and the Republicans like John drunk Donald Trump or saving them but ... but the media doesn't cover that why do they\nKnow they don't and I'm very upset because July ... ... ... this year I went to visit or who has cable and I heard a report\nOn land an alien and or at a ... a woman in front of her Thirteen butter on dragged her in the woods and that and killed her\nAnd I would not report that on the news you\nKnow that was a blackout oh I Know how do we ... that are killing Americans in our country\nAnd there is no group hurt more by illegal aliens then African American workers but this CNN's Don lemons in this world doesn't cover it that way because they're the\nMouthpiece for the modern Democratic Party there is no grew more hurt by legal oily and migration into America that African Americans\nThey're the ones hurt most part and poor white folk poor white for workers now most poor people in America are white and poor white folks are heard by two and they tend to vote disproportionally for Democrats it's unbelievable\nNot their flight girl but anyway you know I hated Obama I'd still hate and he's wicket and evil will turn the turn of the third world country up that at all\nTarget in the third world country up there that we have never had a president in the country that I can recall that oh I don't I Will try the following president\nOr president say wow I Can't he thought\nWell you know Patsy uh some are concerned that Obama and Clinton are back out campaign you might recall\nThat Obama said my name's on the ballot this is my third term Hillary's going to continue my policies and there were so roundly unpopular that as soon as the American people living in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Iowa Florida Texas\nHurt Obama's say vote for Hillary we've got four more years of my policy\nThat's what caused working class folks in these so called swing states to come out one hundred percent against Obama and against Hillary Clinton because as soon as they discovered you know what the Bible for Hillary I got four more years of Obama maniacs I Can't take it hell that's what Trump was elected\nAnd so of Hillary and or an Obama and Michelle whoever wants to go out and keep campaigning I go out there remind the American people

the one that they want to walk around car races that doing more for black people then but rock Hussein Obama you have president Donald Trump\nWho's looking out for people to bath interests making sure that they have job so that they can provide for their families and looking out for\nPeople that have been and justly wrong and looking out for people that's coming out of prison so that that can have a second chance the second opportunity at life president Donald Trump that bring these jobs\nBack here to American for Americans to work because the black president said those jobs will never come back and you have to be an individual to send jobs overseas and leave the American people over here broke and broken and no way for them to take and take care of their children\nI tell you what do when you look at what he said you might recall diamond\nBernanke Hussein Obama saying no jobs coming back man you can forget about it they're not coming up they just want because new trade deals with Canada trade deals with much you know the trade deals with South Korea the trade deals with Europe and the fact China's gonna fall under the Trump\nTrump page and the next job among those jobs back and they just don't get the sense that you know monthly African American under Trump won none of that does happen under Obama\nAbsolutely let's say you look at the unemployment rate on an all time low in the history\nOkay about African Americans look at the economic opportunity people are able to go out if you don't have a job you can create your job if they can become an entrepreneur or yes all the ship is up I'm an African American I mean some people want to thrive in this country\nAnd they are doing so not only that anthrax he also gave your tax cuts where you have more money in your pocket but I can look at the ... the Democrat Party back in the day they push the Jim Crow to suppress an old press today they try to push them to suppress it open and they think wait the American\nPeople are going to fall for it to the American people a man's\nBody that's going to wind up with the cars going to make sure that we live and we are able to look at the American dream and he told us that his loyalty and these are legal aliens and make sure that this country is that stopped them and make sure that they are\nSuction is making sure that they wish that we thought that America can no longer exists but wait wait until it was like nothing you've got to go the Democrats crossed the dot com tickets they put me on the fifth pain and the editors to\nGo get your tickets after I Want to show what they call these people do not do what the American people watch it do we go out the vote\nThem out and what we're doing is giving you the prove with the truth we're showing you exactly what's going on into the stuff that people don't want out there we diamond that silk is on a bit scream\nTrying to educate people and show you what you didn't miss and what you've been asleep too it's time for people to wake up you have the Democrats want to abolish ice but they didn't want to abolish slavery\nThat's that that's a shame and it should be ashamed of black people to be okay with the Democrats than we gonna do this we're going to give your stability we gotta get get that they was in office for a year\nWe're going to get your stability we gotta get get that they would end up at four years and what did they do for the black community\nAbsolutely not I don't know the non\nMilitary up this way if people do not know their history they're condemned to repeat it\nBack to party was the confederacy that declaring war in the United states of America the Democratic party wanted to keep slavery yeah I'm a crowded party was the party of Jim Crow back then hey how about lynching Lynch you\nKnow let me tell you something that people will pay it made it again thank God I Can't go to that politics [laughter]\nWhat can happen to the cabin and the problem with it that way and then I got the same man woman\nAnd wherever you are out of the hour we'll all get up and we probably\nSomebody [laughter] did that [laughter] and it's because they want but [laughter] like in order to dominate death right\nAnd look at it this way when I look at Republicans being shot like even as Phillies I'll look at a Republican run off the road a longer Republicans being dams and chased out of movie theaters in restaurants and bars and he's now the airport in elevators you know Rand Paul said the other day Senator Rand Paul's that somebody's going to get killed\nYeah you'd termination tactics have you to subvert intimidation hands a Democrat [laughter]\nOh no no no we need are kicking and I'll pick up my cocoa dollar I mean I'm going to get there you know we look at that point no paper and we can if you don't want to get that [laughter] than than when we want to fight them\nWe don't have to do with that with like a fight with that and and what\nAnd when you look at the Democratic party you see how they're telling people to go out and terrorize people actually to tell you the truth the Democrat Party should be deemed a terrorist group and I got out there telling people to her on a human being how Americans they shouldn't be the no party base it would be all deemed a terrorist group\nAnd still to look good Hillary Clinton said the other night she she said we must be on civil to Republican leadership for the modern Democratic Party Cory Booker Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton incentivizing encourage violence\nAgainst Republicans based upon their political beliefs don't you think the president should bend the FBI and others to people I Hillary Clinton then encourage violence against Republican\nWe act it\nLooked like they try to be a dictator
