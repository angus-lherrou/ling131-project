farmer Randy sours is including himself in that category too\nThere are so they asked me something wrong with somebody to deal with what we deal with every day for no more than we get out of it\nWe've all these forms three years ago\nI mean it's just going to be a burden on me and my kids\nBecause these are paid for it and that their kids you know decided to stay and farming in one of these days they might you know it gets better term right now the farms across the more we can make all of them are farmers drop the banks and to notice that last week with her clothes\nAll of them are farmers drop the banks and tend to notice that last week the foreclosures we've got a neighbor purely foreclosed on January\nIt's like land you know make farmers use lamb and farmers are born and raised and they know what to do and they have the heart to do it I mean most people know would even consider do we do and\nIt's seven days a week when you don't get a break\nFor Thirty years I've been doing this I've gotten up as early as eleven Fifteen night the milk or the way\nThat he just said get up at nights who gets up at and eat besides folks of course with night shifts but that's not Randy situation\nWell I Try to get to bed by seven or seven thirty\nPretty hard when it's still light outside but that's what I have to do\nEarly years and didn't have any help that wasn't didn't eleventh Fifteen but I get done about\nSeven or eight in the morning [noise]\nNon lethal ten o'clock [noise]\nThen get up and get back to work\nThe last Twenty years have been get up at midnight me and my wife and we will\nFirst shift the cows and we usually get back home about four o'clock we don't milk 'em all anymore but we do know first shift because while I found out over the years I depend on somebody else to go in there early they don't show up and then makes old big bad\nSide of the mothers to myself that way you get the day started people to [noise] you know come after me they better be there I'm going to go get them out of bed 'cause I Know where they are says we're retired in December we're about five mornings a week for the other day we do farmers market\nFor a nice those through the winter though because we don't have the one Sunday market through the winter I got sleeping on Sunday Morning\nSome idea of retirement and a couple of years ago his government shrine to throw him an early\nRetirement party\nSo we were [noise]\nHad a store on a farm or do farmers market were handled a lot of cash [noise]\nWe just deposited in the bank I always wonder whether the government should would show up some day when they were all the cascade from which doesn't bother you go to the news all legal so I didn't worry about too much pay taxes on it like anything else somebody we were causing and then the bank every week [noise]\n... I got every week made us better on something else that we are still in a more than ten thousand dollars but\nIt really didn't matter to them and they were pretty nice I guess nice they said you know we can see are legitimate business we really don't feel your lawn money longer drug dealer not like that but now says it's gone as far you have to go through the system in the ... and get your money back\nGone as far as their boss and then Marilyn us attorney Rod Rosenstein was already committed to the case and there's no way\nThat they thought that they could get him to back down on it a judge had already issued a warrant for the seizure of Randy's bank account Rand needs the money was this close to being there\nThat I was out a drug dealer lawn lawn or they just gave me my money back and say wait for my service to this country\nAnd I would have been end of it but they do they got your money and they want it and you know over this period of time [noise]\nIt's not the IRS and gets a lot of money at the local people then you know find this problem they get their cut to everybody gets their cut\nAs how they make their budget\nSo they take all that money away how they're going to pay it or you know all these uh things they get because all the structure [noise]\nAnd the department of justice in Maryland is particularly active in pursuing this structuring money in the fiscal year two thousand eleven Marilyn brought for teen of the nation Ninety nine structuring cases or ... percent of them\nEven though they only make up one point eight percent of the nation's population so supposedly Marilyn citizens or eight times more likely to be committing crimes than the rest of us or\nSomething else that's going on or raw they're frozen seeing it on the record as saying that anti structuring efforts are quote an increasing area the emphasis for the Justice Department and there\nHas been an influx of resources to investigate it dust I'd be disappointed if there was an uptick\nIn prosecution [noise]\nSo by lawyer called and\nWhoever the prosecutor was on the taste Rod Rosenstein actually was the\nBarbara justice in Maryland at the time I'd like to see him go to jail now go visiting but he called him\nOne of rods deputies\nHe said well that's the way it goes and we will ... will negotiate no or probably keep half that money you might have ... down some but you know\nAre we keep half that money and you might have your email and negotiate that down some but you know use the you know we'll negotiate some kind of a a deal\nTreating it all too casually like it's negotiating some thing\nAt a garage sale not thirty thousand dollars above businesses of families\nSomehow I don't know how\nIt all came down but there was another lawyer showed up\nAnd he'd been working on the structure thing for a long time but they all told me you know keep my mouth shut and not tell anybody about it\nI think all these papers but when I went to the farmer's markets that weekend everybody knew that the governments told my money everybody woke up and say well now I Know how we goes I told him the story\nAnd they are where they they couldn't believe it [noise]\nSo it wasn't too long after that that uh [noise]\nI got a call from Baltimore city paper and he was questioned about you know this\nBecause he saw the docks come out of federal court in Baltimore\nAnd I said you know I'd love to tell you the story but my lawyer said what do you get this thing's settled\nOut better just not say nothing except for the government wanted everybody say nothing so they can still your money and nobody knows what's going on so he said well you know that's the way you want to look at it but I'm going to do the story and do look good on your part far right from what the government says\nSo his government allowed to speak about him but they say that he's not allowed to respond\nBecause people already thought we'd done something wrong I mean everybody her her parents thought we had done something wrong I think my parents my to do it done something wrong\nThen so I told him the whole story\nWhen we got our settlement papers you know we knew from the\nCase on the eastern shore with a\nTailor family who knew what their settlement was the last one was different housing method I did something wrong in the settlement now and then do it\nSo I'm a lawyer call them\nHe says because your client went to the press and they send us an email it said it\nRosen teens deputy Stefan ... actually out an email that they were treated differently because quote un Mr Taylor did not give an interview to the press admitting as\nClear as day that the government is acting according to a rule of vengeance not according to the American promise solve the rule of law\nSo he said it wasn't going to do me any negotiating you know they were keeping a close to thirty thousand dollars and it was it into the ocean ... miles as I went to the press [noise]\nIf we were fought him\nThey would have got\nTo the whole three hundred and sixty thousand dollars away the causes and checking account that here so that was another thing they were holding against dissident fight is that you know you're not going to win and they were going on three hundred and sixty thousand dollars [noise]\nThis is what you call black male\nEither pay us thirty thousand or going to come after you for more three hundred and sixty thousand and by the way fighting us in court will cost you a lot more than thirty thousand so you might as well just pay us right now\nA pretty good business to be in if you or the government they can do this all day\nLong [noise] and do but not a great business proposition if you're Randy and Karen especially when you're trying to do your actual his sense of farming [noise] it's a no win situation for them if they lose\nNo matter what [noise]\nSo this hour has decided to forfeit the thirty thousand dollars of their sees the money to the government\nAnd tried to move on with their lives [noise]\nBarbeque a lot of time to go out and fight and\nSurely can't fight the government\nBut in the meantime there's two for justice had been working on some of these cases\nAnd our main contact with them and they came out we had a meeting\nBut says cases already settled they just\nReally wasn't a whole lot they can do [noise]\nAnd when we come back we're going to hear what happens when liberty lawyers get involved in that sort of the Institute for justice his lawyers are they protect people's property rights from the government and always remember why the constitution was formed as we all know that most of our cops and prosecutors are good guys\nBut the bad ones and boy there were some bad ones here folks [noise] and you know it right\nThe law on behalf of the citizens starts to take action [noise]\nBrandy salary story here\nOn our American stories here although we do sort of our American network dot org give us your email address and we will

like the rest of us\n[noise]\n\nBack\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\nYou hear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place which students study all the things that matter in life\nAll the things that are beautiful in life and I know I teach there every year for a couple of weeks\nAnd then we have some in Hillsdale sinus come here and tell their own story and produce

chilled\nTo the nonprofit\nKids will do for justice of the bunch a young lawyers are concerned about this country [noise]\nUh met a good many oh and they all have the same outlook\nAnd they're not out there\nTo make a lot of money I have no idea how much money they make I don't care most all the money comes in donations from people that like what they say and not people like me 'cause I don't have a lot of money to give up I mean people think I have a lot of money I mean so now live in a big house but\nYou know the house came with a land we both are they really want the house it's too big that's why I'm living in just two of us because nobody does want to live in it [noise]\nBut you know the\nPeople what people think about farmers is is ridiculous because they think you're rich because you've got big machine calls a lot of money and that's why you're not rich because you've got to have those machines to do what you do [noise]\nAnd great work has always Alex\nBy the way a major bank CEO confidentially told us that the government has essentially force them into being their own private snooping army with their compliance department selling to mind their customers accounts\nFor what the government might deem suspicious activity giving them no choice but to report many innocent citizens like Randy's hours to the government for investigation\nThe c._e._o. said that this force snooping sweeps up former information than anything that the NSA did related to phone records and yet has received almost zero attention and that's what we're doing here in our American stories bringing this story to your attention\nIs also a big problem selective prosecution you're the government has seized the bank accounts of innocent farmers like Randy sours but refused to charge politicians like former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer who was actually guilty of structuring his payments to prostitutes and you bet he knew which structuring was\nThis bipartisan legislation out their folks and it's sponsored by Democrats like congressman Sheila Jackson Lee and Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz and that doesn't happen too often so that's how bad this prosecutorial abuse is folks\nOf course that would change the statute so that you can't be charged for a crime that you\nDon't know is a crime it's called men's rare folks it's the heart of criminal law if you don't know what crimes that crime you can't be charged\nWith it this is Lee Habib Randy shower story and thank goodness for the Institute for justice looked him up folks give them some

Edwards with a story [noise]\nMost Americans are at least somewhat familiar with the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright\nEven if by some chance you don't know his name you've seen and probably admired his work on a calendar oriented magazine born in Eighteen sixty seven he designed over a thousand structures [noise] five hundred thirty two of which were completed\nRight believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment\nPhilosophy called organic architecture [noise]\nHe was recorded in Nineteen fifty six at the plaza hotel in New York City where he talked about his philosophies on architecture society culture education\nThe city where he talked about his philosophies and architecture society culture education in music he was well known for being outspoken bombastic a master of publicity highly opinionated and rugged individualistic\nUh magnificently flawed and complex character [noise] his father\nWas a music teacher Baptist minister my father taught me\nHe was a preacher but he was first of all and musician made his living\nOr tried to teaching music player on\nI never was able to support his way of it in his life was\nBut he took

Chicago looking for work after the great Chicago fire where he was hired as a draftsman\nOn June first of Eighteen eighty nine Frank Lloyd Wright Mary's his first wife Katharine in by Eighteen Ninety

for God or forgave his transgressions [noise]\nBowling water is an extraordinary house designed in Nineteen thirty five by Frank Lloyd Wright built on top of a thirty foot waterfalls\nIt is by far his most popular building and best exemplifies his philosophy of organic architecture\nHarmonious union art in nature\nLocated in the mountains of south western Pennsylvania roughly Seventy miles outside of Pittsburgh it's listed among Smithsonian's life list of twenty eight places to visit before you die [noise]\nThe house was meant to complement it side while still competing with the drama of the falls in there in the sounds of crushing water power over the falls there's always felt not visual\nAs the breaking water just constantly hurt throughout the entire house\nThirty million people must have seen falling water but uh\nBut it was a very simple expression a man's love for that particular side [noise]\nMusic of the waterfall [noise]\nNever before I had I been given [noise]\nConcrete and

the first course concrete skeleton\nFalling water is masterful with goodbye [noise] considerations that right would take into account before crafting such a milestone of architecture went far beyond the basic materials used to build a house\nThe nature of the side\nNext to the nature of the materials you have to use and the people you're going to work for\nAnd what it is they want to live and

one hundred and fifty five thousand\nApproximately two point seven million adjusted for inflation\nThe cost of restoring the house in two thousand and one was eleven point five million [noise]\nFrank Lloyd Wright believed that his architecture and design had the ability to fundamentally change the lives of the people who lived in his building [noise] individual would change the way society lived in harmony with\nNature good architecture creates good behavior\nEvery now people are going to know what constitutes good architecture [noise] good environment and of course good living has to go live

treasured song which originally appeared on the singer songwriters Nineteen eighty one album the innocent age is ... loving tribute to his musician father Lawrence\n... wrote this in two thousand

two\nBogle birds that died in August of Nineteen eighty two but not before this hit song made him a celebrity was numerous media interviewers interested in him as the inspiration\nHere's de info Byrd speaking about his single leader of the ban in Nineteen Ninety One I think I could only\nIt would have said he's a fast [noise]\nBecause what that meant to my father and to me there's no way I could qualify that or even explain it um\nMy father passed away over ten years ago now and\nHe he got to hear that song he got to see this enjoyed the successor that saw\nPeople were calling him on the phone and interviewing him and his last days\nYou know who is this mandate of the band you know\nAnd he just he loved that and I loved that cause I respected him so much I mean he gave me everything I Am really my mother and hey we're both musicians and [noise]\nThe idea of being a living legacy that's really the truth I don't think I'll ever be as accomplished musician as he was\nBut um I've had a different gift came to me in a different way I've been able to reach in\nTouch people do sauce [noise]\nAnd that one is probably touched more people more deeply than anything I've ever done\nAnd by

the band which ... churches and inspired to someday possess the same love musical ability as his dad\nAnd these are from this um this is of course the leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old but his blood runs through my instrument and his son is in my soul\nMy life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man I'm just delivering legacy to the leader of the band here's their Bogle birds\nIn the industry we recall any book that lasts for more than a year or two we called them perennial write a book that's lasted for ten years would be a a very big success but\nThe irony is if you pull up of the New York times best seller list and you go to the the fine print at the bottom it says among the categories not actively track this time our perennial sellers so there's this term\nWe know that these books that that last and last and yet most of our focus in the industry whether we're making books or music or movies is about new things\nIt was in two thousand Fifteen actually for the first time in the music business that catalog album officially out sold new releases\nAnd so we know that the things that were made a long time ago if you think of many of your favorite books and movies and TV shows and restaurants many of them are not brand new it's actually the ones that have really stood the test of time that we return to over and over again\nAnd yet it it's strange where most of the energy and these industries go and so what's so fascinating about cereals connelly's sort of journey as\nHe's writing about this but then can he actually do it right you know he's writing a book about creating lasting enduring work well\nI I was fascinated by the idea of like could could he actually do it with the sort of like a a literary Babe Ruth ... hit the ball where he set out to to hit it where he pointed and told the crowd or the picture that he was going to hit it\nAnd the book it it it never became a sort of a massive\nCultural trendy sensation\nBut it did endure you know it it was published in Nineteen thirty seven and then in ... through a World War three political revolutions through bad divorces new fashion styles massive technological disruption and so many other things that if\nIt was given a second edition ten years later so Nineteen forty seven or Nineteen forty eight it was published\nAnd then in two thousand eight it was published in its third edition\nAnd it's still reading today and and here I Am talking to to you guys about it and so it's a book that's outlived him and almost everything else published at that time it's earned the author a cult like following among fellow writers and creative\nAnd I think what's so impressive is that he\nSet out to achieve this thing and he and he did it he has another quip you said you know I like my my work to outlive a dog or a cat and it is interesting how how many books\nLive a dog or a cat and it is interesting how ... how many books and projects that creative kill themselves to make\nAnd how femoral most of them are\nJames solitaire is one of my favorite novelists I was reading one of his books not long ago and on the back which wouldn't it wouldn't have been written by him but it it described his novels is having a sort of him perishable freshness and I I just love that idea I I Love the idea of making something\nPerennial some thin him perishable something that stands the test of time\nAnd by my goodness when we're watching Shawshank Redemption on TV or the godfather for Ninety it's time we know we're watching perennials right and they give us more satisfaction that so much of the new stuff that we know who's going to be old stuff really fast\nHere's Ryan sharing some stories from his own background that prompted them to create books and other work the stands the test of time\nI've always had this lifelong fascination with things that were old when I was a teenager everything I liked was all my favorite bands and release their albums decades before I was born um they were still going strong by the time I came around I I remember picking up the great Gatsby in high school and thinking\nHow incredible it is that this book that was written to be a critique of the Jazz Age right it was a timely periodical\nCould've in Jordan and somehow been so so timeless and and true even to a a random high school or in California you know sixty plus years later and\nMy first job as a writer I was a research assistant to an author named Robert Green wrote a book called the forty eight laws of power this was a book that didn't hit the best seller lists until a decade after it had come out and and yet quietly and slowly it sold\nMore than a million copies and been translated into dozens of languages I I Would guess that in a a hundred years from now people would still be reading it\nUm another book that I worked on you know got a Seventy five hundred dollar advance which is tiny advances what they call a kiss off advance in the industry meaning that the the lowest amount of money they can give you without hurting their feelings and they hope you'll go away\nAnd that book went on a cell over a million and a half copies and and you know now ten years after its release it sells about\nThree hundred copies a week and I\nI went on as a marketer became the director of marketing and American Apparel and it was interesting that that this company which of hundreds of millions of garment\nEvery year the best selling items worthy items created at the beginning of the company's trajectory it was\n... and and they had this mission of making making things that would be sold in Vinton shops in the future and I I just love this idea\nOf making things that can laugh with with my own books you know perhaps the readers haven't haven't heard of me or they certainly wouldn't have seen me on the New York times best seller lists are for the most part\nAnd yet quietly and and like clockwork they sell about five thousand copies across the various titles that every single week and the marketing for them has long since\nFinished and yet you know surprise uh one of my books did appear on a best seller list last week\nA year after it had come out and so it's this idea of making things that resonate with people that really solve some problems for them you know the the best books to have written as a creative would have been what to expect when you're expecting because every day\nAnd every part of the world\nOr a couple of gets pregnant and they don't know what to do and so I'm I'm fascinated by that kind of work the ... the work that indoors and it saddens me that so much work that is made doesn't indoor and so I was fascinated by this question of sort of what similarities\nTo these works have in common and I set out I interviewed a all sorts of of authors and editors and\nProducers and a marketers and entrepreneur is and and I tried to get to the bottom of what makes things a laugh then I you know I found a few things I think first does that work needs to be unique if it very hard for it to endure if it is not\nDefinitive if it if it doesn't stand out stand alone and yet on the other hand\nIt should do a very simple job within one on one of my editors said to me one time she said Ryan it's not what a book is\nIt's what a book does and by that she meant it has to do something for the leaders not necessarily about what it does for the creator it's about what it does so what to expect when you're expecting it it helps you with this difficult time in your life\nAnd and I think that's what the best the best work does you know it's this this question this is a blank\nThat does planned for black if you can't fill those in as a creator\nYou're going to have a lot of trouble I I was interested in the test that max Martin one of the greatest songwriters certainly the most prolific and popular signers of all time it's written for everyone from Celine Dion to the back street boys to Bon Jovi Taylor Swift and\nHis subjects his music to what he calls the car test to get in his car in Los Angeles\nAnd I put the top down he puts it on the stereo and he drives up and down the Pacific coast highway is the music\nAdding to that experience that the idea that even music is designed to really do something for the audience is something I think that people ness and and so that that's an essential part of this sort of creative process\nAnd when we come back more from Ryan Holiday on his book the perennial seller and my goodness what a fascinating question what makes things last not just our products maybe even a marriage\nYou hear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place were students study all the things that matter in life\nAll the things that are beautiful in life and I know I teach there every year for a couple of weeks\nAnd then we have some in Hillsdale fine is coming here and tell their own stories and produce stories and I can

isn't going to guarantee that my book parental seller is going to find all the people who are interested in finding it and so if you're not going to do it who will\nPeter drunk or the management expert who said that each project need someone who says I'm going to make this succeed and then goes to work and does it that that has to be you\nKnow so I push create is to think of marketing not even as an obligation but as a a central part of the creative process can you be as creative\nIn your media appearances and your marketing in your ways of getting customers as you were in writing every page or you know developing the\nUh the vintage of wine that you're you're selling or the the boots that you wanted to produce right how can that be as much of a of a canvas to paint on to make something special as\nAs the than you you made itself and\nA lot of creative fail at this I mean the the the shelves grown with and watched movies and on read books and\nYou know our phones are filled with downloaded music and hard cast that will never get around to see him in so that urgency that sense of I've got to make people care about this is really the essential task of the writer or the creative of any kind you know if you build it\nThey will not come that is not how it works you have to make them you have to invite them one by one and until the crowd is full until the the seats are filled and that's why you did this work in the\nFirst place right certainly no one slaves away on some creative artistic project purely for their own satisfaction or otherwise why would they have ever released it in the first place and so\nThat idea of of taking ownership of of it is the difference I think between something that sells five copies and something that's almost five million copies and I think every artist would rather whether they admit it or not reach five million people than five\nAnd there you have it Ryan Holiday his new book perennial seller centrally answering the question what makes things less\nFrom products or\nTo marriage or anything else you care about in your wife [noise]\nAnd by the way I Love the line not important what a book is about\nTo support it's important

goes and goes what\nAm I here for and he goes it goes well Mike spun up Nineteen days and were shot him off and and uh and I said I've only been up fourteen and ... says you've been with us the whole time you know they all they all knew I hadn't\nSlept and the one guy leaves he says he didn't get nothing for many of my paper man he was just discussed and laugh and then before he left or because you made a promise to us because all the time when I'd be doing drugs and stuff I Would always promising this platform\nIs going to help when I quit I'm going to come back in and help everyone you know get out of this horrific addiction everything there are many times I was and crack houses or bars or whatever and I would talk about revelation which I read about when I was ever in jail you know every time I was in jail I\nRead the Bible about the only time I wasn't you know so I'm telling these got well they would quit that day the next day like twenty people quit all through my life I'm going what did I say\nAnd they go I don't know but it sure made sense what normally you would think it's a hypocrite no this is really bad give me another line you know and and they would they would lesser but all that time it was me\nTelling them trying to convince myself you know trying to convince myself or there will be Jesus or whether it'd be to get off the drugs\nThat was me trying to

you have left and I had I don't know enough to probably a last an hour or so and he sits there and and now I I run out I'm scraping the pipe anybody that's on crack out there\nYou're scraping the residue out of the pipe and re smoking at and try and then you're looking on the ground all over the carpet trying to find pieces you dropped over the last few\nDays and it's horrific and then uh any way I look over he's asleep so I had on down to the streets only white guy on there I mean they're going you ain't got nothing for me you're not getting nothing for me and I mean all these things are

really kick\nIn my living\nA real life\nMy fifth year reunion with my class everyone's now is out of college they get these amazing jobs they've started families or they've kept with the same company since high school stay in my mind they were way ahead of me\nAnd it was very it was bothering me inside and then it was just going wow everybody's ahead of me and I'm doing stop to show up you know I got into you know I was a card counted then I took took accounting class professional card but I hadn't even started it yet or whatever I just read the class so I'm\nI'm bragging at at the reunion about skydiving with a parachute not opening and or my car accidents and my card counter things that they've never seen or the mafia coming after me you know so I'm blowing their minds\nAnd so we don't get on the topic of uh yeah how are you doing for work how you do or not you know what are you doing Mike how many kids got home you know how your family you know I'm just completely\nPutting up just wall you know to these other things so they're all thinking I'm nuts basically but it was a very it was\nThat starting there was a very much a driver and it was like there was a lot of non started to be a shame you know I'm going you know this is this is not who I can be done that I prayed I said you know God all I Want is to meet the right woman and have you know kids and and uh you know it'd be that the white picket fence so to speak\nAnd then got brought bad at all to me and handed me on a silver\nPlatter until my could\nJeopardize and animals are in ... by then I was very functioning cocaine addict too I look back over here was perfect well no there was a lot of dysfunction even though it's hard to for the addiction to to hide it all the time kids didn't even know that and that's how good I Would assume it was a lot of\nWork hiding the cocaine and then the crack\nThe kids didn't know okay even like ... just to give our kids are sending their kids over there because we were the fund you know this is back in that you know when they were younger and was cocaine but then when the crack came on that took us down fast when cocaine turned into crack and and the kids\nAnd my daughter at that time and we we got right when it all kind of blew up she says we're very dysfunctional family or I don't know what that means but don't ever say that again we're not dysfunctional such where where what do you mean what it sounded just horrible I didn't know what it really really meant you know and [laughter] so that don't sovereign\nBut I lost it all off and then she lost at all\n\nAnd in the midst of a lot of this dysfunction Mike was all ready running\nMy hello\nI tried every pill even when I was sixteen years old I bought one of my first paychecks when to buy a pillow at that grocery store I worked at\nThis teenager spent Seventy dollars on that would be two hundred and eighty seven dollars in today's money\nOr law so I spent the most expensive pillow thinking it would be the best it was a down pillow and it was the worst because they you know I Know now they just sell us air I mean I I mean how\nCan that be it feels good down and goes but I couldn't return it that I Do remember they would not let me return that pillow but then through all my life I'm trying different pills and I always had problems with sleep and wake up in the morning we had a cake but mostly these sleep interruption or not being able to get to sleep right away\nSo and in two thousand four I had a very clear dream of the name my\nPillow and wrote my pillow all over the house in ... in connecting the wind in the pie and and you know these logos and I'm going\nThat sounds really corny you know um but I go well where's my pillow you know I mean if you ... it's hard for you to think back now 'cause there's my everything and it was because of my pillow got big everybody took up demise but my daughter came upstairs and there was she looked and there are pieces of paper written all over and\nLives he says uh she gets a glass Russia I don't know she's eleven years old maybe she said what are you doing dad now and I go\nI'm going to Memphis pillow and I realized I hadn't even got the you know what what is going to be made of it was going to do it's going to be the best thing ever have seen it and and this can be caught my pill and\nShe looks at all these piece of paper she goes that's really random dad and she went back downstairs well then the kids seven to their mother at the time Wednesday I get over this pillow thing and then he said oh it's just a phase it'll be it'll be over with and I was it at that\nTime I wasn't doing anything I sold my little bar restaurant so my total focus was on this pill now well then I still had to figure out the material so we tried over Ninety four different kinds of phones and fails to put it in there and one son daring and I've now managing\nEleven hundred twelve hundred employees of the manufacturing that's what he does now but she is like nine or ten years old and everyday ring up from school and then we tried different kinds of stuff on the deck and the fall would fly all over the neighborhood and betrayed little machines to get to work and finally we get it in a work once we had the pillows all made\nWe had Margaret ... house everything and we had no money left but we had like three hundred pillows\nEverything and we had no money left but we had like three hundred pillows\nAnd I went into the first two I walked into a was a bed baths and beyond I'll just say the name in

dear yeah I don't have a beer Enron yeah\nBefore we get into your running and other accomplishments we love to talk to almost everybody who walked through the store\nAnd we love to talk to almost everybody who walked through the door for all of our interview process where were you born tell us about your parents and one of the things in childhood that using ... to become the guy you are today\nI was born in Los Angeles\nSo California born and raised a I'm a hundred percent of Greeks I'm from a a great grandparents\nUm [noise] I remember running home from kindergarten when I was six years old I was the oldest child and when we had my my youngest sister I said we've got a I've got a brother who's a little bit younger than me and then my sister I remember my mom is having a hard time getting me home from school\nAnd my dad was working two jobs so I just said mom you don't have to worry about getting me home and she said well how are you going to get home\nAnd I said well I'm going to run home\nAnd I remember really enjoying running I remember sitting in the classroom or just waiting for the ... you know what young kid especially a boy wants to sit still and pay attention I mean a young boy he wants to run around and go wild\nAnd I remember sitting there in that classroom to ... you know counting down the moment to tell the bell rang and then running home\nAnd I still don't want us to fill in pay attention so you know\nEven though we're both ...\nAnd so tell me this you you you start to I guess do it all boys do would you increase the challenge just step it up a little bit more talk about how that happened increasing your distance as as a kid\nWell there's this idea of never stop exploring and in running it's very symbolic Iran that I ran a marathon when I was fourteen years old so that's you know twenty six point two miles\nAnd I thought maybe the furthest that anyone could ever run a and then I heard about people running further than that and I I couldn't believe it I heard about fifty miles foot race and I thought that's impossible a human being can't run continuously for fifty miles\nI got to try it so I signed up in Iran fifty miles and you know at the fifty mile races as well congratulations you qualified\nAnd I'm thinking qualified for what for the insane asylum and they said no you qualified for the western states one hundred mile endurance run\nAnd I could not wrap my head around the idea of someone running a hundred miles nonstop I thought you know there's gotta be campsites along the way you know how many days does it take and they said no the starting gun goes off and you run as though you're running you know a mile race around the track you just run for twenty four hours nonstop\nOr they were very independent um almost separate nations have a sort but they all polluted and all kind of used best practices\nOr to better themselves and I think the Greeks you know the Greeks have said we can't turn anywhere else I mean we're kind of we we've got to help herself they've been very self reliant is is one quality that I've seen with Greeks\nAnd um you know we're we're a definitely a minority I I think that a Greek Americans make up um something less than half a percent of the U.S population but I'm per capita\nThere are more Greek PHD's than any other class and its millionaires is while they're more Greek millionaires\nThan any other ethnic group and this is I get per capita or small small base of people yeah\nYeah and I'm Lebanese and and we're a little behind the Greece but here's a group of people that come into this country and I got to tell you do not many ... I got made fun of a lot didn't bother me because my parents said don't worry about it\nYou know for every person that made funnier there's ten people love you and I found the true to do to the nature of the American experiment and the American people there really generous they wanted to try out my foods the family foods and they were deeply curious and that one no go ahead and the crowd you just have to learn to ignore them and get on with the rest of your life [laughter] and then\nI've got a Lebanese friends I Know where you're talking about there they are they're funny people really great\nPeople always just say let's turn something really ugly under something funny yeah we live short so let's talk back to that fifty marathons and fifty days and say that these days you\nYou start in St Louis on September Seventy two thousand six with Lewis and Clark marathon you ended on November of two thousand six with the New York city marathon a talk about some highlights some low light to dean because they're got to be moments even inside you are you going what was I thinking\n[laughter] plenty of those moments\nOf but you know it was it was great exploration I mean it was a for for one you know just for the listeners to explain how I did this I had a a big school bus\nAnd my mom is a retired public school teacher so I brought my kids along to my daughter and my son they were young at that point and my mom would wrote school them so she basically home school them as we're driving around the country for fifty days at their schools were sending them the lesson plans emailing them to my mom\nEvery Sunday night and she teach a lesson throughout the week and we all of a sudden became like that of a kind of this traveling um road show where\nAll of my kids' friends from school were so curious you know what were the experiences they were having it and then their parents learned about it so now their parents were falling out and people started learning about what I was doing and they were coming out like we'd have fifty sixty people show up at the starting line of a race\nComing out like we'd have fifty sixty people show up at the starting line of a race in Iowa on Tuesday Morning for an\nEnd yeah though and marathon for flying from Alaska guy came in from Japan to run with me they heard about this and it just was like this Brotherhood they can't sit or they came together after that was\nYou know the ... the really a poignant and and beautiful moments and some of the low moments where I remember running a marathon in Alaska and it was snowing and cold\nAnd the next day I was in Arizona and it was about a hundred and five degrees running through the desert and I remember finishing the race thinking\nThis is marathon Nineteen I can barely walk you know how many had to get out of bed to all morning and run a marathon let alone you know thirty more after that so there were some moments where I really doubt it I could do it um and just you know\nKept that American Spirit to said you know when I get out of bed in the morning I Would say I don't think about running a marathon just get to the bank you know the bathroom and spice of water in your face\nYou know okay that's great to just put on your shorts you know one leg at a time okay lace up your shoes okay get out the door [laughter] get to the starting line okay just start running just put one foot in front of the other uh so became at points are very uh cerebral challenges twelve and physical one\nYeah I Would assume that you know I I've gotten into my ... wife and he has the same role the young guys on the court and it's not anything else but these two simple words next to play\nNot to play before and not to replace five boys and the next game or the NCAA finals just next play\nIn so many of the kids in an athlete who played under his to ... talk about how that helped him focus on just the next activity in front of you life didn't become as intimidating that way\nYou well and it's ... you're right I Am with running you know it gets very grant writers said yeah instead of mixed play its next step your next step\nNext step because you tend to look at the market especially during the marathon you know you might be a mile and you might see a market and says my Eighteen\nWhich means you know you basically have over eight miles to go and you know you might be cramping at that point you know you might just be completely exhausted it's demoralizing at the heavy weight and your shoulders to think how am I going to run another eight miles on top of what I'd done\nDon't do that I just said next step put the blinders on about the future don't reflect on the past just being the present moment in that now next step next step so I really I can relate to the next play mentality\nYou know there's a great thing for life I think kind of stay in the moment and not get overwhelmed by the agency's in life which can easily overwhelm any of us if we look too far down the road or too far back\nInto the past it it can be paralyzing let's talk about this cross country road trip because my goodness we talked to one person who's biked across the country for Dave Dave Thomas's foundation he's a Wendy's franchisee who said my goodness I Want to raise the money for kids\nAnd so he wrote you wrote across the country on a bicycle and we followed them along what was jogging across the country like and by the way what did you learn about your country when you do this and that fifty day into the state or adventure and what's your family learn\nYou know I'd I learned we're we're a very diverse country I mean you you hear that set all the time and that's almost cliche but the regional differences I'm not just with the food and you know the dialect\nBut with philosophy and the way you approach life is so varied as you run across the country\nUm but the one the one you know the ... the one uniting thing if it were all free and we're all freedom loving people\nSo that support I got along the way was remarkable it's almost like Forrest Gump I mean some day that'd be running and they'd be forty or fifty people running with me you don't have the remote highway [laughter] out in the in the desert I remember running over the Rockies in a snowstorm and people showing up on the side of the road with hot chocolate\nSo we you know I I learned that running can transcend our differences and bring people together I mean there's so many things in this world that that divide us right be it you know political beliefs to Carver scan the God we worship whatever\nI Wonder how is that they're running a and people were running with me it's a commonality all of us human share and it brought us together regardless of you know the food we ate um you know the accent we had so uh it was really beautiful seem that the support people that came out after not talking about elite runners some elite runners but\nSome people just coming out to run a mile or two by my side\nYeah then I by the way what's so interesting to me I'm a dear friend of mine just Italian guy who was one of my mentors and he said you know if you can do these three things a lot you can have a happy life play sports a lot because you're not talking dance a lot 'cause you're not talking\nAnd and last but not least and this was as you said love a lot because then you're not talking\n[laughter] I Love and you're not talking about the ladder yeah I think I'll go with a letter to when we come back and I think that's what's transcendental is you're running where people you're not going to get them into an argument you running together you might chat a little bit but there's something about just running together just throwing a ball with your kids you don't have to talk throws the ball it just the movements\nOf the movement back just a beautiful thing as the same thing when we come back more with ultra marathon man dean Cornell says this is our American story and by the way to hear all that we do go to Alan Iverson network dot org such our American network dot org more after these\nMaps\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nYou hear a lot of ... college here on our American

and the ... the Greek runner feeding ... deputies that ran the marathon and uh it's uh it's basically a history book as well so\nYou know ironically right now the book is it's\nNumber one on Amazon and the category of Greek history and I'm not a historian but I doubt very deeply into the history\nOf of ancient Greece and the evolution of running a marathon and I also learned a lot about my identity and I think this gets back to what you talked about um you know being a Lebanese and wanting to know more where you came from\nSo I actually went back degrees to the very village my grandfather came from and his grandfather and his grandfather before him and discovered a lot about\nYou know why I'm all about and how it became who I Am and where my people came from and that to me it was fascinating I think that's something that that you know we look at the the\nPopularity of things like ancestry dot com\nOr twenty three and me you know the genetic tests that can tell you where your ancestors came from ballet did I learn where my ancestors came from I visited these places and ... how they lived you know generations ago and that was really fast and they had to write about all this in the book\nYou know there's one point in time where you say at the START I was surrounded by three hundred and fifty warriors huddled in the pre dawn missed at the foot of the crop a list of Athens for me the quest was deeply personal I'd been waiting a lifetime to be standing in this place I Would finally run alongside my ancient brother\nClose out with us those words who was an ancient brother you just mentioned them and that feeling running and starting to run by the crop all is\nIt so that ain't your brother was his name was ... and he was part of a class of people called he drove me they were professional day long runners they were foot Harold foot messengers and his mission was ... when the Persian invaded Greece at the bad marathon\nThe Athenians said we need to recruit the Spartans to help us we need reinforcements were badly outnumbered they dispatched is this man ... he used to run a hundred and fifty three miles nonstop to spark to to recruit the sport in\nThe battle and it was because of his ... undertaking and his mission that\nDemocracy is what it is today I mean he basically saved democracy Greece was the first democratic state and the Persians won to crush him had he not succeeded in running a hundred and fifty three miles to recruit the Spartans our life to be very much different and\nTo me that it it was incredible to retrace those footsteps and to do it um my cell and twenty five hundred years later\nAnd that's where we love doing here on our American stories into the story of the people we have long am I doing this that sounds like your story
