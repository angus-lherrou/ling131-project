well you know it's\nIt's kinda like it because if you live in Chicago yeah 'cause I live in Chicago and all you hear about from people that a lot of other places they do they talk about Al Capone of violence but it's like any section you know there's a lot of wonderful places there sure there's a lot of civilian areas however [noise]\nPart of the problem is the government there doesn't do things well they think like Obama they just want to raise taxes\nFor example if you go to a restaurant or food is Fifteen Percent sales tax on food and if you order like a like a drink it's Eighteen percent

announced the guy is the government democratically elected one isn't\n[noise] well this last election there was a big uh uh this name as his initials or a jail wage because he used to be before Honduras just had one term for four years [laughter]\nAnd then when the bomb was president he somehow was able to get the legislature to make a two terms and people just liked it and there was a lot of writing in the streets in fact they closed on uh they're they're called the ... they're called cloud is what they did is they closed all the highways and stuff so people couldn't get to the airport and actually suspended\nFlights in San Pedro a couple of times because of that [noise] and and what they did this last time he'll they have these these like toll booth leaving the city there's three ... three major toll booths and they they just burn them out they just destroyed the buildings and the toll booths are no longer collecting tolls\nAnd that's a that's a major hit [noise] you know and and that's that's just it's amazing when I was down there the one time I couldn't actually get home I had to wait for two days\nAnd you could hear the gunfire in the background 'cause San Pedro was like in a huge valley surrounded by mountains\nAre generally you what's the what's the life for the average Honduran what's it like\nWell if you have money you do well if you're poor or you don't want to be there because there's no public assistance\nTo the public hospitals are Laden with cockroaches [noise] but you know there's a lot of beautiful restaurants there the food is wonderful you know it's it's so it's like it's mixed\nYou know I've been going there for thirty some years in fact my ex wife I'm a his from there and that was part of the attraction I went there and I have two daughters with her they're teenagers now and I'm Still good with my my inlaws and thinks\nIt's nice but you know you gotta be careful you don't want to do a bad business deal with anybody because of the good chance we could get hurt\nOkay now now you said you're against Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and Nicaragua is coming to America why are you against it\nWell it doesn't serve a purpose you know the same energy they see a lot of this is being ... funded by these left us you know George Soros types and and you know they should spend the same energy and resource to try to fix what's wrong in their own\nGovernment saying the stand your dream fix your own country what he said why leaving the best in the brightest might be leaving you leave behind those who can't function so it's really in the long term mental is that's what\nHappens a lot of people with means a lot of Hondurans they should have gone to Spain and a lot of them\nCome illegally here you know in fact I hate to say it's one of my good friends actually got killed about five years ago he was involved in a bad car deal the transaction [noise] and he got off a pay cut killed right before Christmas\nSo you don't go there and you get a gun and kill somebody\nYeah and his brother actually had a tourist season he left his you know he's a ... the California for the last five years he ...\nHe gotta you're going to get married is going to try to get a paper view that these are the marriage so a lot of people with resources have left [noise] and come over here and then try to stay here you know by getting married he was doing something else to become legal\nRight it's it's a big problem he also down there you know their energy consumption they keep raising the price for a for electricity it's all diesel powered a generation it's not efficient is expensive and they keep raising the price of energy [laughter]\nYou know my water bills going up you know like fifty percent of the last four or five years\nSo it's a broken society nothing's working and it's getting worse it's\nNot nothing but it could be a better manage just put it that way\nWell who's doing the managing it is in a military democratically elected it doesn't matter in Honduras\nWell the president was actually reelected the second time but a lot of people thought he stole the election that's why there's a lot of writing the streets and that's why they had these strikes you know\nBut that's all kind of died down now but the problem is you know they keep raising the prices of everything [noise] so if you're if you're stuck down there and you're not you don't have a job where you can be tied into dollars so to speak you know things keep getting out of sight it's just like Venezuela no Venezuela\nBut it's the whole thing with inflation and try to keep up with stuff\nAnd yeah it's not always there's about a thirty eight forty million people who live in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua about thirty five to forty million how many would come to America given a choice of the Democrats got in charge and\nFive to forty million how many would come to America given a choice of the Democrats got in charge and a complete open

judge does not have the presumption of innocence\nDoesn't have it at all in fact once the allegation is made that is tantamount to conviction even Michael ... Scott mentioned Julie sweat and they had to take them as completely accurate and having asked for a one week delay\nThen when the FBI supplement it first seven time Mitch report they found that the nine witnesses interviewed by the FBI over the last five or six days and do so Thursday night we're kind of not not enough to add another list to twenty five more and was they were interviewed there'd be forty more and after that for a hundred more it would never stop\n'cause this is all about running out the clock taking about control descended on November the six that's what it's all about\nIt's not about fairness or determining whether or not you know Cavanaugh is a Romney slash Bush Republican he's not an Amy Coney Coney Barrett or a judge to park\nI have a sense that cabin always going to be a conservative\nMaybe about along the lines of an Anthony Kennedy because that's just what is your one when Susan Collins one Saturday yesterday and spent all that time at three o'clock\nRunning over his opinions and looked at me like a pretty moderate Republican why was selected I'm not sure but once they came out with his wife and his daughters and the girls basketball team then the vicious lies perpetrated a bone and by the Senate Mother Nature media\nI got on his side completely one hundred percent and the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball anymore nor teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done\nNot because there is truthful information or corroborate information in fact it was shown to be false it's because the allegations the title nine proceedings\nBut that were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the fact you put a second front door in our house including the fact that uh\nThere were four witnesses that would corroborate her story including our best girlfriend none of them did everything fell apart every part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out in an affidavit to the Senate how\nMany times that professor Ford lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times\nAnd the major media because it didn't fit\nThis was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message through other Trump nominees this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett\nA judge third part of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this or a judge the judge hardness or wait for you\nAnd so it was about frightening and scaring the next nominee I oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court but in a Youtube video a couple of months old she couldn't identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said\nI mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it but she wants to stick it out for the next two years hoping the Democrat wins in twenty twenty which I predict tonight is not going to happen a container and their cause real cause some

twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens\nAnd made Nineteen eighties she had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely\nSuddenly there was one boy and not for\nSuddenly it was in her late teens it was Fifteen suddenly one in the mid Nineteen eighties it was Nineteen eighty two she had to change your story in order to fit Brad Kevin all that clearly indicated to me that she was mistaken at a minimum and probably line\nLet's continue with Brian from Indianapolis Brian in Annapolis welcome to the bill Cunningham show Brian go have\nA really good evening how are you\nA great day to being an American\nYesterday's yesterday's say listen I got I got several liars in the fire and if you fair with me I'll get them all out here man and you and we'll we'll ask them all out the first thing I I you know I listen to Susan Collins speak that she gay wonderful is excellent and and it was very truthful\nOkay Number two\nMy sis my little sister is a victim of a sexual assault that would have turned into a rape they've not been here for her boyfriend that that showed up and this was back in Nineteen eighty one okay never and I had some disagreements when when the doctor was hit her testimony in front of the committee\nAfter the fact took all come out the FBI investigation even my little sister who told me you know why don't you believe what she is saying I think I Believe for her but she has a lot inconsistencies\nAnd after all of this she has come to the conclusion also that she had a lot of inconsistencies and he got the bully she believes something happened to her but you don't believe it happened when Brett Kavanaugh was he\nWas running all what happened to her was a therapist knows for boys tried to re first she was in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties that happened and that doesn't fit Brad Kevin all but she projected his face on those four boys goes to fit or a political opinions\nBut I Do market across team was it is\nYeah lacrosse team they re boys in\nBoise got accused of rape yeah OK and now getting out here shipping hears again not Brett Kavanaugh he's ... he he's right he is down in the middle a moderate conservative if you look at his decisions\nThat the constitution is not a my opinion is not a living breathing document it is written Jimmy interpreted as it is written and that's the only way that our constitutional republic will survive\nWe cannot change the parameters or move the Gulf posed as the Democrats do\nAh on this and I believe Brett Kavanaugh will roll roll as the constitution dictates the ... guy Kim\nBrand can I tell you fired a conversation and had dinner with Antonin Scalia or ... I remember you talking about here years ago and he said look it comes down to two words which is who decides he said we have a brilliant foundational documents that provide certain rights immunities\nEt cetera et cetera if anything else happens with space travel and cancer and the death penalty and the guillotine in other words the Congress decides all these other issues he said to me many times I Would I Would find constitutional law that I Would never passed but it's not my role as a Supreme Court justice\nTo supplant the will of the people he said you do your fellow citizens to go out there and convince others as to their worthiness of what you're saying pass a law and if it does in conflicts with the U.S constitution that is the law the land was he the Democrats don't want to do that they want to short circuit\nThe democracy their constitutional republic or in and they want to go to the court system to impose on us laws that they can't get otherwise past that's the problem\nAnd here's this is my next point this is my next point they want to expand we don't we cannot live we cannot have everybody in the world come and live in the United states of America is physically impossible [noise] we don't have we don't we don't have enough fight we don't have enough\nSpace congestion salt so\nSo the constitution of course the founding fathers didn't realize how big our nation will become but the constitution has set parameters that the Democrats want to adjust and expand now with with the appointment of cabin all\nPresident Trump keeping its promises they're going to resort to violence and the mid term elections you watch they're gonna raise or I'm not I'm surprised that nobody has been even worse than what it\nHas no Brian taken what you're saying even lease they've already resorted to violence look what they did a brunch kilometer Fox and friends look what they did to Jeff Flake ... they're they're shooting the Democrats are shooting Republicans and like it was a one day story and then ignored\nExactly and I and I appreciate you guys giving me this time and I got one one more\nPoint in your head because\nNow we ... the the the endgame bellicose veep Angelica vote is going to be very important in terms that you know these people have called me so many names now the ...

deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nHow many jobs and talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico we talking about a million\nWas you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff\nTo make a big deal if they have three hundred actually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country to the European Union has been\nBrutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed just to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they show Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in the audience and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a piece of grain okay if we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but are going to give you one more chance and has said that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately after the plane and came over and talk to now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with him I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the we've\nGot all the way of five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we've don't Shanghai we felt Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the\nYou got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's got to come back to America\nHis show right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President Xi but instead we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been in effect what people do say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's at twenty five percent\nSo we're taking billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it so\nChina has been look China is the biggest ... by far probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade with everybody those days are over bill\nNow Wesley wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart it's a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls below sea takes the house Schumer Texas Senate your life becomes miserable the last two

say they met terms for lack of take it easy not important Renee see whether it's black burner Heller we don't have to worry about that what do you say to motivate the base\nWell I Hope we're nation is going to do well first of all he's a great guy but I I just say just country what just forget it ...\nYou have to go out and vote my poll numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to vote one percent Rasmussen fit and we know we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it because when people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means it's a Trump voter I don't know if that's good or bad but that's what I mean it's a we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice cabin on fifteenth judge out however that fifty new judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice cabin or because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the men are great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law banana consequences because since I've had many women were spurred my air bell I with Kevin they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican face when otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nAnd you've been a great friend of mine and I appreciate that you've been a very terrific guy and so you're also a terrific talent you know a lot of people can't do what you do you know this is talk relatives Russian about uh that's not too many and Sean is you know so it was great but these are great people great talents\nAnd I appreciate it do we have to do well uh I think we're going to do well in the Senate I think we can pick up some seats in the Senate and the polls\nIf you look three weeks ago and you look now it's like especially ... when she was ... points down now she has four or five points up Marcia from Tennessee that ... ... almost all of them now I don't know how you doing here I Know it's a tough race but uh it's unfortunate because he's such a good\nMan I mean I don't know Sherrod Brown says socialist but you know he has a lot of Trump voters are voting for sure he's going around in a lot of people think he's my best friend in the world the ads are like Trump pads he talks about you know it's amazing except there's only during this period of time at six weeks\nAfter it's over so it's one of those things but\nI Hope it does well and uh I Hope that Steve does well I think he's doing well for ... when I hear is doing so I think that's very important and I'm here for them\nBut I just want to thank you for everything you've done and and hopefully people are going to realize that this is a very important election Mitt terms I think frankly I think people are viewing this as very important you know usually midterms are like sleepers yeah people they they are energized and for those that say that the\nThat the blue is energized bringing the Democrats and we're not ... I think personally I think we're more energized\nSuzie Lebanon they lined up yesterday morning us yeah there's twenty thousand trying to get into two thousand yeah it it's a problem with the size of
