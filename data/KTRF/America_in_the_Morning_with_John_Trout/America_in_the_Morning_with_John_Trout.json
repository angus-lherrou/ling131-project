better than the man who has covered for presidency for three different news organization CBS News chief White House correspondent major Garrett\nWho was taking time to write Mr Trump's wild ride published by all points books would subtitled the thrills ... an occasional blackouts have an extraordinary presidency you lead off here with a prologue that is a very revealing it as you you know perhaps it was a it should have been more revealing\nThat it actually was do you ... it's titled to what I should have learned and this is the first thing that Donald Trump ever said to major\nMajor fantastic I watched it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled unquote what was it that you should have learned briefly\nThat there's so much that comes with Donald Trump that's right out in front and he doesn't hide things he doesn't speak\nIn a kind of a double talk or synthetic language that a lot of experience than capable politicians use most things about Donald Trump are very visible and then that prologue I take myself to task for not understanding what I could have learned\nIn just looking at the words and the sentence you just read I won't give it away 'cause it's an entertaining prologue but I Do take myself to task for not saying hey maybe there's something right here in front of me and if I just spent some time to look and listen and learn\nI'll get ahead of the game it took me many many months of being around Donald Trump to figure out what I look back in retrospect might have been more obvious to me that it's been a little bit more time\nAnd the other point of the book was Trump's wild ride you do a thank you rally he held in Wisconsin just outside of Milwaukee after he had won the election\nAnd uh you note that Paul Ryan was or the house be grid not appeared once with Donald Trump during the campaign that is to say the twenty twelve running mate had not campaigned with the parties plenty sixteen nominee Ryan shows up there more than seven thousand jubilant Trump supporters including a thousand\nWho had stood in sub freezing temperatures for more than six hours and Ryan says in that crowd of seven thousand I recognize maybe ten people I've been doing Republican events practically all my life I didn't know any of the these are not Republicans were Trump voters\nAre at the time I said the Republican Party was undergoing a hostile takeover I guess in a in a way it was\nIt was and it sort of depends on your definition of hostility or as Trump likes to say the rallies are full of spirit and energy and the great fire that he loves and the Trump supporters have this kind of almost ... billion call and response with Trump whether it's the wall or in a much\nMore aggressive sense lock her up really talking about Hillary Clinton but they have this sort of play act relationship is that all hostile\nWell Trump doesn't things so Trump supporters do lots of Republicans look at that and say where a direct surely is this all leading us well it led Donald Trump to be the forty fifth present I'd states and those Trump's orders to identify with the Republican Party at least branded as they see Trump branding it as their new political home the duration of all that\nI don't know I Do not have a unified theory ... about where all this is going\nI Do just try to describe what I've seen what's happened so far and what it might\nMean it's interesting to note that an awful lot of people who were fed up with the conservative politicians who talked to a conservative but didn't always vote conservative really led to a great extent to the Trump phenomenon and yet that inconsistency which is quite understandable that it caused consternation among Republican ranks\nUh Donald Trump has shown a great diverse agility of a a convictions over the years and that doesn't seem to bother his supporters as much\nDoesn't bother as supporters uh he is probably the least evangelical a Republican who has been in politics for the last twenty or Thirty years to have as fervent support among evangelical Christians and ... Republicans and conservatives I also point out in the book and one of the most disciplined and focus components of the Trump Administration\nThe federal bench started with the Supreme Court but

and the sooner or later although I don't think the docket this term includes any but sooner or later the Supreme Court will again have to tackle the thorny issues surrounding the second amendment\nWe thought we'd take a look at the director the which that might go with Dave workman senior editor at the gun magazine dot com and at liberty party press he's also a communications director for the citizens committee for the right to keep and bear arms are there any particular\nA Second Amendment issues that you could expect to see it coming up before the Supreme Court in the not too distant future\nWell there are a couple of cases down in California that I think are trying to wind their way up through the courts as we know that the the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in San Francisco the most liberal court in the United states\nAnd it's also the will show Richard and I think there's there are a couple of gun case down there are I Believe there is also going to be a new challenge to the Jersey a concealed carry a scheme that they have going back there\nOr maybe Maryland will come up to a there are several states with very restrictive concealed carry stitch huge\nAnd with the a more conservative more are constitutionally oriented Supreme Court\nI think some of those laws are going to come under Ollie coal strict scrutiny and we'll see how woolly fair\n[noise] one of the more important gun control issues to come up before the courts in recent years is a D.C versus Heller that is to say a look at the district of Columbia's gun control law I Want to quote what a appellate courts to judge Kavanaugh had to say seven years ago a quote\nIn disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry and felon in possession laws\nHeller established at the scope of the second Amendment rights and plus the constitutionality of gun bans and regulations is determined by reference to text history and tradition unquote than judge Brett Kavanaugh your thoughts on how this will carry forward into of cases before the Supreme Court\nWhile I think that gives us a hint of four or eight and justice Kavanaugh is going to come down on Second Amendment issues he understands that\nAre all rights can be regulated to some degree but they're not government regulated privileges and certainly the second amendment is not a government regulated privilege it is a fundamental constitutionally protected right\nAnd I think from from reading what he said in that historic descent I thought it was ... you get the\nImpression that he is going to come down\nOn the side of the individual right to bear arms even outside the home or with a permit they they they were really forced by the courts to create a concealed carry system in the district of Columbia District but\nUh again it's not above being challenged again in the courts and you know that may be a case that comes before the high court to eventually\nAnd has been a while since we've had a major Second Amendment issue before the Supreme Court despite the fact that there have been the number of uh uh such cases bubbling around out there which may be symptomatic of a larger condition at the Supreme Court and that is a reluctance to touch hot potatoes I've never understood that\nI understand why Congress doesn't like to even though it's their constitutional duty to do so but they're afraid of of reelection if they vote on some controversial issue that's a chicken but are understandable with the Supreme Court they're there for life\nOf why should they shy away from such issues\nI think historically as we saw with the retired Justice John Paul Stevens [noise] ah there are some liberal justices who have been on the court really didn't want to take on the second amendment murmur Sanford limits and wrote that great\nPiece or some years ago called the embarrassing Second Amendment or you know there's there's a lot to that sentiment\nA it's an embarrassment to a lot of these liberal\nOr jurors who think God you know we're stuck with the second amendment I Wish we could just tell the world that this applies only to the militia well we've gone beyond that that horses left the barn\nOr the second amendment protects an individual right and now they're going to have to deal with that and I think with the justice cabin on the high court we'd probably stay in a pretty good chance of dealing with it\n[noise] ah and then again there's always the worry many conservatives feel\nThat we will have another quote conservative justice unquote who doesn't prove to be a idiot logically pure seems a democratic presidents have picked a it'd be a logical clones probably more reliably than have Republicans us not forget the Justice Stevens\nWas a a Gerry Ford pick\n[noise] yeah but it Gerry Ford was what some people might call a rhino Republican in name only I I never met Gerry Ford and you know we'll we'll just let the history decide what kind of a prison it was\nA I think with Canada although we've got a pretty good idea that he's gonna stick pretty close to\nThe second amendment would admit at the time that it was written in what it means today and you know I think we're looking at a uh some good times I think for the second amendment because as my friend Alan Gottlieb but the second amendment
