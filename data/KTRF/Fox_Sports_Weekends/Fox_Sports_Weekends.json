I I got to be full disclosure I\nHad a long day yeah I Do a better job a full time and\nA show and then we had to my niece's partied so I'm watching the game to party and then I go home and I'm watching the game and and\nI actually stopped it was it was after the the that Utah pulled away from UCLA was current route right I was all on baseball and I I does does and I it was\n... I ... you wouldn't be expected anything different come on man I'll be honest I there were times where the game was watching me more time that I was watching it I had and now it on TV and I was in bed I was like as I got to get up you know at one thirty two o'clock to get over here and get ready for this show ah my my thing the TV was watching me many times [laughter]\nYeah I was ... I was the top of the search you\nAnd I remember letting my ears do this\nTo topple the thirteenth and they did the red Sox just scored on the throne our mhm right and and and I'm going and I like let myself all the fall asleep [laughter] thinking that it'll probably be I'll probably get re overcome that it's probably over\nSo I let myself sleep and try to try to stay in a way\nAnd then I wake up and I'm like oh my God just to check the score [laughter] and it was one of those moments that it's it's a question that I have for you and our crew\nAnd the audience which is when you went the baggage X back being something and woke up to it amazing surprise\nRight like I expected when I fell asleep I fell asleep expecting the red Sox to be up to three ... right I expected Boston to have won that game last night right and the Dodgers come back and now you come back\nBut they play five more innings\nAnd they it's just incredible drama\nOpposite of among the I went back and I visit to the ... the home run you know\nI mean it was it was it was just unbelievable federally\nWell I mean you know here here's the thing I as I said I found the the the TV on watching me more and uh I think when\nI fell asleep the first time was probably in the eighth any or somewhere around there somewhere around I Can't remember what any was\nBut it was it was just going back and forth nobody was making headway is built on that wasn't the because the other was still in pitch and um but yeah it's just it it just went back and forth and then all of a sudden you would hear this loud share something with starting in ... what\nWhat happened oh OK doctors up okay a boss who came back up ... oh man it looks like and you fall asleep so I kept going in and out the entire evening and so finally I think it was around the thirteenth fourteenth I was just like I Can't do any more I've got to get some sleep because now I'm a I'm I feel ... denies\nThat word I just thought that I feel I have a guy you know I don't know if you\nHad to turn off the TV but then I woke up earlier before the show I Walk around one and caught up with this you know the the highlights and everything it was like wow seven and a half hours are you kidding me I could you imagine being at the park for that long and it was crazy but it was a great again\nThere was all there is also it's what I Love about baseball\nWhich that that that drama that theater\nOctober I Love I Love the sport when it when it's like this to him in\nAnd not to be greedy but that's why the playoffs should be two months [noise] your great work but that's what hurts destroy [laughter] because there's too many meaningless games where nobody cares about the result like it's just All right yeah\nIt is but it's not a name back in time for you to pitch it it's not an exact science for you to put to good teams against one another I mean if if you could have all the playoffs while I mean but even then I mean there are times there were some teams are just so far and away the doctors the Dodgers took apart the Braves it was nothing\nThat wasn't a series\nYou know what I mean that's my thing but no my my point is not that you know you ... it's called the warriors right so you're not going to have a the climactic playoff series in gains\nBut the more playoff games you had the more chances you have the playoffs the more chance you have for game last night that was the one that on a football ...\nPortugal Jeff where again like last night that was the one that on a football weekend people will talk about right like people talk about what you were worried they last night\nRight you know like ... ... what was going on I ... I I Want to talk to people just do on a high from way like they were at the game a ... [laughter] we have probably a rabbit that game but if you're at that game how incredible\n... have you read that game how you would you you couldn't possibly leave until you know the outcome you you could not be one of those what you did see or you weren't there 'cause they're how many sports moments that we had in the last decade where people leave early assuming something's gonna happen or whatever\nWe ... them are on a Lebanon am eastern on Fox Fox Sports [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAll you gotta do is become a new car member discover card will match all the cash that you

undressed get ... get a bath and still we still on so\n[laughter]\nYou're hundreds literally had all night long just a ever a game postseason game ever almost eight hours my goodness the so can believe it\nYeah it's it's it goes down in the annals as one of the\nUh one of the timeline of your life game especially if you're a Dodger fan right oh yeah well he draws you know we we have games I'd be big from Philadelphia and a a grown up with some of these sports fan\nYou I can tell you you know they shouldn't in places in the whole time to time one of your life with certain games that you will always remember that are like indelible and you're a Dodger fan particularly last night that's one of those that is automatically\n... after you know there's ... right next to it\nNo doubt it's a it's a it's an amazing amazing amazing like so because of that I Want to introduce our crew right because I noticed a Dodger fans there we have a new producer that\nWe'd like to welcome [noise] that's right [noise] I Do that we need to break in lake [noise] smash them on the\nAnd uh of course the the groove graduated and now he's working prime time Fox Sports radio and uh and then of\nCourse a triple em is off to uh the Big Ten and now we like to welcome from the blue field of Idaho Ryan Dennis\nAround we bought hey there you go I like it averaged links making it sound like I got to get jumped in to get in the end of this crew here\nWhat you do oh okay wait for it [laughter] [laughter] oh\nYeah I was just telling a in the break it it's it's been a been a while last time I I think I was here the or the birds won the super bowl but it's it's\nFor you to you and I bonded over the eagles so uh and I walk you're already fell right now though you know the normal\nPet star before we know prick your finger for a little blood and burned the sink and your mom the uh usually that's the need to pass pass but to me you know you're good to go you're going to\nPass I might give it a pass no no no [laughter]\nI got to work for it okay a couple of guys come on come on what you mean like [laughter]\nHow you doing there are you ready to go\nOh absolutely guys that are like you said it's prime time ... you know prime time in the middle of the night out here but hey it's a big Dodger went out here and you know we're finally seeing everybody get home from the freeways right now\nYeah that's a that was my question loser like there's no way or the Dodgers\nWhen you're very teetering you're about to go down three of the series is all but law and then you have the errands throw hygiene\nAnd then you winning dramatic fashion with Muncie not always be a ... or ... theories now still alive to one but you got momentum going made to pay a night game with the quick turn around what's it like from a Dodger fan\nIt's wall and yeah it's fantastic at this point and\nFrom the Dodger fan it's wall and yeah it's fantastic at this point and you know obviously with Eighteen Indians is basically to full games and they're starting pitcher evolve the he was supposed or you know he was supposed to make the starting tomorrow and now he's you know\nWho knows at this point same same kind of thing for the Dodgers so we'll see and you're right we're going to have some momentum who knows maybe we can even\nYeah I I I gotta I gotta bring him a are made the fig because you know he's a major dodger's fan I Know he's a huge Dodgers and ... what was it like for you\n[noise] very stressful extremely stressful for any Dodger fan especially those who were in attendance at that game\nA standing on pins and needles there's so many different you know highs and lows from Cody bell or to getting picked off of a base when they had a chance to do a rally and he killed that to the very next part of the ... where he saved a run gutting out the of the runner at the at least as chancellor at home or at home plate so there are so many highs and lows that go into a game like\nThis are you 'cause you're cleaning that lead Jackie Bradley use how bad the I bet the postseason he's had\nUnreal and I felt like this happens for almost any championship team there's always somebody that you don't expect\nThat comes through and plays huge for you I Know for the Dodgers last season this happened uh with them with the Austin Barnes who lost his starting ... catching job this year a back to the U.S money ground all the way the resurgence and bars because right now has been struggling\nKinda Russell did back a little bit but Barnes is one of their best postseason hitters last year I've not doing much of the regular season and you guys have you've covered this sport long enough\nOther athletes I just know for every World Series champion there's always somebody at the bottom of the order or somebody that you don't expect that has an amazing series in so far or just an amazing postseason run as a whole and that's Jackie Bradley for Boston right now\nYeah you could go back to resist the series and pick it out one of the guys came down to Cody Ross no doubt I remember\nHim oh yeah ... yeah wind your rebate for the giants to a man who didn't have the greatest\nRecognize you wrote in childhood for those kinds of guys who step off because you go there were always another dog giants yeah more than ... right right\nNo it's true\nI I mean the ... just that whole vibe\nYou know you demeaning you she ... she came back would you do it\nYou must have been a while like ooh now\nYou're going down the by the ... you're ... you're about to go down three oh series is over\nAnd that's what made it such so much more of a high stress game for the red Sox it's almost you can't afford to ... get away from you the only thing that what made it more just waiting for the red Sox is that it went this long and you had a chance and you didn't and you had to burn through all of your pitching and you have to burn through your game for starter\nOh pitch basically an entire game you pretty sick standing six and two thirds I Believe is what he pitched a before the walk off home run so that's what made it a little bit tougher from their standpoint but from the Dodgers you literally at everything on the line tonight there was no margin for error for you whereas Boston it wasn't as big of a deal\nYeah yeah All right let's we live uh for a moment ... ... ah right here I think it was\nAll they are free to [noise]\n[noise] well hey at all\n\nWent and praying\nThat have had\nThe great Charlotte Steiner on a and find them daily sports though yeah man I Love Charlie Spanish he's also now\nWhat what what a great call how bad and like I mean it was always rifle\nI mean does it does I mean look at it kept off a long marathon but again it's it's as as you mentioned it's kind of what you expect with baseball you know 'cause\nHe's a unique is all of baseball that's the beauty of baseball is that you can have in like what you're going to have a game like that some ethics game that never ends\nThat's I mean and there's there's a ton of standout performances across the board and this and this eight hour and you know in the a fiasco or you know talk about ... performance as a rookie on the biggest stage and I was ... and I have to be one of the doubt\nAnd if he if he did that brief moment that figured that brief moment or in the ... division series and we looked a little shaky and then he's been just money ever since\nNo doubt absolutely Oh absolutely yeah real yeah so and for the Dodgers this is just more of the same where they're getting a contributions from from everybody and different spots there is a different hero every night it seems like you know ... was the MVP\nOf the NFL CS he only had a couple of hits in that series but there are ... the bigger hits the biggest hits of that series so\nLife is that the team has been all year long they've had their struggles nothing has been easy for them but they keep finding a way to get victories um so it's encouraging for them look the only needs to get one you want to find a way to get a game there was always this when one game by the time as cliche as it sounds they found themselves in a position to get a win tonight\nAnd they were able to tax the Boston Red Sox pitching staff which only worse than the Dodgers favorite because they did not have to go and use rich Hill who is scheduled to be their starter for game for although oddly enough\nThis we introduced wind to you or do producer of course we did talk to ... but because remembering the trend thing I mean get a chance to introduce them fabulous and I'm an engineer and I was saying yeah there it is right now those two producer\nJim hello good morning but please don't take that as a front oh no it's All right it it only took link mentioning my name for you to remember that I exist so it's okay if I [laughter]\nI Want to push your now actually [laughter]\nActually you're right\nVery but ... ... women were wearing a goes we referenced Jew for the store and I was like damn I didn't I mean Hussein\nMy job is to stay quiet and push buttons McGough thank God at all you like to ... shut all planned I push buttons dribble exile right um no it's interesting with that Dodger crowd and you and it's fun to kind of borrowed a term from Gulf and say that\nBack nine you know if the of the game the ... of those innings there and and just the the fans just it was almost empty by I mean not not empty but it was very a lot of fans had left just because\nI don't know for whatever reason they're exhausted at the end of the lives that well there via [laughter] if you're paying like five dollars to the end there if you're paying five hundred dollars or a thousand dollars for a ticket to the world series I mean hey you're getting your money's worth right you're getting two games in one\nA guy you know you know people get really chilly when it reaches sixty degrees out here so maybe the people needed a sweater and couldn't take it anymore so they had to hit the hit the road so oh my God the lottery so many so many athletes were empty by the end of that game and it was sort of like\nA man he missed the one hell of an ending there so\nYeah as you might as well we've been small problem Dodger fan is they'll roll on\nBig big like jobs and leave early Miami Heat fans remember was it like they they come back in a playoff game or something and they some of them have left for the yeah I don't understand that some ... right yeah I looked at those people\nWho were playoff game you're you're at the world series I Believe it would be the world's well once again\nBut it is it is though a an eight hour a fair I mean that uh I don't care ethics at Santa Cruz game you know I ... I I have to\nGo on but here's the thing would you leave a movie before the movie's over\nI'm\nMad as some of the whole movie seven and a half hours yes [laughter] even the godfather originally had an intermission cubs come on that's gotta be a little I was wrong with that we're wondering I chose to show if the umpires were even allowed to use the bathroom or like they're holding it or not you know\nThat's a that's rough you're you know you're going to get your ... dug out the the you know I Hope one at a ... tough quick relief why\nWe got we got to get to some football coming up next in our weekly raider report is coming up from Lincoln ... hold you do is everybody\nRemember a lot about that I really fell is\nWhat you got to the ad regard I got to get out with you on Fox Sports radio\nNews breaks won't catch\nUs by surprise um um um that color your Fox Sports radio is a completely different place for this is something that you have a passion for entertainment well we're going to do is give you something a little different we are Fox Sports radio\nAnd I think that's it\nIf you suffer from E.

territory marching blanks laying\nContest the Laker fans are all having has got to go out the door with the trash to day [laughter] I don't understand it I Do not understand why do you understand this\nYou know really I mean this is happening I kinda understand\nIt because Kobe fans feel like liberal on\nBasically moved Coby out of the conversation when it came to the greatest of all the time that it was Jordan was made Kobe fans believe the Coby was right after Jordan because six raised in five rings\nAnd all of a sudden now is just Jordan and live Ron okay and Coby is not going that in the conversation okay\nUm you know the Terminator series and the movies\n[noise] yeah yeah you know on one of them like Arnold Schwarzenegger sweaters and becomes like the good guy so even if he is one of your competitors your adversaries if he is the greatest that what he does and he shows up to help\n...\nJust let him\nThe Lakers are the most interesting they've been in six years it's not close\nThey're going to end the year with the best record they've had in about five or six years it's not close and what are we talking about here the stories the other night when the Lakers by the way got a really nice way and against Denver down to if they're good players because they all got into a fist fight with the rockets the week before there was a story we get\n[noise] who the Lakers beat now gets Coby was attendance nobody was there\nHe watched him he watched la Braun play in a lake or uniform and then after the game\nYou went over and he said something to look at the facial expressions on Kobe them abroad as the two of them are inside the house the Kobe build\nBut what prompts wearing the jerseys Kobe used to wear look at them look at the way they're looking at each other just Kobe like him Kobe ... actually acting like he like somebody actually hate to hate them does he like him or does he like in ... this is the most annoying I mean high school was mature compared to what we're doing right now\nIn the world of Laker fans I never heard\nPhiladelphia called doctor Jay to ask him if it was okay to bend sending got drafted I never heard Boston Cole Larry Bird I'm Sorry Larry said OK and Jason Tatum is good because I Do ride\nHow we we signed Gordon Hayward is that okay with you 'cause he's white and you can also and that's kind of like you is that okay what do you remember serious Bucky what\nOn God's green earth are we doing right now\nI mean we just always trying to pay homage to the great well what I was a statue [laughter] there's a ... and the raptors you always got about out\nOf a bronze statue in about three or four cities by the time those old things over\nBut he doesn't yet right now he's on uh Kobe's team Kobe's team they're healthy Coby built staples statue to jerseys and the rafters ... hey you got out he has to really ... yes history\nWe didn't even see this in the NFL with Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck we didn't even see this and pain was still on the team they caught him they caught\n[laughter] one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time they caught him\nAnd drafted a new guy and I didn't hear one cold than be like a excuse me a Andrew\nUh I just would like you to know what city you're walking into what Jersey and what position you're walking into you better respect theirs because if you don't I Hope you know you're not one of us yet\nYou are not one of us yet because this is the house the pay ... did you ever hear anybody saying that in Indianapolis\n[noise] ah yeah I mean kind of they talked about this bin ... they got a huge statue out front of the outlook of soil stadium a everyone can associate the Indianapolis Colts with pay manic so yeah I mean he kept the large that over there\nYeah he did but nobody ever like did not have their arms open to welcome Andrew Luck nobody ever but you know let's go back to the line of questioning that we saw pre season\nUm when a when\nThe reporters like hey ah so how are you going to kind of a you know indoctrinate yourself to Laker fan the bronze like\n[laughter] me [laughter] he's like who who me\nIs that really aware that that's LeBron James and I know what Laker fans are saying you got to win a ring or else it's a failure great great it's been five games he can't win a ring yet\nYou got to calm down Kobe Bryant has tried he's tried to get everybody to calm down it's like come on his side I'm On his team I'm Glad to hear whether he's being genuine are not quite frankly who cares\nWho cares this is the greatest player in basketball today he is definitely in the conversation for greatest player ever if you don't believe that go take a look at the Cavaliers box scores this year and tell me I'm wrong\nHe ... and the fact that he's not being welcomed with open arms by all and more importantly the fact that Laker fans in more addicted to a false soap opera\nThan the actual games that are being played which by the way are entertaining for the first time in five years is beyond me and quite frankly I work at a Laker fan in the eyes just tell them this is not speak worldview it just doesn't your team is good\nTo be a fair and be a fan of the team nobody nobody else to turn in their Colby card to root for all abroad and the Lakers and twenty Eighteen\nYeah but when we became this debate coach where everyone wanted a debate about who's better than home going back and forth having arguments people building cases where they got\nThey made it harder for fans to be able to say I'm a Kobe fan but I'm Down to brown because Brian is here because even though they weren't pitted against each other they didn't match up against each other and the finals there's still some of that rivalry between does fan base is because it's Kobe next in line behind Jordan\nIn does fan base is because\nIt's Kobe next in line behind Jordan and he'll be on the line\nBut that's not being a Laker fan in but there's something a Laker fan I mean I couldn't I couldn't I make the argument Bucky uh everybody ribs Kevin ran for going to the warriors the year before I actually just months before he had been beaten by the warriors in a series where he was up three to one\nMhm so couldn't we say that Steph Curry and ... Thompson and dream on green and the two teams were being compared with one another\nWho's better was rather staff would you rather have Katie Katie didn't blink is like okay now I'm going to switch teams there's not one warrior fan on God's green earth was like whoa oh see I have to break their Katie All right we've got to step in play and\nProgressive as new home quote explore was built to save you time and money by allowing you to compare multiple quote options all on line to head to progressive dot com today and see if you can say\nHardwood bucking bronco mark wheeler box sports radio boss he rose or you wrote some interesting things on a on the raiders situation will get to that coming up in a little bit\nAnd I thought we can start talking about the raiders right now with French while the NFL writer Yahoo Sports who joins us now live Frank really appreciate you coming on\nWhat what is the view right now of what the raiders are doing I sort of understand\nOr rebuild in the post ... trade I don't really understand I still to this day don't understand the ... power NFL people assessing what John Bruning company or doing\nYou know I think that you almost have to separate the Mac trade and just say it was a mistake I I guess maybe the raiders don't feel that way because they did it but ... if you'd separate out everything else they've done I mean\nWe can criticize some of it for sure but\nThey apply for a strong picks the next two years there they're going to be able to rebuild this thing I you know getting a first check for the first round pick our mark Cooper I thought was excellent I I don't think I'm already Cooper who's had four games of was Seventeen are those fears or the first round pick but we'll see what the hell is and I I just think that\nThere is a pass for the raiders to rebuild and get better I I don't ... it probably comes around and\nGetting something out of the Carr Fire replacement for polio Mac which was difficult but the match right just loomed over everything because they just don't give up a generally racial player like that which which they did that I think that set them back pretty big\nYou know speaking to the you talked about the raiders seven five first round picks um is it up to ... when you go back and looked at John grew to history or when it comes to fix it hasn't been great how confident are you that he is a guy that can do review especially if we're thinking just rebuild is going to occur through the ...\nYeah and that's ... that's a ... you can have five ... need to have the right guy to ... I don't know I I mean the raiders you know Richard McKenzie a great either if you look for the call Joseph Gehring calmly these guys are they're not getting much out of them and that that's not good it's not good at all for them\nAnd I just wonder I you know it it's hard to miss on all five too though [laughter] take enough you thinking of throws at the airport you're going to hit on a couple at least so you know it's I I think that I think we had an advocate main thing I feel about current in any way\nIs it's fun to pile on him it's fun to make the jokes everybody's doing it\nI think we need to get a little bit of time I get a Mac trade again that's almost separate it's almost a separate economy at this point than everything else they everybody realizes that was a mistake\nBut I think other than that rescue crews and a shot at least dig it was all part of this whole idea of what seven games into a ten year contract I Would see what he can do nothing\nI mean nobody's impressed me so far nothing short and perhaps many people so far out on some other graphics that OK already you know somebody like that and her ... and so\nThere's been some progress I think we need to give him a little bit of patients so security can do\nBryce Rob with Yahoo on the NFL joining us on Fox Sports radio a Frank these huge and Texans on Thursday night want a bunch of people some uh you know their fantasy games and and they won five in a row and so now everybody seems to be really hot on on Houston\nBut what what is the read on the progression of just watch them back from injury and how might they be affected by war will fall or not being out to the year\nIt's huge I don't know that they really have anybody to replace well for here is just a difference maker you might not put up the stats Andre Hopkins in other super gather happens us but he he takes the top off of defense you need a guy like that the structure feel especially on Watson who is so good on the people I\nIt's funny what are we talking about the the Columbine oh you know the the velocity on his throes of from the radar gun is not going to the arm strength and here he is he's in maybe the best people throw in the NFL earliest it up there so not having a folder and you're off and it doesn't affect them a lot but\nI don't know what to make it attracts them at this point I really don't drop\nIn lines terrible that that that has to be mentioned up\nFront that's not a good thing or the defense of good and now Watson looks like this\nAnd I turned up front that's not a good thing or the defense of good and not watch and looks like he's finally comfortable he finally looks like he's beyond the what you know whatever issues they had coming back from the ACL the other one for in a row great for them but I you know\nThey beat Indianapolis I'm Frank right wing for when they shouldn't they did the cowboys were chasing Garrett didn't go for it when he should have this team back I don't know I'm I'm I'm just curious the taxes are came to ... me but if the ... and we saw on Thursday it that's where we're getting in and they're going to win this division and be a contender [noise]\nYou know we can't do quarterbacks without talking about pets more homes or what do you think about pets and homes and what he's been able to do with the Kansas City chiefs who just want\nYou know I don't know about you guys but I Can't come up with and maybe it's Marino all the way back to Dan Marino I'm Guy who is married\nKind of a command of the position with a physical skills in his early in his career\nThis young of an age usually you know I started to really mastered a position when their\nPhysical still skills start to drop a little badly I guess at Rogers it you know he was still well within his crime when he started to get it but I see my homes and I thought it was it a pre season I'm sure you guys did too especially the ... the person was high opener for me where I saw\nWhile this guy isn't just a big arm you know he's going to throw the ball through the wall he ... he understands this progression he understands where to go with the ball he understands what Andy Reid wants them to do in this off and\nI said wow this is pretty impressive from a young guy let's say that that carries over regular season ain't got even better I think I'm going away by this guy and I realize there are some blowback of oh why we crony I'm so early well the reason is that there's no reason to believe this is the flu key is\nThe here could only young quarterback as I remember at that stage jak 'cause he's just married the immense critical guess with the mental commander the position it's really a precedent hey let's also let's get around to read some credit to I mean he lost it all sounds a coordinator obviously not nature that\nChicago Bears I think we have to get Andy On which a bit of credit for pattern of homes development and if I was speaking culturally here right now I began to read simply because he deserves a lot of credit for what ... homes with done so far\nRice Rahman Yahoo is with us on Fox Sports radio Frank all the talk of a team going to London every time we hear it it yeah you know getting closer and closer are we really getting closer who's going how are they pulling this off at the top putting it all\nI don't I hate that I have since\nDay one you're going to have such a difficult time feeling a competitive team in London and\nWhy it's just greed to me it's just kind of fell agreed to it it's great for them to have any ... any regular season games in London to maybe I'm just a nerd when it comes to the schedule and wanting everything to be you know everybody's got equal equal shares and all that but\nYou're getting some team seven home game so how does have eight and that's not fair that's not cool I don't just what age expand your brand in England a little bit so instead of Thirteen million and you make Thirteen point one billion I I I just don't get it I\nI never understood the London fascination I Know they have fans there I Know that they like and I felt football there but not sending a Premier League team to oh why why are we sending NFL\nTeam to that [laughter] I don't get\nParents I don't I don't understand the fascination I really truly don't I don't think it makes a leak that or wherever team you send over there you're going to have to make such concessions to make them competitive for\nSolar free agents I what are you going to give them a higher salary cap and everybody else but I mean I just [laughter] I just can't imagine if you have the choice of playing in\nChicago or Houston or London\nUnless you're really adventurous ... why pick London unless you have some ties there I I just don't get this ain't revel why this makes sense and I don't think it\nBrings the NFL from Ghana Thirteen billion dollar industry to twenty and she's just [noise] it is very marginal and I don't get why does the un it oh it but it's I think it's going to happen some day just 'cause the NFL she inspects\nNight and yeah So Frank out real quick you tell me a decade from now the jaguars play where and the chargers play where\nThey're crazy question I have no idea where the chargers play but it's not LA I really don't believe so and I do it the jaguars or weapons team I just think that they're setting us up and they ... playing these tracks for a long time [noise]\nFrank great great to have you thank you that's what it calls I appreciate\nIt OK race Rob NFL on Yahoo joining us Fox Sports radio I don't know where it's going to be

worth I think it is a sham but the wild card games are actually interesting and fun to watch\nYou know I mean I think they should be series no no there's no doubt about it but I'm I'm just saying at least they were decent games for the most part you know they were they they they were good and then you know for ... it it seems a little bit um\nI guess what is what's the word I'm looking for it it seems like it doesn't have a lot of inspiration is the first couple of games because like\nI watch the Milwaukee game yesterday and it was good for a couple of innings and then\nYou know the Colorado kind of lost it you know the sort of they and their guys weren't hitting you expected ice right to see a lot of hitting from Iraqis as far as I was one nothing a feeling yeah yeah yeah so you know I I understand the purest out there that like you know good defense good pitching and all that other stuff I'm\nI'm I'm just one of those I Want to see you know I might I might ladies tricks thing along

four games yesterday\nUh all the favorites when all the home teams wing yesterday right and uh it was it was starts with Berlin's are linked ha ha and throws my God and offend me champions meant he would say she'll man in these teams legit I Love that in the middle of that line up\nAnd they were uh the Bruins are\n[noise] he can just be nasty nasty stuff that was the end and that you know that

might have been you know I haven't paid a whole lot of attention to baseball this season but they might have gone through it a little bit quiet or if you will the whole season and now they're you know the put themselves into it but what they did to the clover and those Indians who my goodness it's\nYeah and look they start off early right bringing home run there and and Springer and now to pay for nothing in the fifth inning\nThe or the tribe comes back to make it forward to\nBut then a lemon seventh happen then they and they tag on a two more and that's the ball game right there\nSo that's the first game of the day the second day the game is the second day a ... game today link\nIs what you'd reference Milwaukee Colorado and I think you're right and then everybody expected that to being offensive series yet ride around looking out on paper I just saw ... yeah you know Milwaukee's a team that can that compound the ball and obviously so or the Rockies particularly\nWhen they go home and look it was changed the against Anderson yeah and if there's ever going to be some off and she thought it was going to be against us eight or ... yeah and yeah but you know when there's the problem is chasing pitch well you skate some wild in this but he pitched well and again they that walk\nThe bullpen it's game over if you live and that's why I think they can come out of the national league because as good as the Dodgers are if they have a lead they're on top of all because of their bullpen\nBecause they come at you they got to worry a ... and of course I ... and Jeffrey's and you know they they can just that they can just end the game early this artist allowed to go deep way\nYeah yeah and you talk about the strategy that goes into a you know what the what these managers do

looked good early my gosh right his stuff\nOn the way the bottom of follow the ball when he was like you look like what's curling right over to the plate and it just drop I mean it was unbelievable I was watching it from the airport in and and before I didn't have it on a plane but I was watching it from the airport and he has some just wasted stuff in the first the first couple of innings\nIt was yeah I mean night at eight strike out now he goes five in the third and it was interesting because Jay happened pitched really\nWell against the red socks this year yeah and Jay have owned the Sox\nAre career why write a bad first dating they jump all over all ... Martinez who has been you know the to me that he was the signing of the all seeing all the difference right yeah and he has been all year long\nHe eats a three run Homer to get it all started\nThere were all five nothing yeah\nAnd then they have to hold on it gets dicey arid judge lead off home more than nine to make the five four\nBut ... and he changed three straight pitch it yeah that second pitch was a cookie right daddy daddy chopped for a strike and then the ... then they get them on a on a on a curve\nBall that that just drops out and freeze in their\n... ... it was ... at the temporal ...\nRight after when he took that ... the old ones fast ball down the metal that force team or I was I was shocked and then you know and he strikes out in the voice out strikes out then the red Sox hold on to win game on\nThis may well you know what it is a great time of year you know hockey started when I landed in LA I think the kings were playing the sharks I saw that on the TV\nOr watch the end of the Dodgers game I mean those are so ... it's it's a great time of year we talked about October is a great my\nBeat out and that it's it's the best the Dodgers\nThe Dodgers were a are dominant right the Dodgers just started just of another clash with the Braves gr Shaw was ridiculous last night and talked about you mentioned him at the start of Clinton curse Shaw meant eight innings\nOnly three strike that's what he was economical his pitches ... eighty five pitches ... eight innings is shut out ball just choose heads he gives up\n... ... just shut out ball just choose hits he gets up a lead off double to cool to match it other than a than a and then feel to hit yeah the rest of the way man you\nNeeded it gave me you know reassurance at what an ace is supposed to look like I mean and it doesn't always have to be\nThe caves up there we just talk about but you talk about a true ways as you mentioned managers himself for all those innings you don't see a lot of that in these days you don't see a lot of pitchers going distance because they're the big way managers or should treat him a ball counts and all this other stuff but he\nWas a true ways last night Matty would hit the big home run yeah and that gets started\nLook I I don't know how I don't know how to [laughter] I'm a breath bridges can't compete against no I ... yeah yeah and I was wondering I I'll be\nVideo of the I don't even know what it was it looked like the guys weren't offensive mass or something like that in this kind of it's kind of freaky I didn't notice that one I didn't see that one\nOr two was freaky I said earlier you know if you if you buy me a favor right but you any body solve this cause like if anybody knows this dude and has an idea of what or who the guy was\nPlease let me know because you're H freaking me out the guy was should the third base side of home plate next to this blond he's got to put on and like links said out of fencing type of\nMath he looked like ... ... what you look like it was we were like ... the Greek [noise] did you\nI did it look like each he was sitting in the front row it ... it looked like ET was sitting in the front row\nI mean it was crazy I was like I couldn't I couldn't control in the game to watch you to do that oh my God\nThe things that things that people do behind home plate like I was I was saying that there was um I was watching the the bird game\nBecause the umpire Katie is a good friend of mine who smoked cigars go used to live in Phoenix um uh and he was doing I was so proud to see my plate and then and then and then to the left of him there was this blonde lady had short blond hair and there was this guy I think he was wearing them\nI think it was when it ... or something you were ... he stood out but the the reason why was the ladies stood out short blond is every time she wanted to ... to do something\nOr you know like get a strike out or hit a big hit it hit the ball to put our hands together you remembered I Dream of Jeannie away Jeannie blinked magic she would do that every time one for every pitch\nAnd it caught my eye was like wow really you think you think you have control over it and so she kept going up forever [laughter] and that's what it is one stood out in the Milwaukee oh my\nGod oh that's great yeah I mean you're you're right that this one just just got me a you know I was Tam or find sound engineer so I Would say did did you see the video\nOr of the ghoulish a narrow [laughter] I just ... you didn't watch the game live ah no I didn't catch that one was good that is a it's creepy I don't know what what's the deal with that person is it looked like maybe they had like a ... mosquito net over their face\nAnd I understand I I don't go out there yeah I don't know if it did you watch it do you where you're distracted by did you see it\nI honestly do not see it to be honest with you I miss that you don't want to make that part I watch the game balls in and out I was doing a lot at once I was working as a game or the ...\nI Am the fake I'm watching the game and like all of us I Can't stop looking at this thing so then I started to wonder\nSo I was getting my friends are Bob them like you know you see that's what's going on then I start to wonder what's that Tom Brady at the game\nLike Tom Brady that want to be seen so yeah the ... at the fed and I think that at all\n[noise] the bigger the bigger question who's the blonde you're sitting next [laughter]\nBecause of ... which is [laughter]\nYeah right right right yeah but I don't even know when she was whether\nWell as they were close enough you know given by association [laughter]\nHave been Brady was\nLike this during your GED past ... says I Want to go she decides Yankees\nHe's big time and he's got a couple of boxes probably for himself now\nWell and this is ... linked just sent it to him here I'm\nLike a man without a face [laughter] going on while that is really creepy\nShe first I thought I was wondering is it the network\nBugs and the guy I think so because they look like hey look I'm I'm right now more than a front\nRow behind on play but I don't want to be seen so could you block my face oh\nI see somebody like about it on by it was somebody of somebody who's ... ... ... I don't know\nI I didn't I wasn't sure the ... winter yeah there is if any body ... nose up this man of this ghoulish figure where you sit next to the game that I didn't I\nOf this goal which figure where you sit next to the game\nThat I didn't I didn't know what the deal is it I mean not [laughter] or their fear age seven seven nine of Fox by the way they re just eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox if you had theories evil right it is\nBecause he freaking me out may it's freaking me out man it's freaking me out like you have no idea\nIt's freaking me out ... years out by that time it is\nI Love October I Do I Love it I Love October I Love October for one reason\nAll the sports collide he's right it's a great college in of all the sports my favorite month of the year October isn't\nThat's nice my love and I'm at I'm Eileen fan so I'll be honest with you know you go do what the way you dress up as what he would he would he would he's on his I dress up every year by what are what are you going to tell you that they do I don't know whatever the kids you know I I like the kids choose my costume right okay so whatever they want I last year I was a a\nSome sort of the dinosaur figure can solve that some craziness going sometimes or\nThat the the the the big one wanted me to wear so I go wherever they like what they like it is a big Jay of college football huh\nAnd uh just just to get you up a little bit of this it's coming from 'cause there's some really good early games obviously Texas Oklahoma Red River rivalry yeah and I'm I'm curious because Texas place you'd come football man surprising\nSo I didn't think Texas additive him ah especially when you see the way they started against Maryland but since then they have played some good football in Oklahoma for what it's worth with all the talent they have and of course they have some injuries is issues as well\nBut for all the talent that they have it seems like Oklahoma has a net terrible knack of letting people hang around or just make things interesting it's her they're not as lights out as you would think there would be so this could get a very interesting and we see now things are bounce to the underdog or the other side if you will many a times uh in especially in this series\nYeah look you know we all saw army and army hanging around push Oklahoma overtime yeah yeah\nSo I always stayed hung around on on even usually early hung around bell or for up until the fourth quarter yeah ... was in the game against Oklahoma so I'm curious to see their taxes could keep ... I I'm I have my doubts\nBut I'm curious to see if taxes can connect with them well of course\nYeah I mean I I think we're right now to this point the most impressive when is there went over TCU right yeah I'm In you know and and you look at them and they have enough for a four game win streak says they drop that want to Marilyn their hot or do they have enough to to stay with them for four corners that's that's the big S.\nIt's a big question the\nAh there's some there's some good games today though uh ... again ... Texas and Oklahoma we talked about Ella shoe and Florida number five dollars should I still think that's too high for him against the twenty second ranked Florida Gators\nI I I'm\nHaving trouble reading this game Florida and LSU yeah\nWell Florida has a hard time getting her off and started sometimes and you know LSU has their issues are scoring so expect a low scoring game if that if that's the case then that definitely favors the the the tigers\nYou thanks have slowly you think it favors the\nThe if it if it's if it's a low scoring game I mean it's it's a big if it which team's going to show up 'cause I I like ... defense but you know off its essence on some trouble guards on arts I'm getting\nIn and look for is often says no joke is is you know juggernaut either ... right right he drew Miller Leighton\nYeah\nMm they I'm I'm ... I'm curious because all those quick passes\nThey're not going to work against ... that's not going to work in sales you know I think ... they ... on a tight yeah on the receivers\nThat I I'm not sold on Florida's office of line and whether or not they can handle that demeans the difference maker for LSU yeah have you and I ... you like kind of see the same way Miami, Florida state's is always a fun one chains they see for forty states used the\nMask one yeah yeah yeah for the state struggling I I think Miami I think Miami mainly for for the fact that it's that in state rivalry that that takes over there I think I think we'll see it a good\nGame out of Miami Today yeah yeah\nI I think you're right or burn Mississippi State tonight when now but good game are you waiting for all burns it really kind of flex\nI was thinking well sooner or later you're gonna have to find a way to separate themselves before they get ready for the big game against Alabama right I mean because you know as dominant as Alabama looks you know you're trying to figure out who can possibly challenge them who's going to make things interesting how the less I in in you know\nBe a fan of unimpressive I I look they beat why she started to season which was a good when right\nWhy she came back and became must we forget yeah yeah yeah they came back a little bit of Washington and have their problems in the red zone and three trips down there and I think and I can't remember nine points so they lose to el issue at home and uh and and and again going back and forth\nThey beat Arkansas and it was not very good and uh\nAnd we're just like wondering what that what the heck was that because you guys know I'm In Ohio State fan I I was shocked that Ohio State even had a chance and again because they were awful for most of that game\nOffensively they could move the ball\nPenn State's defense we all thought it was going to be an up and down shootout like the big twelve it was it was a competitive it ... it wasn't even really competitive\nAnd then all of a sudden in the fourth quarter penalty ... one of the quarterback was horrible yeah yeah yeah Haskins horrible yeah Haskins just got it there was pressure to face every single a bright lights yeah he yeah he melted had one of those orally now did everything he possibly could end the biggest problem that I\nWith that final play yes it was read option and he had the option to hit you shouldn't have even been in that situation you've got treatment solely was putting out like a Heisman level performance like he was doing everything and the decision was made read option and they hand off the ball it made zero sense to me\nIf you're going to find your they're fit worked we wouldn't be talking about it\nWell I mean that's that's all you but I got to do what they call it was a horrible cough and ... all your work that out\nSo I but if it works is still terrible call\n... ... I was fan Anthony this fan he was very polite he just said it was dead quiet and airplanes some country songs planners to our Sinatra's plan over loudspeakers is I Love you coach said the terrible call\nAnd James frankly it was maybe about Fifteen feet away twenty feet away and if if he hadn't been restrained I bet Franklin runs up to the to the\nTo the the only man because the families right the famous writer wherever he wasn't going to like get\nInto the he wasn't going to get into stand the test but other than going to do y'all the guy he was ... due to Adam\nYeah and he was it wasn't even that bad of a sort of a heckling it was just sort of like love your coach but it was a terrible call man Franklin just gotta night it was a he's had to run back in there so\nDon't be mad at you blew it conflict or not and I saw a ...

hasn't really\nGone away or you do you buy and all of this idea that that everything the\nHarlem ... doing sort of gives you a momentary pause about what Baker Mayfield achieved at Oklahoma\nOh I think you have the dignity consideration I'm after a while you you begin to look look bigger ... tremendous don't tell the Murray has tremendous don't um but when you do see these numbers the numbers are kind of parallel you do wonder how many how much of that is due to a system maybe elevating the plate yeah Jenny\nBeth was there she joins us now live on Fox Sports radio with a later\nAfter sexism Oklahoma guinea is so great to have you and I I Know sexist one but we got to start with ... ah did anybody\nYou know check in with him and said are you sure you don't want to play football at the next level or are we sure about that\nOh boy this kid is impressive I I think that's what's crazy first of all thanks for having me guys I'm you know Kylah or was this storyline heading into this one and unfortunately he's going to look back and think of those\nCritical turnovers and he's going to think twice about this performance but what we saw from him in terms of his athleticism like that Seventy seven yard\nA touchdown pass the Hollywood that was incredible then we saw that sixty seven yard run for the score and the fourth quarter that was I mean\nThe guy's an athlete and you know we talk so much about his future as a baseball player but you know how can you not look at how\nTalented he is as a quarterback of the football team so it's really something is going to be thinking about the last I checked with him personally baseball was all the uh all about the future for him but he wanted to take this Oklahoma teamed far I Know he'll be bond with\nThis performance night in terms of those turnovers\nWith a flip it on the other side with Texas Longhorns do this I knew that it could be close but I don't know if there are many people that do judge who could really knock off Oklahoma\nWell what's cool about this Texas team 'cause we've now been around them for a little bit and you know you look at that first law against Maryland which that was a\nVery interesting game Maryland was playing for a a falling teammates they had these horrible weather delays there was a lot of interesting circumstances to that match or benefits\nYou know the first the first weekend for for Texas but since that game um I feel like they've just found their identity and a different way and\nSomething coach Herman said to me when I interviewed him post game he said we figured out how to finish and we finished today and yes they did allow Oklahoma back in the next and that fourth quarter but this team is playing inspired and the players all week you can sense the confidence that's what I got from that and they were saying we want to play this game\nWe've been waiting to prove what Texas is about and I didn't really get that in the last couple of years with the Texas football team and it just proves that over time and ... what ... doing is working for the program Jimmy\nThey keep surprising us you know you mentioned that Mary Adrian but we've also we've learned over the years in college football that if you make your mistake really early ... there's time to recover from that and now when you don't wins over us here in DC you in Oklahoma\nAnd uh you know some other interesting opportunities Oklahoma states still ahead on the schedule\nOr the Texas Longhorn him a mixed year for the national championship\nBoy I think that if we asked them that they'd probably say hold up let's just wait to see because there's a few other big games they've got coming in terms of the conference but are they you know taking the driver seat in the big twelve absolutely and a guy like\nI I got to look to their quarterback and Salinger because\nI think that he's been criticized last year and this is a player that not only is respected by his teammates and coach is just the confidence he's playing with five total TVs today three hundred and eighty six totally arts I'm pretty sure that the career high for the guy but just\nLet us as always thought from collar but the guy was moving we saw the legs get going and um the way he's been able to kind of command the often is something that has really been a difference for the team and I think that they're responding well to him as the leader and they have high expectations are the group\nI'm over the last few weeks it seems like there's been a little bit of a change in terms of the office of political overtime Herman maybe injecting himself more into that is this something that is true if you take in more ownership remote control the office of reason which because it appears that the officers playing better\n[noise] well he you know what he did say last week he had to take over some of those calls which did happened last week the reference of coordinator was set cans of a fluke\nKind of a visit to the hospital so\nHe was not I'm with them but he said he was a bit too conservative in the past with them and the two of just kind of developed a different kind of trust\nThat they feel like they equally are good each other and just are feeling more comfortable together so I think a lot of ways it's just a more comfortable often as a whole and they're willing to take some of those chances that maybe they weren't able to do before and the damage showing that he can be that guy for them\nJourney did you get a chance to talk to any Texas fans who sort of a I think now feel like the program as a whole\nHas turned the corner you know I I'm always interesting when you have a a a real blue chip type program like this I Am a fan base has gone through a few years of feeling like this is not up to our standards I'm always aware of like women that moment that they sort of feel like we're back is today it\nWell you know I got that sense from the fans that one of course they're going to celebrate the victory but I think the fear is if you look at the fact that it was forty five\nTwenty four heading into the fourth and\nOklahoma called their way back into this I mean it was we we were down to the very on there and it could have been a very different outcomes are\nAnd I think that's the that's the one place for the fans are going to fear that they still need to be better but light coach for him and said we found a way to finish and that's what they're going to build on after that but the fan base was excited and I mean just the\nRed River okay and this was my first time first time covering it just to see the Oklahoma fans and the ... fans were at the Texas state fair\nAt the cotton ball I mean I don't know if it gets better honestly this is an instant classic that I'm Still kind of coming down from because the energy in the atmosphere with something I have never serious\nYou know Jenny and thinking about Oklahoma coming off this law do they believe or do they have the sense that it still can buy their way back into the playoff contention\nYou know I I talk to their S. I. D. post game and he said that Lincoln had some really powerful words in the last\nAnd um and he said that Lincoln had some really powerful words in the locker room and he said he handled it really well and this is a team that I think in two thousand six when they lie to protect the last time I think that in the team they ended up going on\nTo the playoffs and I think I I'm pretty sure that number sounds\nRight I I I Know that they've rebounded post there and look at this team could went out and meet taxes again and that championship game which can be pretty special so\nI I don't want to doubt Oklahoma I think unfortunately the center's lead that and the question mark and it's going to remain when you allow it seemed like that put up forty eight against yeah that's going to be something you're going to be thinking about and they made a lot of improvements there I Know that the the leaders of that defense guys like cat Murray they're not going to please and that man with that performance\n[noise] we have not I am eastern\nSix specific on Fox Sports radio\n[noise] check out\nHis name's Collin Keller great she I said please don't godly Tom Parker might harm it Archie

Seventy that number twenty four\nBoise State don't call the Boise Boise Boise\nI used to live there for a couple of summers that some a minor league baseball broadcast\nOh did you local knowledge Boise which yes one of those things everybody calls the Boise a and that's the that's the locals way of knowing what an outsider's and you're like oh you called the Boise\nA we call this guy Bill Hancock is the executive director of the college football playoff\nKind enough to join us today bill we really appreciate it thank you so much\nI I was really struck by uh the interview and quotes that you gave about a week and a half ago with regard to for instance some of the group of five schools like central Florida and you stated that in your opinion they do have a path\nTo the college football playoff I I'm not sure I really see that can you explain what what their past might be\nWell two things first thank you for having me on yes secondly you're the knowledge one of my pet peeves because there is no street in Boise\nThat's right oh I S a F you see their point was from a really was funny because I when I moved there I'd never been there and I get there and I'm watching the news one night\nAnd and the the age or says Boise and I go [laughter] she talks about like what is not and and so\nAnd then the next day her did it again and they did it again and again and so I started asking him why have the the rest of us all just been doing this wrong and they're like yeah pretty much [laughter] okay I Walk anymore\nOh that's in theater and I'll tell you one of one of my favorite places actually when I was director the NCA tournament teams would get assigned there and they would complain about it until they went there and they would come back and then they would say wow what a great play\nNo doubt about it when I found out I was moving there I ended up getting paranoid guy on the golf course one time I told them I was going to do at the time I said Boise and uh he goes oh boy who goes that's kinda like Bakersfield and not nothing against Bakersfield but when I got to Boise I'm like\nYeah that's not like Bakersfield at all that that's [laughter] there's nothing similar about those two places except for the pie in front of their name I'm not sure that guy had been to\nEither more or less right All right All right well thank you for doing it so so yeah I couldn't go you please a ... on that idea of the group of five teams\nYeah happy to do that frankly when your game probably a good schedule when your games and you're going to be in the\nUm and there is no better example than Houston two or three years ago they had it all to eat up they had a great victory over Oklahoma\nThey were they were rolling that they they were all set and then of course they had the unfortunate last that navy and I think they lost to SMU later on but it it can be done play a good schedule when your games and and you're just you're being\nDoes play a good schedule when your games and and you'll just you'll be in the heart\nYou know it's oh it's so early to speculate but right now it seems like the usual suspects are in contention Alabama Georgia Ohio State Clemson I'm for you guys when you look at the layoff does it ever get boring potentially seeing the same themes in those four spots\n[noise] [noise] oh my goodness not not for the committee now not for us or it's just a matter of evaluating the resumes evaluating the games that we watch on on video\nAnd now it's not boring at all it's just it's exciting actually what what we're in a phase there's no doubt where\nAlabama and and Clemson are in a very positive cycle so Ohio State so as Oklahoma Denver ... college football college football so I worked in cycles and and that will be that will continue to be the case\nBill Hancock executive director college football playoff joining us so a bill ... let me let me continue in fact and and ask about a team like central Florida which is you said you know play good schedule with all your games will be in the hard certainly people could ask about the teams that are on their schedule although there's only so much that's in their control they did with all of their games\nUm and and I looked at them and what happens is the following year for instance it feels like the polls at the beginning of the year certainly take into account what a team did the year before because what else do we know when teams are zero in zero however central Florida\nAt the end of the year last year they they win a game like all bird and then they came back the following year and dropped about Fifteen spots in the pre season polls and now have to climb their way back up again so what's the deal there\nWhich is why the committee doesn't use ... to the polls that all we don't pay any attention to those calls a ... and you always talked about that at this I Know those polls are great for promoting the game\nThe great to get excited about their teams before the season but the preseason polls on me but they don't mean anything\nBecause you're right it's based on what happened last year and and maybe based on whether they have a quarterback returning that we just don't pay any attention to them\nYou know in in thinking about quarterbacks I'm looking at it seemed like a Notre Dame who's made a quarterback change with in both they're more exciting obviously when officers because there are a little more balanced but they're sending a nice position right now when you look at the fighting fires in the fact that they're playing an independent schedule where does some of the things that you're looking forward to separate them from a team that plays in a conference\n[noise] hard for me to talk about specific teams that I don't usually like to do it but I I I Would just say\nIt it's it's the same way we evaluate all team's strength is scheduled do they have at at games against the other teams that are in the race what about common opponent and and none of them will be evaluated the very same white\nYou know the comment about Notre Dame reminded me of something if you went on the basis of returning quarterback look at the teams\nAs last year that didn't finished with the same quarter back they started with um and I would say Alabama and Georgia is it pretty well [laughter]\nA Bill Hancock a executive director college football playoff joining us uh they'll also want to ask this just because I Know a lot of our listeners feel this way at all can only tell you I Am as well like I'm I Am one of those fans that holds\nOffer more teams being in there at the end of the year whether it'd be eight whether it be like what used to be called one double a in has sixteen or anything like that\nWhen a fair to ask you that what are the chances of that sometime soon what's your answer\n[noise] when we created the play off we evaluated a whole spectrum of different options including [noise] go back to the way the football used to be whether it was had a chance for number one or two to make all the way over to sixteen team tournament\nAnd we settled on for because we wanted a brac with one of the playoffs the one of the bracket but we didn't want to take away from the regular season we have the most compelling and the most meaningful regular season in sports\nAnd none of us want to do anything to take away from that I read an article last week and said a bigger playoff would change the culture of college football I I happen to believe that ... and I know the president and the commissioners did when they when they set up the playoff and when they set it up\nFor twelve years of course we have eight more years to go on this agreement and I'll add one more thing I think in in the year twenty twenty three ... uh it'll come it'll be time to think about the future\nBut until then our our our leadership groups are quite happy with what we have and I say let's all just sit back and enjoy this\nGreat for came events that we have\nYeah yeah I Know that's interesting that that are twenty twenty three is the time that that you know you might reevaluate are or who knows what will happen but I also I ... I I don't know I I Wonder about this though from from from this perspective I mean did you look at other sports even for instance the NFL um you know\n... you say it might less than the regular season I I Wonder about the idea of ever having a way to finish the season where guys like you wouldn't have to necessarily sit in a in a board room somewhere and decide who's going to go where in other words is there ever a way where college football\nSimply sends people to a playoff based solely on whether they wanna division or a conference similar to the way other sports operate\nYou know blows whoa whoa\nWhoa ing champion will emerge on Fox Sports radio\nIndeed knows it's hard to find qualified candidates when you're hiring like finding a unicorn boy you post your job on indeed it's easy to find people with skills you need a\nNurse practitioner for plus years experience acute care certification indeed have the huge pool of amazing candidate\nAnd screen or tools that help you find your most qualified applicants and in the Irish shortlist of unicorn even more than three million companies worldwide you didn't need to hire post your job and indeed dot com slash higher indeed the world's number one job site source Concord and discover\nWe believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation\nThat's why we think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving us a try we're going to get new card members a one year anniversary gift they'll never forget\nAt the end of your first year will match all the cash back you earned dollar for dollar no cap and they'll catch is because we know if you try us you'll like it and that's worth every penny try it and believe it at discovered dot com slash match cash back match up or only for a new car members limitations apply\nOkay to Europe than twelve thirty in Ninety three point three FM forecast for northwest Minnesota\nFor tonight expecting mostly ... guys with low temperatures dip into around thirty degrees lumber wins out of the north and nor the then for your Sunday holding on to cloud cover but still looking to stay dry there with ties approaching the middle part of their forties\nThen for your Sunday night rain becoming likely could even make systems know showers late in the night with most in the mid thirties for Monday any rain snow makes changing over to rain mid forties and said that chance for rain into your Monday Night til though around thirty five\nTuesday slight chance for a shower they're up to a high forty six for Tuesday night rank and makes us some snow showers lows dropping into the mid thirties and into your Wednesday rain snow mixture early in the day changing back over to rein in science warm up to forty fallen\nInto your Thursday and next year Brennan snows in the cooler signed up for thirty in the year ... forty three for ... twelve thirty in Ninety three point three fmri and Michael camera\nMight run his route in a way to get somebody else open it up like that [noise] we need to get a Baker made you're talking about Oklahoma and Cleveland and [noise]\nIt's done children [noise] thing that we would do to do even those little things [noise] 'cause you're a rookie quarterback his second start and he's saying it's stuff like that we need to get ... [noise]\nThat's a shot at you Jack [noise] he's head coach Hugh Jackson is in year three in Cleveland and you're telling me he doesn't have people doing the little things doing the things they're supposed to do [noise] Baker Mayfield is staying with [noise] with ground aren't really going to stay [noise]\nNot good that's an indictment of his head coach\nYou can podcast all of our shows like searching Fox Sports radio when you're twenty four seven sports entertainment that we are Fox Sports radio [noise]\nFriend Mike\nYankees beat the eight seven to ... try to do it tonight by going with a full time gave tried to bullpen bullpen it is a thing called painting is the thing is like clubbing for hiking bold than it is a thing or swinging\nIt's a thing now where teams are going to try and the play offs to instead of starting a traditional starting pitcher if they don't have good enough starting pitchers were going to do with bullpen narrative fuel momentum ... guys coming in to pitch\nThe majority of the ... I mean I might be strange at first but\nEventually it's a lifestyle the gains accepted and and I know many people are down on gold panning and why are you having bullpen pictures come in and teach the first couple of these well not every team has two or three really did start as Lindsey that Jesus man with white Carmine yes the last man standing\n... pm eastern damp boxes horse race\nBetween the odd couple [noise]\nMy point is this here's my\nPoint Chris Broussard Enron Parker Iran if he were to go somewhere else other than the Lakers regulations you go to ...

you can get block here are the areas are guy\nAs I Walk I Do not block people for disagreements no you're not block disagreement what what what are you good luck where do you have to do to get locked\nHate speech okay it was one that makes them um if there's any sir I once had a someone on social media that was kind of stalking\nRight yeah like I'm here at the game you're the game and I changed his profile to me and my doing\nRight yeah like I'm here at the game you're at the game and I changed his profile to me and like doing all the fake stuff\nOkay so that that is to battle do it just a little weird and we're finding out today we're we're moving down the road of if you talk about my kids in a certain sort of a way a and I never do it right away I was given warning I'm like an NBA rough when they lift the hand\nOr they look at you like well I'm not see you [laughter] it's out of ... you want to keep talking about that you'd rather get to eat out so I'll never just block I'll always give them a hay or are you fixing to get blocked\n[laughter] that we can do that if you want I Do not mind like we are here in the fun house you here for\nMore here in the fun house we're talking about sports everything's gonna be fine at the end of the day and uh we do it how we do it we share our perspective a we have to do it in a way that sometimes sounds a little bit forward\nBecause that's like if I sat here and spoke like librarian I don't think that this would work very well\nSo that's what we do and if you want to disagree with any of that if you want to have fun with that if you want to have fun at my expense over that that is all a thousand percent fair game mhm you want to start talking about my kids and they start talking about the kids were not going there and the cat [laughter]\nWe're not doing that no so um there's a way\nTo be uh can I say\nClassy ... yet forward I don't want to use the word aggressive but if you wanted an assertive yeah there was a good word if you want to be assertive you can do that with class and then there's a way to be assertive without class\nSo sorry I had to I had to finish [laughter] at the finish um\nWe're getting close we're getting close but the ... hotel we'll find out we'll find out what it was a loose [laughter] a marker underscore to underscore whether it if you'd like to join in on the sun or that's what we're doing here it's fine and great news quick way to save somebody switch to a guy go get a guy could I comment and fifty minutes could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance\nUm here's something speaking of my kids I I like to try to teach this around the house so ah for instance I have a daughter who's really good soccer player\nAnd uh she's the one that prevents you from going to the games uh ... yeah I I mean I missed one of my daughter's soccer games 'cause those are show man\nThat is a show is a show going on that's right\nThe beautiful game with a beautiful

half time now [noise]\nRams are freebie back into this game as they are now trailing the Green Bay Packers tend to have [noise] you'll get the stats and the first half years Iran started slow but they're picking up some momentum and actually eat from this has been sort of the rams Hamel all season long they've had a number\nAgain so they'd gotten up to a little bit of a slow start they sort of feel out their opponent and then they all ... in Wyoming oh wham o is\nRight or by well earlier today we had a remarkable game\nTruly remarkable game as it looked like it was going to be blowout city the Bengals are blowing out the Tampa Bay buccaneers until Tampa benched James Winston and brought fits magic into the game during his right now they're all moose Johnson he was ever Chris Myers and Laura I'm getting a\n... and ... and ... this was an amazing game I guess everyone after the team even those Cincinnati ultimately won this game\nEveryone's talking about the situation with the buccaneers where does Tampa go next now that fitzpatrick did what he did today\n[noise] ah I really think you have to stay with Ryan um you know James continues to talk about the importance of not throwing the football over a buddy continues to do it and then there was one statement last week that that I found a particularly interesting um during her prep was even with the\nThe two interceptions in the ... and and being minus three he he felt he made the plays necessary to get a when\nI'm you know he made the Big Roads the Sean Jackson or after taking a stack 'em that was ill advised a and there was actually sack again\nOr they were able to complete a big play to give Chandler cotton zero the opportunity for the fifty nine your field goal and and he walked away from that in my opinion\nNot feeling as though he had dodged the bullet but that he was integral a in and winning that game and and he was made to throw but he also put his seeming a tough position so again today a you know I think\nWhat we saw today was all for those interceptions are probably on gene this last week or more to the interceptions was because one of his receivers that on the wall routed brought a defender\nOr that he did not anticipate to be there but I I think today there was a couple of overthrows\nUm he just he did not quite well from the quarterback position he did not see the field well um so I I really think the Tampa Bay has no option right now but but to go with Ryan ...\nMost you know this as a player or coaches hate when you continue to make the same state right or if you're a young player you're young quarterback or any position a you make mistakes okay but in your fourth season as a quarterback\nYou cannot the narrative can't be the same we can still be\nTurning the ball over especially in the red zone but you you can't it can't happen no matter how much talent you have no matter how much on strings or whatever that is if you continually turning the ball over especially in the red zone in scoring position they can't you can't work with it\nNo no and and and that's the biggest thing because this is you know they're doing great offensively they're throwing up all kinds of yards and doing different things\nUm you know for my explosive standpoint but as you pointed out you know when you start to lose points and then let's let's just say today that it was it was definitely the first few local uh uh the first interception costs and if you go what's happened the second one probably cost them some points there and then obviously the pitch six so\nUm yeah you're you're just you're mistakes are are are very critical so um it's this is the sixteenth game he's had a multi interception game I I think I saw a graphic on our telecast they once he got the four I think it was the third time and his group that he's had four interceptions\nCrazy so you know that that's just that's irresponsible and as you pointed out making the same mistake and not learning from your errors in the in the in the past\nThere always Johnson is joining us right now is a nice bounce back when for the bangles even if it got a little shaky at the end show mix in a is an emerging star all the controversy involving these young man coming into the NFL\nToday is first hundred yard day of the season ... what are you seeing Joe mixing how good can he be\n[noise] how he can be very good uh I think I think he gives the complimentary element to Cincinnati is all fence um you know I marked off the defensive coordinator for the box was was concerned about John makes another one game um and and he proved why this afternoon so it was one of the points that that more of an\nReally emphasize with us or friday when we sat down and talk to the Bengals players and coaches are ... and he wanted he wanted anti ... and in some of the run past option opportunities or if it's a fifty fifty it's not a it's just a real\nYou know heavy past situation let's let's let's go with the ... let's let's try to get a physical element back into our our pets and and they kind of went that way today I think you saw\nOn a on the opening drives or Cincinnati that uh they were they were really starting to see Joe mixing the ball so um you know I I think he earns an opportunity to to become a bigger part of it I thought he ran well I'm ... there were several times when there wasn't a lot there are any and he was getting yards\nAre on his own so yeah I I think that that it's something today that they really need to take a long hard look at it become a little bit more balanced moving forward\nAnd we talk about aging green and we are I'm In the office of weapons to Cincinnati has the surprise for me and I've been for a lot of people it's not so much AJ green we know what he brings me to say what the emergence of Tyler Boyd\nAre really being a a one a receiver for Cincinnati just talk about the importance of him or to a recipe for these big play for ... to target\nYeah without a doubt um you know you kind of disappeared and that Kansas City game last week and\nUm but he's had a couple of big games or and so far this year I had another one this afternoon or you have to have that complimentary guy when when when the fences all of a sudden they have their plan to take away AJ green and the players to it you've got to have somebody else it's there to be able to take advantage of that and\nYou know ... was that guy in the middle of the fuel from the tide in position and now it's titled Boyd\nOr you know I I think that Alex Erickson as the guy that or is she is in progress as before and we used to use them or is that slot type receiver and and some of the jet sweeps and different things that they used with his skill set so as Cincinnati transitions out of that three tied in personnel grouping that\nThere was so successful form in the beginning of the year because they've had so many injury is hiding spot you're going to see this pretty wide receiver group start to become more comfortable and start to become a big part of what they're doing all kinds of\n... so the Bengals are five and three moves right now halfway through the season they had a plus for internal margins today but they gave up five hundred and Seventy six told a yard so the bucks so I guess Bengal fans want to know should they be taken seriously as a contender or are they still pretender\nUm the the [noise] you know the the big thing for me is um you know you look at what they're doing right now and there seems to be um an adjustment going on with\nAnd there seems to be um an adjustment going on with her last coming in and trying to wanting to put his spin on what they're doing a defensively um you know this is very similar to what Minnesota does it it's kind of that Mike Zimmer style the fence that they've\nThey've still really kind of leaned on\nA ... like the kind of tweak it a little bit I think that they were waiting for the by week he's been trying to add bits and pieces\nUm so I think we need to see what happens after the ... uh they've got good players in place or their linebacker position has been hit hard by injury or but they've got a good front they've got a good rotation or I think there are secondary\nUm is more than capable that they should not be a team that allows people to get behind them a critical points in the game it's a seat the shock jocks without a double moved to see my evidence or at that stage of the game be able to get five yards beyond your safety\nHarvard and he's from so long\nI wasn't expecting to talk to this man for another week especially after\nWhat happened yesterday Florida Gators had a big battle against Georgia down there in Jacksonville it did not end well joining us once again from serious XM NFL radio the one and only\nAlex Marvin as Alex your hopes are high for your gators yesterday but Georgia proved to be a a little too strong\nYes you would be correct about that strong like all the drinks but I also resent\nThat they call it the world's largest outdoor cocktail party I Will tell you that it really is an unbelievable incredibly passionate feeding a you know in Jacksonville every year for Florida Georgia in Georgia the better team and\nI think with a knife or for Ford is you have a little bit of a litmus test to you know with George or being superior opponent we now know where we're at it seems like the SEC east as a pipe dream for the skaters team but you know you just chalk it up hope you rebound next week against Missouri go at it again but Georgia was the better team do question\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what's going on today are a lot of things and the biggest story is what happened in Tampa where James went and got bench after throwing for interceptions and look back Ryan Fitzpatrick Internet a remarkable comeback the Bengals did ultimately prevail\nQuestion moving forward is what is Tampa Bay going to do at the quarterback position your production Alex\nMy production is Ryan Fitzpatrick now the question is who is making\nThis decision I Would assume it's going to be dark cutter who is making this decision but you know when you when you think about Jason light the general manager you know he is tethered his uh\nHis boat to the gym is Winston doc so to speak right I mean he's the one that picked him at twenty Fifteen with a number one overall pick he's continued to stand by James Winston er during all of his off field difficulties have resulted in the three game suspension earlier this year but how telling you is it\nThe Tampa Bay players when voting for their team captain did not vote\nSeamus Winston a captain I mean this is your quarterback right and and his teammates did not vote him a captain they didn't know drove in Korea captain either by the way to pick me tell you a little something there as well about the two highest paid players in the franchise I think outside of my cap and so\nI think it's Ryan pits Patrick you know and at some point you have to ask yourself to if something were to happen to James Winston let's say a torn ACL I hate to think like this but I'm just saying if he were to get injured playing quarterback for you right now and you're not committed to him\nBeyond the season you are running that are that risk much like what Jason for red in the LA Chargers that you're going to have damaged goods on a player and you're going to be forced to pick up the fifth year option in their contract that would be about twenty million dollars in salary for James Winston\nI'm just really not sure where James says when I was just a terrible game for interceptions wasn't like they were tipped passes or things that you know we're ... these are just bad decisions and it just seems like the deep passing game is better life it's Patrick is under center\nHe's done he can't you can't hit your wagging to the gym is Winston anymore in my opinion a given his inability to not turn the ball over in a row down the the things that he's been working for the past three and a half years he still doing those things\nAnd on top of that is also the bill ... ended in maturity you cannot pick is if you're out you know and we were discussing so what do they do about a quarter back in the future the matter what they decided to do it can't be with him and my right in that situation\nI Believe you are and but the question that is what are we doing here is the head coaches a general manager where we act with this box franchise right now\nI mean drink some light is done some good things look at the office of talent that he's assemble through both free agency or you know and also the draft I mean there were some really talented players on the squad that's why they traded to Sean Jackson it would hurt the fence and obviously the rumors flying about that but of course God when I was a guy it'd be starting on those teams you know as one of the top two receivers and instead he's the number three\nIn Tampa so you know and he might be ready to move up and start making some big plays himself but I think that's the thing that gets tricky plus the bugs are too good in this regard you figure their team that's going to win six seven games this season maybe\nFive hundred but probably around that level that's not going to put you in great position and the draft unnecessarily get someone so you might have to give up ... to try to move up I'm not sure what the free agent answer is we have some guys like make fools who's going to be out there but does that really the long term I mean the falls is what Ryan Fitzpatrick without a beard I mean\nThe long term I mean the polls is what Ryan Fitzpatrick without a beard I mean so right yeah ... you know what I mean so it's just it's a curious time right now for this book's organization but I'm with you James Swanson has done nothing to show that that you want to pick up that fifth eruption pay him that amount of money\nUnless he's to turn around a season we he's got a lot but then the question is is if he's not starting next week Wednesday starting again in Tampa\nAlex ... Jay Z what obviously guinea a lot of acknowledgement is comeback player of the year and and rightfully so he might be defensive player of the year again but let's talk about the comeback Adrian Peterson a while I mean I'm thirty three year old running\nBack when they when he's dominant it's been very simple I mean look at the numbers I mean every game the day when he get Ninety plus he had a hundred and four hundred and forty nine yards rushing today\nA John Regan's revisited hum but try to put in perspective Adrian Peterson come back and what it means for this red skins team\nYou know it's funny you mentioned ... because I Believe it's ... and John Henry Johnson only running backs in NFL history over the age of thirty three that have rush for as many yards in one game as Adrian Peterson just it ... for Washington today against that hapless New York giants defense you know maybe if they had snacks Harris oh wait they traded\n[laughter] to point\nOut and how about that you trade your best run stuff guy and all of a sudden you get gassed by this Redskins team but you're right about Adrian listen to them I was you know I raised my hand as someone that had really counted amount of took the NFL I mean think about it right in Adrian Peterson wouldn't be on this team if various guys hadn't gotten injured\nDuring the pre season he was supposed to be the bell curve running back Adrian might be somewhere else but\nWhich you've got an Jake route and two things your number one he's trusting in Adrian Peterson running the ball\nJ. when you look at the analytics he's one of these guys that cause more first down runs just about anybody in the NFL so he's allowing Adrian Peterson to try to grind it out on those down so he's getting opportunities because that's the type of back Adrian as he's not a ten carried type of guy to be truly effective you know he's got to be a little bit more than that so\nYou look at that and also using them as a pass receiver and now these are complicated routes that he's asking Adrian to run and he's not putting them out wide or anything like that but what he's doing is he's available on the screen game is a check down for Alex Smith and then boom\nGood things are starting to happen one other thing we should mention about the Redskins as well they're run defense has gotten so much better I mean and you know you look at the Alabama connection that you know drawn paying Jonathan Allen those guys have stepped up I just think that this Redskins defense much improved as well it's giving them all to try to win this division although again is hoping Philadelphia at the end of the day is going to take it\nA year and just talking about Adrian Peterson I never counted him out because I realized you had a couple years where he was an active uh due to offer to build things and then rehabbing from injury\nSo he doesn't have the normal wear and tear you would have on a running back at thirty three and I know thirty three and ... is running back in any capacity now it's like oh taboo\nBut the fact that he still has something to prove not only to themselves but to the league\nAnd you know you put them on a team that loses their number one guy and you bring him in I mean he's playing with house money right now he doesn't have anything to lose a step you know helping these teams are Redskin team who led by another veteran in Alex Smith\nReally holding the locker room together and galvanizes team moving forward\nI'm so glad you mentioned that because I thought to Chris Thompson the Redskins running back about this and he was saying that\nAdrian lights up the room is it was just such a joy when he first got there because he's\nA funny guy he's a fun loving guy and listen everyone knows oh my gosh we're playing with Adrian Peterson right I mean you're you're talking when Adrian was in the league this was two thousand seven right so let's put this in perspective he was drafted in two thousand seven some of the youngest players on this Redskins team or run the eleven years old\nWhen they made it into the NFL and it's like you get to play with a living legend\nIn Adrian Peterson owned by the way physically he is back to where he he no he looked good I mean it was in the long run that he had today and they you know that he scored on\nI mean he was getting calls from behind that would have happened to the old Adrian Peterson but it was late in the game but man oh man I mean he just he works out so hard and he's so committed to that in fact he told me I talked about this\nBack in the pre season or that he had taken up rats\nOne not not wrestling like pro wrestling but ... you know like he was doing that type of work I think he also did some boxing or this off season just trying to mix it up on top of the herculean type lips that he does\nYou know all the time I mean the guy is it in a lot of ways it's like ... Walker in that regard ... just the physical free who's taken care of themselves physically to be able to reach the heights that he has\nAnd speaking of legends Adam ... Terry passing Martin Andersen today is the all time leading scorer in the history of the national football league or you're a member of the hall of fame too many I mean obviously is going to be a hall of famer but\nHave the we have we come to grass you know with the idea of the special is not just kick hers partners you know how you'd try to put a their careers in perspective with other football players how do you approach that\nBy the way I don't know if you realize this but ... actually kicked off to Herschel Walker\nNineteen now back in\nNineteen Ninety six and he made the tackle on the play is Herschel was running down the field so think about putting that in perspective there for Adam vegetarian listen I don't think there was a punter that's going to gain a lot of traction going going ahead I think right guys going to be that person for a long period of time no offense to shame Locklear I just don't see the momentum\nAt least right away for a ... I don't think it's a matter of him getting in the hall of fame I think it's a matter of the first ballot\nRe Mel Luna is the proper pronunciation now this blows me away or you went to ...\nYear there are people who have been missed ... pronouncing my name is head coach of calling me from our bureau hey nice to meet them ... hey I'm from I'm like okay\nThat was lifted a second but I Do go out there I saw Thirteen Years only how many people are still calling you from ... yeah all the time I I just ignored it just try to correct you don't have I have [laughter] I'm like ah\nWhatever well my attitude about a ... by law is it'd be washed away with a Heisman Trophy which I Would imagine he's going to consider he had talked about the record is twenty five touchdown\nPasses zero picks so far this year and get this he may become the first Heisman winner who never actually plays in the fourth quarter of a\nGame you know you had to take a ride angles ear and out in the fourth\nQuarter all season long\nHave you seen them plenty of these that good or it's just\nI thought he was a good when he came in in the national championship through that pat I I thought he was good I Would like all this kid had this might be the first Alabama quarterback biggest drafted did actually is an NFL quarterbacks I mean when you consider the best quarterback the Knicks savings had has been AJ McCarron\nYeah yeah ... by law is better she'll get used to it it just sort of like a by the way markers\nMario that not marry at a mall or a Yoda\nHad him on the show he said my name is ... ... it's mark is more Rio de\n...

even there it wasn't again for the most part here's the thing there are there there are a number of people that I've talked to throughout the week that want to know what's going on I before for well I mean when you talk about the details ...\nThe fact is the raiders have three first year players on or off it's why you do it's gonna you're gonna have to if you're John Gurdon us off and you're going to have to get creative you're gonna have to move the ... you're going to do things differently because you cannot\nStand bacteria and expect protection to hold up they they ended up one match protection what your seven protection which means you're only basically had two to three guys out routes\nSeattle just played zone they bracket at the top receivers and they are they played everything else like everything else underneath you're not going to live on like that\nNow you know you know you can't ... and ... and that's a huge problem with them\nThe problem is is that they can't protect
