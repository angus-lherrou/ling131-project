M. A. okay\nHabib ... okay wow I'll say it again okay who ... ... dollars All right close to ... million baseball\nThe most disgusting charade of any sporting event I've ever witnessed it puts the W. W. E. Y. shame and I'll tell you something else I\nI don't go here as if the actual fight wasn't big enough the real story is what happened afterwards in which all hell broke loose and Las Vegas take a listen tennis match\n[laughter] [noise] well\n\nAll hell did break loose last night I tell you what it is a scam it's a shame it's a fake it's a phony into its you know they do for PR maybe look and they should have known and you know this they should have known this was going to happen\nIf this was bad blood between the two that was building since last April on kind of McGregor with all the way from Ireland to confront could be doing that media day the Barkley said when he girl that Dolly from the bus and it was on a pastor on the bus it ... it was ugly is just you you don't want to see stuff like that in the world of sports\nI I just don't see it the same way I Am and I get it from us these point of view the commentators immediately were like this is not professional this is not the image that we want to portray I get all that because they don't want that to be a common theme\nAnd other fights going forward but just as a fan just to sit on the couch\nThat was entertaining [laughter] the fight and next thing we know\nKobe ... airborne over the octagon wall diving after a guy one of his uh members of the crew complete cheap shot jumped over the wall in hits Carter McGregor in the back of the head total punk move\nIt but I'll tell you what Andy you can say it's disgusting and you can say it's the worst ever which I Would disagree with in terms the ladder statement this the fight game we seem crazy stuff left and right but just pure entertainment value I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't entertained by us\nWell I'm going to go one step further you know what I'm going to meet you halfway in that square circle right now we do but at the payment I'll give you an example ... let's go back to the Yankee game against the athletics the other night when the Yankees won in some clown was wearing an athletic shirts and hats\nAnd the stadium in New York City\nAnd he got drenched would be a yeah I watched on TV I left there was at the painting was disgusting yes what I Want to be there no ... but there were certain things that I could laugh that but it was a clown move it was a stupid move was disgusting move just like the thing last night at the UFC it doesn't do any good for the U. F. C. sports it does not do any good whatsoever\nI disagree also like to think that this does no good whatsoever when we're leading off our show with it [laughter] this is the fight game this isn't like\nYou know a try out for the convent you know this isn't like that this is the U.S the crazy stuff happen it's just hilarious to me how some people could look at the economy McGregor throwing water bottles and an opponent in a press conference setting\nAnd look at that and be like oh man that was awesome and then turn around and get on their high horse fish which could be just flat out costing an out rages that I just since the showerheads are flapping up and down it's like if it's leading offers show which not all bad for the site ... things ...\nShows and and this is a very similar to news cast as well anything that's out of the ordinary usually takes priority and this was certainly out of the ordinary yeah we could talk about the college football games and we will we could talk about the NFL and we will but it's certainly just like a newscast that's on local news if you have eight houses\nIn a subdivision and the one house is burning that's the house is going to lead on the news there is something that's unusual and this was very very unusual\nYeah right and it's being talked about and it's being focused on\nAnd that's not all bad for us to see if you think that last night won't help sell the next fight we get a rematch between ... you're crazy so to sit here and say there's no good that can come from that spectacle and that's disgusting display and it's not true\nYou know what they will sell tickets they wouldn't have a rematch it'll happen again I'm not surprised that happened but you know what it it it just staying on the sports to me I'm not approved you know\nI I thought was there I I'd say wow I brag about that I yeah I was there in ... saw an ad right but I look at it for you yeah you would do is I I was there that one and you and I'll

reports\nWere premature we'll get to that are just doing it but that's when he finished the hourly coldest day he's Brian no different than what brought you might discover card we treat you like you treat you now here's the stage for my partner my partner Brian notes from the great state of Indiana a big Notre Dame fan\nOf going to put the spotlight on them right now\nI watch the game last night halftime you know if you know did they offend you kind of biting your nails little bits Seventeen sixteen that they have over no today but I watched that defense I mean really interest mothering I've never seen deepest like that and use I really habits they go on to win they beat biotech and Blacksburg last night by score a forty five\nTwenty three tell me your opinion of that game but that's I think the Irish right now will not have a dent in their schedule the rest of the way\nWell I mean look nice when last night and you think about last week's game against Stanford\nThat was the first top ten game at Notre Dame stadium since the Bush pushed game Thirteen Years ago that amazing yeah so the beat Stanford\nAnd all of a sudden at Stanford when looks a little less impressive because you think about stand for getting gifted again by Oregon and then getting blown up by Utah last night\nBut that was a big win for Notre Dame and to come off of that emotional big win at home go on the road you're only up Seventeen to sixteen at half time a lot of emotion in that building and they play very well in the second half so yeah I'm impressed by the defense and also Dexter Williams the very running back\nI didn't like in book last night he was inaccurate far too many times so that all things considered when you both raised some like that when you didn't play your best foot ball it's positive signs for the future\nDoubt about that I'll give you the positive side of the sort of the move away from the Irish because you've got to keep on global talking about that because it made me sick so they they want and you're happy and you got your time and this and that's it well I Do but you know I Know because it's like\nAnd this and that's it I have rarely are good but you know I Know because it's like with the stuff you know I I got I really do but now we showed the patriots now forget about the patriots obituaries for now because I forgot the other day\nThirty eight twenty four Brady reach five hundred ... touchdowns by the way it's funny because they'll always remember he passed that five hundred suggest scored and our eyes\nAnd maybe we could close the argument pay versus Brady that's all I've heard for years and they've always said whoa hey I had the stats Brady had the titles I'll tell you right now here and now we're going to close the story here Brady has both\nBernie as both right now so there there's no more argument would Peyton than Brady Brady Scott I'm both he's demand period and the story\nOf that argument was settled for anybody with half a brain a long time ago I had a Tom Brady it's not even close Peyton Manning how many times that he just absolutely wet himself in big playoff moment no doubt ton at times man for\nInterceptions against the patriots in the playoffs the big picture six can you imagine Andy for a second can you imagine if Tom Brady threw up six to lose a Super Bowl how people wouldn't come close to gloss over it if they do and Peyton Manning because they like him\nBut it's not even close in terms of who's had a better postseason resume and who's the better individual quarterback Tom Brady by a mile\nRight I couldn't agree more ... and we'll leave it at that and the patriots it back in the demise of the patriots is or was too soon although I I tell you I understand that because most people want to see them lose you know that's just the right way life right don't you agree\nI mean yeah ... but that day I Would think yeah right but you've got it still be reasonable there isn't another team right now Andy or people are emotionally emotionally idiotic about\nThat even close to the same level as the patriots think about that for a scientist sport in any any sport anything that you want to poll the warriors in basketball you know we can root for them to lose I Do you do you don't like Katie joining a Seventy three when team but we're not unreasonable\nOr not like oh yeah they're going to get tripped up by the grid leads this year as long as connelly's healthy or not tell them when it comes to them and the patriots have not seen that before\nThey stumble out of the gate they don't play great in September they play a lot of young guys and try to figure it out and what do you know they always do so it was doom and gloom and they were one and two and then off at two games\nIn a you know short span of time of a sudden they're healthier at three into and it looks much different with Julian Edelman back in with Josh Gordon contributing\nTo tell you one thing that's not that healthy the Pittsburgh Steelers I don't know what's going on there and I think there's rumors in Pittsburgh that they basically want their head coach Mike Tomlin gone they said he's lost a locked room Steelers are home today one two and wants to record the fate of factors who are not much better than one in three five goes off to the bangles that's all I'm going to say about that at Cincinnati so we move on Steelers ...\nFive hundred Andy you're allowed to talk of angles you know\nSteel is left at home to Baltimore and right now I forgot to look and see that's how did I get them out a way because I'm not aligned guy but you are so we'd go there but I Will tell you right now fountains are probably win this game I really believe stop let's take them today\nThey might I mean this is one of the handful of big games featuring teams with horrible records right because\nYou had a Dan Quinn earlier this week falcons head coach say he believed that the falcons are better than the record indicates and I agree with him you go back to the old school bill parcell blind you are what your records that you are they are one in three football team right now\nBut going forward there a higher caliber then that Andy I Would look at it like the dolphins were three you know and they got ... by the one into patriots at the time so your record doesn't tell the full story going forward every single time\nAnd so many injuries with the falcons defense that the Achilles heel for them so I expect this to be a shoot out I think it's going to be a really high scoring game but for the falcons to drop to one in four or the Steelers to drop to one three in one after losing a home game that's what would happen if they lose to the falcons today\nAnd you're in a hole you can't afford to lose this game of you're either a team\nAnd what led the really has to do just gets ... really really Jones involve more the ... really right now is the first NFL in history which just touched down to the team's first four games and ... Jones hundred Seventy three receiving a it's been in the first player ever\nWith forty one won a hundred yard games in his first Ninety nine games will get those guys involved that's your strength that's basically a straight get them involved and that's\nAll they have to do they just got to get defenders involved in defending that their issue these events that's the problem they've scored in the high thirties the last couple of weeks in Las ... games you know so I mentioned that yeah I I was really real quickly though if you look at the Steelers\nBig ban has been exposed this year without levy on ... back there they've only average two point eight yards per rushed the last three weeks that's what you've seen from the Steelers and last Sunday night\nBut what Andy Reid has been able to do just schemes certain match ups would they can take advantage I wanted to see just magically what Andy Reid comes up with against the jaguars defense because if you're getting pressure consistently and Patrick Murray homes\nThat absolutely it takes a lot away from us to play color with Andy Reid\nAnd I want to see just in terms of you know the J Lynne Ramsay ... I Love the trash talk back and forth with jailing Ramsey saying he's they returned specialists let's get that straight a return special if\nThere's a big game for ... hill because if he's quiet and this one a lot of people are going to look at jailing Ramsey and say yeah it he just returned guy when when he's not but it's going to be an overreaction of type ... doesn't play well today\nYou know here's the question I mean I don't know how you feel about this but I'm shocked that the Kansas City chiefs have gotten off of the stuff that they have and what touchable homes is done and I often wonder and I haven't seen a lot of reports about this that a good story line would be would they be as successful if Alex Smith was still under center\nWould they be because now we have the parts offensively to do well maybe not as well but still little is it all Patrick my home so I mean it's a lot to do with them for sure\nAbsolutely it is they wouldn't you know be averaging seven points a game cube had Alex Smith he had the highest past rating in football that yes yeah so they would be successful offensively\nBut when you look weak in week out thirty eight points forty two thirty eight twenty seven when I get off week on the road Monday Night football in Denver\nI don't think they'd be going to this degree I don't think that Alex Smith\nWould be pushing the ball down the field where you would have fourteen touchdown passes zero interceptions so yeah Patrick ... homes numbers I think are a bit healthier than what you would have seen from Alex Smith in the same often but you got a lot of weapons over there but I think it is that just medically against\nThe forty niners you had a great throw where Patrick ... bought time uses athleticism he rolled out to his right through a touchdown pass those are some of the plays that he's been able to make that are just special look at the left hand to throw against Denver right out the right out a lot of quarterback in the league doing that\nAnd everybody talks of ballots in Austin it's I mean here's a team that has gained something like twelve hundred yards through the air offensively and only rush for like four hundred and fifty yards I mean where's the balance there so you know all that stuff you thought of that stuff out the window because I think that Europe coach and you have to do what you have to do with the person do you have\nI mean I I watch these announces on TV's while you know are there still is today after twelve plays the situation in places just pass he plays you know it's great balance great balanced means nothing if you don't get it done if you don't get the job is to look beginning to John in Kansas City but there's no balance right\nWell yeah there's not a whole lot I mean it's definitely one sided so right as long as we're coming along it's all good but you're going to come to later in the season maybe it's raining sideways maybe it's a bad\nWeather game you know you got to be able to have more tricks in your bag to survive over the long haul and right now you got a great passing game\nYou've got no deeds and you've got a decent running game\nThat route enough balance to really be a threat\nTo do some significant damage their day is going to come do similar last year they got off the great start five and no and I think you know they're losing six of seven because when they get older they'll send it up yeah he won't be able to catch up they could lose three of four they could have a similar stretch here not too far from now\nNo doubt about that Brian firmly alive

playing to pick up game of tackle football wasn't practicing finishing wrestling moves nothing so I've got this left shoulder issue I had a couple of surgeries on it back in the day from playing sports whatever\nSo I went in to get that checked out and in the meantime I was like hey can you take a look at this calf muscle here yeah hold that\nYou know I have an idea because this is what I Would do if I had the calf problem I Would do the sympathy game I'd go to a store and buy a cane and go to work tomorrow with a cane and it's really it's a great conversation piece of people who really feel sorry for ya something where they can't live\nTheir life ... yeah but and you got to play this out beforehand as soon as they're like what happened and you tell them the story well you know I was sitting and uh well that's it I was just sitting there going to be like you serious you gotta ... because of that I Can't go down that road\nYou wouldn't do that huh no nah by the way we do have to welcome ... because we do have another producer they're coming in life like bees like a harvest anew producer but Ryan's been there before\nSo he knows he knows the landscape of Fox football Sunday so we want to welcome Ryan with us today and hopefully enjoys this day and be a little longer than most but we'll see what happens right we'll see what happens there\n[laughter] very\nTepid introduction by you where it's like\nHey guy today\nWill and schedule next week and see what's going on but [laughter] yeah it's\nA revolving door at producer here for our ... and we've always said and that's fine because they're moving around you know sometimes they stay in house sometimes they move\nOn what have you but I'm Ryan if he doesn't have the if the rotational door kind of applies to him we know that the with the pipes that he's going to have a high profile gig you know he's going to do high profile voiceover work maybe movie\nTrailers could be the next hosted the prices right something like that then Alice sort of that ... that goes into younger Andy no doubt that ... that's right that's what I wanted to you with us into that right\nI Love you know the one thing that you know about me Mr know is the fact that I Know a little about a lot\nWhich means like I'm not that smart but I just have enough to get by on a lot of different topics and I know that this week is Halloween so I wanted like give it a little educational background of like the history of Halloween because I I Know you'll be trick or treating with your lovely wife right is that correct you because of some sort of a party wearing the cost of ... am I right or wrong\nI you know I'm definitely going to wear a costume I was thinking about going into a giant piece of candy corn if I could track that down and that's what I Want to go as because there's some people the Portland weekday show I Do they give me a lot of\nOf grief because I Am a big fan of candy corn how can you look down on candy corn I ask you Randy from and how\nYou know you only see that candy once a year and Halloween yeah other than that you can never find it and that's a good idea yeah\nThere are no fan of it I don't\nSee a whole lot of turkey during the year but I go all in on turkey had Thanksgiving well you know you don't have the eating all year round for it to be delicious right\nSo that's good candy corn that I Love that you know ah I I looked it up was I'm always curious like you know how to start Halloween or just stay back to the agent killed the festival of sewing and the day marked the end of summer\nAnd the harvest and the beginning of the dark cold winter time with the there was often associated with human death\nAnd the ... I Believe that the night before the new year which was November the first the boundary between the world to the living in the day became word on the night of October the thirty first they celebrated sewing whether it's believed get this at the ghosts of the dead return to earth\nJust a little information was always wanted to know when did it start what's at all about you know so uh if if I may\nAgain a little bit about a lot of different things\nI'm ... I'm curious what the most obscure thing that you've wondered about that have checked into you know Mr know a little about a lot what's the one thing where you're like I Wonder how that came to be and it's the most obscure story what would that be off the\nTie your head and wonder who was the originator of ZIP codes because I used to do a lot of money [laughter] actually I slept and I wonder like why did they start like on the east moved to the west because the ones and zeroes on the northeast and the nines usually are on the west coast\nRight the a drop out here and say oh you know area to think about is adamantly with yeah he used his things yeah yeah a little bit like\nThey our phone number eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox no or you know kind of have a\nYou know it it winds up it can work for your radio station based on the lettering that's involved right right now does that apply to area codes at all\nWhat are the area code that translate the funny words that are three letters what are the cities and states that had a tactical approach of which three numbers they would be known as you know\nWell ah where I live I area code is eight five nine which stands for and K wind northern Kentucky south of Cincinnati\nHuh Interesting right they're seeing any one yeah you do know a lot about a little\nWhich means nothing it really does have said if you're on a quiz show like jeopardy that's where it goes back to college football but that's that's what we did yesterday I Know you're happy there was no doubt and your mind I'm sure when they were playing navy but Notre Dame rolled I'm forty four twenty two and I'm sure you watched that game but just a game of the day may very well have been that Oklahoma State Texas game\nBecause Texas right now basically that knocked out of the playoff pitcher\nThey really are they're finished I mean I Can't believe I mean they've certainly beat Oklahoma earlier this year and\nThey somewhat control their own destiny to win that big twelve titled gay but that was a bad laws for Texas yesterday\nWe at pretty much take them out of contention and that hurts Oklahoma too it's not like the worst loss of all time where you go to the water you lose Oklahoma State at night but Oklahoma losing the red river rivalry\nAnd we stayed at night but Oklahoma losing the red river rivalry slash shootout slash showdown slash fill in the blank you that hurts Oklahoma because you want to Texas to run the table if you're Oklahoma\nAnd beat them in the big twelve championship game we're now you're beating at best if you face taxes the two last team that's not good but it's not good for the big twelve as a whole because it does not look like they're going to have a representative they need a whole lot of help ahead of them to sneak a team into the uh college football playoff\nYeah and it does it get an easier to Texas either was next week they play West Virginia West Virginia rolled Baylor yesterday fifty eight fourteen so again I mean I'd rather have twelve I I Do enjoy the top because they don't play any decent says ...\nThan any into your extended forecast more clouds were building the area Monday as we expect overcast conditions and sort of scattered rain showers as well with high is pretty steady around forty eight wins coming down all the southeast at five to ten\nAnd then Tuesday looks like it's going

Cooper from this point throughout the rest of the season\nAnd I think that he's certainly a first round talent had you you know ... thought about it in let in the context of next year's draft where instead of going with the keel Harry or whoever you're going within the first round you're going with Marie Cooper you certainly could make the argument that you're getting better value with the ... coup or\nYou know what you make a lot of sense but I was shocked because John crude and when he was a commentator for ESPN was hailing the move that the going rate has got Maury Cooper so\nI was kind of like shot that he would just unload the guy that that is what kind of made me crazy I mean you you love the guy when you already SPN talking about it now you're as coach you got rid of him so I don't understand that and maybe they seek help us and our number three with hotel is more of it and he knows a little bit more about this trade but if I may\nI'd like to kind of go back to Thursday night because you have fish filter the Texans forty tough when he\nFinally had to go here what can we keep talking about America Cooper on I'm kidding I'm kidding\nAbout this show watching five touchdowns Texans now won five straight to play a Denver next and his thirty four touchdown passes the ... I had a damn Marino had thirty two for the second most and in the history of the Fifteen games and to me the Sean wants is not getting the accolades that he deserves you don't even hear about the guy you know more about you really don't\nWell he got a lot of problems after that went against the dolphins the dolphins defense I don't know what happened to them they were just decrepit that night\nAnd you know dish on what the loses will fall or who's the wide receiver the speed ... out of Notre Dame he tore his ACL against the dolphins that's going to hurt him going forward but the ... I didn't hear a whole lot about the Sean watching this year Andy is\nHeading into that game he had ten touchdown seven picks\nYou know that's nothing to be like wow this guy is killing it hits that looked a lot better right now after a five touchdown performance against the lowly dolphins it leads defensively right you know Fifteen and seven looks a whole lot better than ten and seven but if you're not going to shower him with praise\nAfter getting the best of the dolphins well that's why you weren't before then because he hadn't happened right\nYou're exactly right I won't I won't hurt you anymore what your dolphins because they start out like a house on fire and they're kind of hit it but you know Ryan ... and I understand that but we're\nGoing on right now but think about every audience also think about this real quickly is if you look at Patrick ... homes\nHe's been amazing so far this year right right and some of the numbers that he's put up are comparable to what they're showing Watson was doing in a small sample size last year with those six starts so imagine if Patrick my home's got hurt and practice didn't play another game this year right\nNot rooting for this but just a hypothetical here and he starts out next season with ten touchdowns in seven interceptions he think anybody's you're showering him with the praise no\nNo way the way it does does that mean why it was in a love fest what the Shaun White and he's still trying to get back to form coming back from that torn ACL any showing signs you still incredibly talented but his numbers have taken a dip so far this year\nYou know and speaking of quarterbacks this talk about this game in about three hours in London the eagles three and four at the jet stream for him in London and the quarterback for the jazz obviously he is a problem Blake board was was benched for Cody Kessler in the last against the Texans the eagles right now have the ... best scoring defense and the league\nAnd the eagles did lose to Carolina I was shocked I don't know about you I was shocked with that and the eagles right now is giving a three as far as I'm concerned with the line today but they're not actual game now\nIt's up to an hour and a half now I did you check these on Tuesday again Andy goodness actually fell off the wagon again it was yes no no no ... and now you're off to the new and you just go through that you and the other day after the U.S that good enough energy from the day of the day job with this ... move quickly over here but I'll tell you the\nYou what I'm not really a big advocate of change because you know why I'm a stat guy and\nLike when you look at the record books it doesn't really mean anything because now you you extra points at the thirty three yard line as opposed to what it used to be like was seven to ten your job which is ridiculous so you can't do any comparisons right there but yes it does change the game the Pittsburgh Steelers and their situation they go to a lot more than they go for one\nThat's what they do right now because now ... now what do I mean if if you talk to Mike Tomlin I mean he will tell you that that is it when in doubt he'll go for the two I think that they do it it was a lot more so more so than any other team in the league\nBut it's a better product it's more exciting I liked that it isn't a sure thing it is in a way up in the NFL having to do longer extra point\nIt leads to some crazy outcomes the game I would've loved the scene over time last week but the way it ended which has to talk to her missing an extra point that was exciting it was interesting it was a huge talking point you know so I imagine after a touchdown you don't just run to the fridge and like All right this is\nYou know it's already a done deal you've got to sit there and watch it like ... there's a lot of pressure on this kick is he going to make it\nAnd junk you talked to one of the ... field goal kicker is ever misses the extra point and it just shows you it's anything but a lay up now I think about it for field goals or fifty or two more automatic medic in any capacity really it was shocking to see a myth that it it really was\nIt really what I tell you what though there's another situation that they really got to clean up the Baltimore and that's wide receiver Michael ... I I don't believe how many\nPasses he's dropped and I'm looking for ... I don't think they keep drops do they have you seen that show that I don't see that one of the\nCommon ones you know it's not one of the comedy categories you can find it but you got to do some sifting you know you got to go into back alley website and\nFind it on page nine instead of the front page you know what I mean right you got to really dig deep for that one but yeah I think that\nDrops should be one of your main stats they were you involved when you're looking at wide receivers I I don't know what happened to crab trees hand I Know you remember him at Texas Tech Andy that dude caught every thing you can't raising hands in college what happened to him in the NFL\nHe was even decent in San Francisco\nComing to Baltimore I don't know what happened to you I really don't but well it's\nBeen happening for the last couple of years I don't know if it's just the lack of concentration its lack of confidence that something's going on there maybe it's writers [laughter] you're not saying I'm just saying you know it's funny though you know when the Audrey Hopkins makes that insane catch that didn't count against the Miami Dolphins\nAnd people take way too much credit away and they're like well he's clubs I mean goodness these glove you just stick your hand out there ... it doesn't work like that the ... that catch was amazing the ... junior catch against the cowboys couple of years ago was amazing it's not just a byproduct\nOf really sticky modern glove Michael Crabtree would be a great example of that the dude wears gloves and he was dropping passes left and right\nHe may be better off not wearing gloves really is not working with the gloves I say that right now we'll see what happens today and I got an opinion downhill that he was like I Do like the ... this game and a close one who do you like and this one\n[noise] gosh I [noise]\nI'm going to go with Carolina because they held the eagles to fifty eight yards rushing last week I like the rush the fence and if you can make the ravens one dimensional I liked my chances at home against Joe Flaco even though he's had success against them in the south teams\nI I Would go with the home team getting points to your dogs are barking I hear you\nBrian no Andy forever would live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios\nAnd it's time to fight with your mouth not your fish why prompts talk radio is next [noise] around\nThe red Sox won gave away from another championship time to panic Dodger fan so you're going to blame this one I Andrew Freedman analytics when it comes to the world series\nWe've got a chart on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nMy name is Preston James I better stock options trader for twenty three years I used to be an active swing trader but that all changed once I discovered by money press weekly paycheck method these days I'm a passive trader calling in more cash well being able to sleep at night that I ever dream possible\nI'm passionate about the market and I like to keep it simple\nMy methods are changing thousands of lives and I'm confident it can change yours but let the proof do the talking by going to pay check prove dot com that's paycheck proof dot com you'll see a seven minute video revealing how my money press method grew a fifty\nFour thousand dollar couch to one hundred and Seventy four thousand unless the nine months that works out to fight point eight percent per week\nYou'll see the proof right inside my real brokerage account\nThis isn't about overnight riches but once you discovered this for yourself you can start on the same path overnight you're seven minutes away from changing everything you thought you knew about trading and investing go paycheck proof dot com that's paycheck proof dot com\n[noise] we hear early before they wait we stay\nLate steam form\nWhen they're in the latest technology [noise]\nWe take the time to train the next generation of doctors and nurses\nWe work together to make sure we have in my mind\nWe do not [laughter]\nThis is our mission [noise]\nMore than three hundred pounds working\nTogether families\nIn that way they live in the country will be there [noise]\nStand together to sort of\nWe stand strong\nUnited [noise]\nStand with us and caring for our federal [noise]\nMm I'm a firefighter ...

Seventy arch you cannot ... I don't care\nCollege pro semi pro women's football you can't win when you throw the ball Seventy three times you have to have some sort of a sense of balance and they couldn't get it they couldn't get it passed\nThe red zone they couldn't get into the hands of allergic to it is all field goals whatever it may be they couldn't score and they gave up five hundred and thirty nine yards\nWell and that's the thing is they're not trailing by for touchdowns the entire game you know I get that at the end you've got an ear it out and you're trailing by a lot of points but that wasn't the story line the whole game and when you're down even Twenty one to six if you ever running game\nThat would help balance out your bad defense keep your bad defense off the field you know\nSo they're not able to run the ball effectively and that hurts them it hurt him big time last night and it could hurt him going forward and you also have to throw out there the loss of Nick both uh\nBecause that hurts the defense big time as well as he leaves and he's getting ready for the NFL but you know what you can't pin this on him leaving because he wouldn't have been healthy enough to play in the game anyway ... and I can't imagine that it's just\nThe morale was so down because Nick both the left I think we're going into movie trailer mode if we go into that story week\nThat's all we ask you as a crutch that really is by the way I have no problem whatsoever with with those is doing\nYou know because every college coach is out for himself they using people that show up and put them out so look you know what's good for him he's hurt he could come back maybe later in the yeah maybe possibly get hurt again so stay on the sideline get the big bucks in the NFL and you'll probably be in the first five picks up the other trapped in April so good well I have no problem I've heard people\nSay that he's a he's a he hurt his team is that a team made is I ... hey Tim and look at the coaches liquid poachers do\nI get it but I see it slightly differently where\nWhy don't you go back why don't you get healthy why don't you train while at Ohio State going to be doing all of those things on your own time now so you could still do it at Ohio State and if Ohio State is out of contention for the college football playoff which they very well may be at the end of the season then you say hey I'm getting ready for the NFL\nBut why not at least give yourself a chance to come back if you're in the college football playoff and books\nSelf a chance to come back\nIf you're in the college football playoff and before he left we didn't know that they wouldn't be there right so in my line changes right now why would you pull the plug early on and say I am out of here no question that I Would have at least to stay\nThere and trained and gotten healthy and done all the things you've got to do outside of Ohio State I was just done 'em at Ohio State and if he wanted to go back and play in a couple of ball games\nOkay great I realize it's a risk\nBut we can't blow the risk out of proportion where if you get on the football field what you're doomed although a lot of examples miles Garrett was the first overall pick and he went and played in his bowl game so I don't think we can blow out of proportion just how great or how likely a big time injury is going to be that's all I'm saying\nTo keep the rest of our saying\nStand firm take fire ...\nSo not on our one year we sent to the severely ill or injured veterans who can't get the care they deserve the therapy and they need to walk again the treatment they need to talk again\nThe lifetime of day to day help\nThey need to live for independent line is\nWhen there's no more government funding or nursing homes\nSeems like the only option or everyone says\nWe won't leave one warrior behind not on our want to\nFind out how you can do your part\nThat find that will be W. dot org\nLet's talk about America not ... where we are the issues that divide how\nIncredible our country laughed right down the line to winding coastline\nWhether you come home to routed city street tree around seven\nWe the small town\nEvery line deserve to live in a coon\nGreen and deriving community\nAnd we all share and the responsibility to creep Judy reports from one over had thrown out there\nIn one block them out [noise]\nWe keep America beautiful\nThe nonprofit working with millions of people just like yeah see I'm lettering improve recycling I'm unify our community\nBecause every mindful action I'm ...\nTo you can join the the ... year off at ... dot org together we can be useful things\nBlack hey hey\nCollege sports for the past the the big Michigan America's top ... end up paying tax speak to our\nMid America done about outbreak us that you\nCall up your schools are wraps bright here\nIt's your legs for Fox horseracing\nOff by the Houston Texans looked at ... down to Miami don't\n...

I was gonna say real quick Andy is you can start to develop bad habits where instead of keeping your eyes down field as the quarterback\nYou start to look at big men who might be in your face and are about ... you and put you on your back you know so it's like look at Eli Manning right now it ... the two time Super Bowl champion and he's got bad habits of looking at the rush because\nNo one likes getting hit hard by an individual that's much bigger than them you know so that's like a two time Super Bowl champion\nWho is showing bad habits if you're a rookie good luck one that offensive line starts to get better\nGetting rid of those bad habits where you're just looking at the oncoming rush not an easy thing to do\nYou're right and you mentioned my record the authors of coordinator for the uh once off as a quite a former of the Arizona Cardinals he's been fired from three different organizations now this is what caused those head coach Steve we'll have to say about his decision which he made on McCoy on friday take a listen\nHigh informed on my record this morning that I Would be going in a different direction I Want to thank my for everything that he's done\nTo help his organization and his team or try to move forward seven weeks into the season based on what we were from a standpoint our production off as a side of the ball\nI felt the need to make a change and that's what I did and Byron left which will take over the uh play calling on officers out of the ball\n[noise] well I I ... I understand it that someone's going to be the scapegoat why can't\nThe head coach Steve will say we're not getting it done with him he's gone on getting a replacement this different direction garbage I hear that in every walk of life can they stop with a different direction because if I were to ask at\nThat news conference Steve ... hey coach what direction is it tell me last right forward back ... what kind of a statement is that going in a different direction I Would have all the time I\nYou're you're changing jobs you know you're you're going in the direction of Byron left which we are going to crush them on the way out they are going to be like let me tell you what\nIn the history of our fence of coordinators MIke McCoy is on the short list of the all time does I mean let's be honest with you if you think that Steve Wilson is going to say that now is going to say these things that we're just going to go to go in a different direction you know what that means they're switching to Byron left which done that's where they're going to be done\nI'm done or you ... you don't like that and I think it's\nWeak just said look he didn't get the job done we've got to move on that's all we got an aren't we easily in a different\nDirection with our producer for this this shift\nNo heat and that will not go to\nDifferent ... where do I get a different direction yeah exactly right I I went to\nIraq should have gone right now is off to London about nine thirty eastern time and again if I'm a season ticket holder of an NFL team\nAnd my teen takes that one game to London I'm kinda ... I really am I Want to see all the way home games I really do I that's what I paid for and I don't want to have to have one game off the scale and going to London england but that's just the way it is the titans of playing the charge is not a bad game today\nAnd believe it or not I have the lines I got the line so they go ... okay emulate charges LA charges given up what mine is six and a half\nThe ... of course it's right\nLook how much I watch the car I thought yeah I was in line at the what the updated lines I Love you and they were like reading the newspaper and going by Tuesday\nWhatever the line was that day I don't know how long we've been doing this show two years yeah now you're getting ... adds up data gap what are you got it said that would well I'll\nTell you why because I realized it is some sort of somewhat of a public service when you talk about these gays many people do way joined the games and although I'm not a big wager okay I gotta believe there are people out there that listen to was not only for the entertainment value when the information value but for the\nWay during his if for no yeah I I give it out and you tell them if you sent me right All right that's\nRight ... well hey man Andy sometimes\nSometimes we got to be shamed into doing the right things in life you know your exhibit happens early your parents are like what are you doing come on get it together\nIf that's what I was doing what you for a little bit it was a British aid that yeah we yeah we see it but yeah how about this game Andy where you look at Tennessee they allow ... eleven attacks last week to the Baltimore Ravens\nIn a game eleven debt is unheard of you look at the titans they'd do play soft event they give up only Seventeen point eight points per game\nSo can they slow down Philip Rivers and company yeah the question is\nCan they keep up scoring wise\nDepending on how much they blow 'em down because even if they hit their average against the chargers do you feel comfortable\nThat the titans can score twenty points today [laughter] here's your bottom line about that\nNo here's the bottom line about about the titans\nWhat is wrong but walk as Murray older I mean he was like everybody is like you know flavor of the month when he came into the league and he's done I mean he's he's he's exploded imploded it's finished I mean really and I don't think that tendency can stop the running game of Melvin Gordon and full of rivers is really having one heck of a season though as far yeah Mario to he's\nSo I had to build up the other day yeah yeah I I don't see how the bears against the dolphins look that crap id and then come back to Chicago they're playing the patriots at home and all of a sudden their lights out\nI think that they still struggle if the dolphins get the better of the bears to the tune that they did last week to that degree I just don't see how the patriots are completely struggling all day today I don't see it\nWell the funny thing is they started the sees as a house on fire with three wins in a row that the three when they hit the dolphins and they lost that game\nAnd I think it was all about the defense really I mean talk about your business and what he's done but it may but it's really got those three wins in a row and the deepest was way out of kilter last week but whatever the reason I mean if I was shocked I Am and I don't think that's going to happen again today\nWhere's the impressive win for the bears disease and\nThey beat the sea hawks okay got it right I was asked the cardinals they won sixteen to fourteen they struggle to a win against the cardinals and then they blew the doors off of Tampa Bay\n... you'd think that basic good theme of the of course not you know so I don't see and it's not to say the bears are incapable of beating a good team they just happen to this point they haven't been impressive where you're like hey man this is the team you got to look out for if you've got a ...

Washington Penn State all going down\nYour number five Notre Dame escape just by the city\n... hairs was a when a pitch a yesterday so basically it was a you know I look at the schedule yesterday it it shouldn't have played out that way but it\nTurned out to be a tremendous day and in college football perhaps maybe the best game of the day was the seventeenth right Oregon topping Washington thirty twenty seven and no tea and it's a huge rivalry between Washington Oregon and marry a crystal ball has got the ducks running this year they really do\nTake a listed is that\nIf it ever developed a metal\n\n[laughter]\n\nAll right [laughter]\n[noise]\nOh\n\nYeah she said it was a big day though we did that they needed a risk field goal attempt at the end the regulation to stay alive with us we'll take it they won that game I mean that's how it is that there are five and one to one now and the pack and the Washington goes down five and two and\nThree and one overall and basically they're finished Washington's finished for the year there'll be some minor little bowl game that there'll be playing in this year [noise] [noise] yeah\nUm [noise] I mean it's a redemption for CJ for Dell he's the running back ooh fumbled at the end regulation against Stanford\nWhen they were trying to basically run the clock out and that led to stand for beating the ducks just a few weeks ago in the same field and CJ for Dell is the young running back who scored the winning touchdown and overtime and you just heard right there\nAgainst Washington monster when for Mario crystal ball and you mentioned it Andy it's just that physicality Oregon's known for all their bubble screen you and it's just\nBasketball on grass and their prancing around and having a really nice time but they get after you man you got Mario crystal ball former offensive lineman at Miami\nAnd before the game he was leading these pre game warm up it's all on the line he's just preaching physicality and you could see it on Saturday against Washington\nAnd they're back I mean the ducks it back that kind of a couple of years where they were I got to the picture but they're right back in and right now and it's all about the huskies I mean honestly to hit I mean they were done yesterday afternoon to liberate lost that hurt them\nBasically as well so they're finished and now the ducks now you hope they don't ... you know hit a wall now Bush this week they play Washington state\nWhich I Believe what's off yesterday so that's somewhat rested so there'll be like to believe or good so we'll see what happens of Oregon could continue they fall on their face and we'll see what happens you know what he was real or not but this time right now just\nTell you that you it's a packed twelve is dead and determined to getting a playoff team because like Oregon non conference schedule is essentially use the apps schedule [laughter] that would break down and you have Oregon playing Bowling Green Portland State San jose state\nYou're not going to get into the playoffs unless all of these other teams and other major conferences just lose multiple games which good luck with that happening so that the downside of playing this sharman soft non conference\nSo that's the downside of playing this sharman soft non conference schedule if you have a last like Oregon does in the packed well you're done in terms of the playoff race\nRight and you don't want them honestly the pack twelve I'm sure they wanted to get a major conference in that bowl championship series and if you run the Congress maybe there's a chance to Washington last year but now it's certainly opens the door for the independent your independent Notre Dame I mean no did they should be really running the table they had a\nLittle bit of a heads up yesterday at home you know they'd be fence came to play the officers butterick a little bit but they did beat pit they held on Nineteen forty but honestly looking at the schedule like we said it

light matter of fact he didn't look good Thursday night but they're coached ... said they wouldn't be that change listen to what he said\nWell we believe in it or\nHow how do you believe in this guy I mean I Know the two Super Bowls I get it I Know he went what twenty four for forty three Thursday night at an interception it was shot four times and his problem is this his problem is this because this completion percentage is almost the Korea best as she is just ... percent but at thirty seven years of age\nHe's not knowable and it can never turned a shock if there were scramble that's the problem that is the ballot\nYelling that guy he's never been that guy ever it's like Brett Farr that there's a couple of weeks ago\nHe was like you got to protect the guy\nYeah it's like oh dealt that are going to run that going to get out of the pocket yeah that's what he's always been\nOkay so you have to have a legitimate offensive line he lie it stunk it up I'm not trying to say he has a has put to point the finger only at number ten instead of that horrible offensive line inside joke\nIt is a flat out a way that joke that you could always look at that our fence of lying to\nYou he was shot four times as they are going one step further\nThey talked about the Pittsburgh Steelers the last couple of weeks being dysfunctional with Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger I Would tell you right here and now the New York football giants might be the most dysfunctional team in the world of sports and I'll go one step\nFurther you know that we've talked about this ... about the lack of TV ratings which is a joke and people not going to the games which is a joke because every other professional sports league would die to\nHave the the media attention of the national football league has TV ratings maybe down a bit and maybe crowd that down a bit you know why because it costs like hotel Beckham junior the fans out there are fed up what more on like this that the this out there that says go out there and just go\nCrazy and it's an I I mean the world that's basically what it is and people like me are fed up with it how's that\nLook at shoo man you're out of the gate with some

add obey J I like it but look bad this the way I look at it\nYou're right he is all about himself\nHe is the I said he's like the beginning of the song crazy train from ... you know that song where it's like I I I I can do in your he's all about himself it was amazing that interview he did with Joe Siena Anderson from ESPN every word out of his miles every other sentence was I\nWas like I I've worked too hard I feel like I put it in the work I I just said the ball is just I I I Me me me he is that guy and I think that it's too late for the behavior to be changed because he didn't like this not just as easy either like this for years\nAnd ... not be addressed it's literally like a kid whose parents doesn't say no no no can't do that and follows through with the punishment if they misbehave it is far too late for OPEC um junior to turn it around and act right because the bad behavior has gone unpunished for far too long\nOn punished he gets his way Ninety five million dollar contract what are you kidding me I mean come on\nI mean it's crazy but you know what if the teachers want to do that God Bless you it's not my money it's your money they go oh you said earlier the eagles would make the playoffs they need they could buy diesel up across that division of the plane is so bad now that went against the giants Thursday night maybe fool's gold with the when they're three and three that are Carolina next week so look\nThey may make the playoffs I remember last week you an ... without a little bit Alex said that you were wrong you know I respect you for your opinion and and look they're not the same thing they were a year ago but it just look who they're playing with in that division the giants the Redskins come on they're tearing these things are bad Dallas that they're not consistent winners these teams\nYou know what there was a fork in the road this morning and you shows Alex ... says over your guy me on my own I just I just mentioned that have the way the Alex ... dark side how dare you Andy ferment I Do understand what I'm saying I get it I understand it\nBut I still look at this eagles team and it's just hilarious to me because\nThey beat the horrible one in five now New York giants and that's all it took for people to be like hey goes or back look at what they did to a one in five team who cares it's going to take a lot more than that\nTo not only when the division but get the playoffs so I still think it's very very possible that they lose\nA the division that they don't make it into the playoffs I Am not convinced that this team is going to be able to string together a bunch of wins I'm not and you look at the Washington Redskins team\nGranted they looked terrible against the saints but it's a big game at home against the Carolina Panthers that if they win it gets what Washington Redskins are headed that division they're on top\nSo I didn't I did Joe I dislike that people have the eagles in Penn\nThat only winning the division but being a playoff team they are in pencil they might get there I'm not saying it's the lack of the century that they don't but to have them written in ... as if there's no way they could possibly screw this thing up it's silly to me it's the NFL we see these things happen every single year\nI have a surprise to you I live out his game splits lines dot com um well hang on one and a half\nHour Andy you are you're making strides man you are making strides you got the spread of the game you know my heart is I've got a little bit\nHere you know what though I got it all I got over an under\nA plus fifty and a half and I got Bengals honest one and a half so I mean you know I'm I'm doing you've taught me well\nI got to I I gotta I gotta give the right the rise\nThat amazing thing it's just outstanding yes\nI just learned how to turn it on I just got one really just got a computer really it just got an Internet over there right [laughter] yeah maybe yeah just depends\nI mean it depends different you know books and different lines but right around there I've got a minus one for the bangles it's moved you can see the Steelers money trickle in throughout the week and the total fifty one what would you take on that and he would you go over on that\nI Would go over and you don't want them I I honestly I I\nI'm not a whole more but I think the fact that they're playing the home of the things have a little bit of ... momentum going on their side but the injury factor I don't know I look at a close game right now like thirty one twenty seven thirty one twenty eight Bengals but I I got to hear what you have to say about it I like I have a tough\nWhen because I'm torn I never want to take the results of the previous week and apply it too much like over the top with the next week you know and so watching the bangles they were getting dominated by the dolphins they were getting shot out by the dolphins\nAnd tannahill but what are the worst throwaways I've ever seen before\nThrows it just a massive humanity it gets knocked around picked off\nInterception for a touchdown another defensive score\nSo the bangles the way they want good luck seeing not repeat you know so I'm trying not to overreact to that result last week because the Bengals are completely capable playing a lot better today against the Steelers defense that's up and down I expected to be a shootout\nAnd I expected to come down to a fourth quarter game and I can't sit here and say I would bet my bottom dollar and the bangles making the play when it comes time for it I Would bet on the Steelers until proven otherwise\nI'll tell you what I'm with you and I think the weather's a factor because uh they predict rain at least the second half of the ball game this afternoon which will make a real sloppy and I don't know where the passing situation will happen with the rain and so\nI I just I I think that the Steelers joined the bangles head I know it sounds really stupid but I Know it's a mental game I just think that when the bangles team she used a black and gold something happens that they've got a real tight but\nAs something will happen is that the guy like I don't miss a goal of is a special team era today may may cause that game so we'll see what you get\nFined says perfect back you know and of course the shades of the unnecessary roughness penalty on Antonio Brown and the playoff games like\nOh gosh yeah I I Do wonder how much of the recent history\nFactors into the bangles mindset today in the thick of a guy like Joe ... than just off the top of my head or John Ross one of these young guys that has it been there for a long time\nTo experience the Steelers typically getting the better of the bangles at least of recent memory is able to you know one sixth straight games so I don't know that enters in their mind set\n... elected in their mind I'll tell you how it's going to do in their mind when when Marvin\nLouis ... speech and tell us that we're
