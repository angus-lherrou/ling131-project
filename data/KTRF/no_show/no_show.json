... chapter to\nWhere the apostle Paul says through the law I die to the law so that I might live to God I've been crucified Christ\nIs no longer I live with Christ who lives in me and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the son of God who love me and gave himself for me\n\nPaper haven't received a call and a promise from\nGod\nGod said to him go from your country from your kindred your father's house that I Will make you a great nation Sarah with other son stabbed mission everlasting covenant with you and with him and with his descendants after him this was very\nSpecial for Abraham\nEveryone though has a unique calling then includes\nBlessings and sacrifices Abraham made sacrifices you had to go from his country's kindred his father's house in San you had to leave all of that high\nBut there were great promises and blessings that came to him too and everyone has a calling that includes blessings and sacrifices and everyone must\nWalk his own past\nThe path that God has called him to walk what is right for someone else may not be what God chose for you what God chose for Abraham was right for Abraham\n\nBut it's not what he chose for me it's not the ... the life that he called me to live each one must live his own life and you can compare yourselves with others you can compare your sacrifices with their sacrifices or your blessings with their blessings\nBut [noise] I encourage you to do that\nI encourage you to think about the calling that came to you and to celebrate the blessings that God bestowed upon you and to bear the burdens to God calls upon you to bear and to thank God for the blessings and and and perhaps even thank him for the burdens because there's a reason\nWhy God has sent them serve God and the way he chose\nHomelessness was a part of Abrahams calling\nIn because he was homeless everywhere he went he was a stranger in ... and and alien there was an element of fear\nHe did not have the rights of a citizen in the countries in which he lived he did not have the protections of the law that were granted to citizens he was a stranger and an alien and there was an element of fear that manifest itself\nIn Abrahams life and behavior particularly\nWith regard to his wife we see in a couple of occasions that he was afraid for his own life because he had a beautiful wife and he thought first the Egyptians would kill him to get his wife away from him and then later on he was afraid of the people of ...\nThe wife away from him and then later on he was afraid of the people of gr are into them elect the king of gr are and in those instances he lied and said she's not my wife she's my sister\nFrom God dealt with him and dealt with the people of Egypt and a pharaoh and dealt with a ... and the king of gr are\nEmbroiled delivering statement but Abraham was aware of his vulnerabilities that's the point that I'm a traveling toward he was aware of his weakness he was aware of his dependence he needed God's help and care and no matter who we are\nWe need God's help and care our lives are in God's hands\n\nGod used Abrahams vulnerabilities as homelessness his status as an alien and a foreigner to teach him that lesson\nFrom God will teach us those of us who are his children and walk in his ways and believe in him as our redeem earn savior God will teach us to\nThat we need to be dependent on him and God will teach us to pray give us this day our daily bread I Hope you will I Hope we will learn the lessons certainly God will present it people present the lesson hopefully we will learn the lesson\nAnd learn to pray give us this day our daily bread recognizing that it isn't our money in the bank that guarantees are daily bread\nBut it is God who gives it to us day by day\nEven though Abraham ... lived in in a certain element of fear\nThat\nHe he possess wealth and power and they were among the blessings that he received\nAbraham had within his household three hundred and Eighteen men who were trained for war train for for battle that's pretty impressive for the household of a nomad\nThat's a pretty good sized household to include three hundred and Eighteen man this is something we read about in genesis chapter fourteen\n\nAnd he took his three hundred and Eighteen our men and went to rescue the kings of Saddam and Gomorrah when they were attacked and conquered by an uh an alliance of enemy kings and they were being carried away as prisoners of war\nAbraham was concerned I suppose primarily for his nephew law too was living in the city of Saddam and was being carried away with the other prisoners of war but\nWhatever his motivation he took his men and went and liberated the people of Saddam and the people have been more from the army that had captured them and that was taking them away as prisoners of war\nOn the kingdom Saddam was naturally grateful and wanted to reward Abraham but Abraham refused his gift because Abraham said uh I don't want you to be telling people I made Abraham rich I gave him great gift\nAbraham wanted God to get the credit for the fact that he was rich which he\nWas God gave Abraham wealth and power\nAnd he gave Abraham those gifts for his own pleasure and to use for the benefit of others with every gift comes responsibility no matter who you are you must do the right thing with the gifts that God has given you\nIs it inconsistent to say on the one hand that Abraham was dependent upon God and uh his life was entirely in God's hands and then to say on the other hand that he was a man of wealth and power\nNot at all men of wealth and power are always dependent on God\nWe see in Abrahams life that he learned patients and face the hard way he learned by waiting\n\nAnd as he waited waiting is hard it was hard for him just like it's hard for us he did things he shouldn't have done\nHis wife Sarah was also waiting for the sun to be born the guarded promised or for any child to be born into her home and she said ... go into my mate\nShe offered her servant Hagar\nHurt Egyptian servant girl to Abraham said we will will have children this way and Abraham yielded to them when he was eighty six years old hegar bore Ishmael\nTo him and Abraham loved him and he prayed to God oh that Ishmael my living you're safe but God said no that's not the way of it later on Sarah\nAh when I was born she saw that there was competition between Ishmael and her son Isaac and she didn't want that she said ... get rid of this slave woman and her son and had displeased Abraham 'cause he loved the son\n\nOf God so did her hand this is the way it must be you must do this thing but gun had compassion on on Abraham and on the sun that Abraham love and God was with the lab we read in genesis Twenty one and he grew and grew out in the wilderness and became an archer\nAnd he'd go out in the land of pay around his mother took him away from the land of Egypt and so on God looked out first male\nAnd took care of him because rides a love for Abraham then eventually\nA brand was Ninety nine years old guard came and said now's the time in the spring cerebral Verizon so on and it was hard for him to believe that but the lord visited Sara Sara conceived and when ... was a hundred years old\nI Isaac was born what a miracle that was\nAnd when Abraham saw the power of God demonstrated in that miracle Abraham knew\nThat going to do anything and he learned patients by waiting and he learned to trust by seeing God do what couldn't be done a brown said there is no way that a hundred year old man and a nine year old woman can have a son that just can't happen\nBut it did\nAnd when Abraham saw that then he knew and believe that God could do anything and that God always fulfilled his promise even when it can't be done and Abrahams faith became an example\nMath we'll ever recall\nThat I'll watch the\nNow now I'm\nDa\nDa\nDa da\nLa la\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nGet away with anything\n\nRain [laughter]\nWere ... ... ...

Democratic leader how do you do that\nSo uh what's your thinking and I were standing Nunberg well on Monday or Tuesday coming up next to David re\nThere's been a lot of reporting and now CNN stop reporting it because it's good for Trump about tens of thousands coming here from\nUh El Salvador Nicaragua and a hunt doors and the health concerns think about the health concerns when thousands of human beings are not inoculated numerous dozens of different diseases there not\nBeen checked and they're living in squalid conditions for weeks walking through heating jungles and what's the medical risk might be ...\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nOf the so called the migrants are young males between the ages of Fifteen and thirty it's impressive oh for a woman with a baby to walk two thousand miles\nThrough jungles in the heat and sand in desert that ain't gonna happen somebody's organizing on this much like the boat live from Juba there are lumped as politicians who hate Trump and want to destroy America and they want to flood the southern border right now there is Fifteen and twenty thousand why not Fifteen or twenty million\nWell you know there are forty one million people in Central American I bet a good deal of them have their eyes on what's happening here and how we handle it the problem is that we have gaping loopholes in our asylum laws and if anyone in this caravan no matter what even if they said on national television ten times\nThat they're coming here for a job as you've heard people say all I wanted a job in Los Angeles when they put one toe in the United states they say the words political asylum\nAnd they are in like Flynn they are here they're going to be released into the country and they're going to be on a backlog of probably as long as three to four years\nNever showing up for their cases eighty percent of these folks who exploited the asylum loopholes never show up for their cases and simply disappear into the United states this is a gimmick they're using our own policies twice this year the Republican Congress has tried to close these loopholes\nAnd they have not had a single democratic vote\nTo uh to do so and you asked to ask yourself why who really benefits in the long run for Massey illegal immigration\nWhen you look at studies of immigrants as they become citizens and how they vote sixty five percent of them end up registering as democratic\nColors I forgot to government assistance but\nYeah I mean you're barely making it you're going to vote for the party that hand you the most goodies\nAnd ah you know twenty five percent a vote Republican but if you think about you know twelve million illegal aliens a sixty five percent of them would end up becoming citizens and voting Democrat that would that would that have thrown every American election to the Democrats in the last Twenty years and every one for probably the next forty\n... and the other issue you read and democratic literature is that if and when Texas flipped to the Democratic party and becomes a deep blue state\nThe way the politics will be fashion for the next twenty to fifty years there'll be no chance for a Republican ever to win the presidency again in Texas is a blue state and you might throw in Florida because California for most of its history was a deep red thing Ronald Reagan heritage easily Nixon Gehring raised like\nCalifornia flip it goes with illegal migration\nTerrorized as the next target Texas flips and it's over but David Wray affair here here's a question Trump is talking in the way I Would like him to talk he's normal he reflects Midwestern values conservative values\nHe's saying the army or the national guard will not let them cross in America\nHow do you physically stop maybe twenty or thirty thousand people in mass from getting one toe into American soil then blaming political refugee status how physically we're not going to shoot them there's well ... how do you actually stop 'em\nThat's the million dollar question without going into Mexico because I'm really ...\n... that that is the question and I don't know that anybody has the answer to that I'll tell you how you would stop them if it existed Trump's border wall if you had a border wall there they wouldn't be walking in the United states except through legal ports of entry or they would have to walk way out into the desert in Arizona or to come over\nThat's why we need the border wall and some of these heavy crossing points but that's all it takes\nIs one ... in the United states and we're done and you and you're done and orange on the long list vote yeah and all we need to do is\nAnd so fair has called called we believe this is the beginning of a national emergency just like the Mariel boatlift was we've asked that Congress the president calls Congress back to Washington\nThis week to close these asylum loopholes if we could close these asylum loopholes or if we could put asylum courts with detention centers right on the border so as they came over\nSet ask for political asylum they had their hearing and they were immediately sent home because Ninety nine percent of these folks would not qualify ... for political asylum their economic migrants than we would have an end of this nonsense we can't get those loopholes closed now Congress failed twice\nThey're going to we think they should come back and close these loopholes anything short of that\nAnd and it's kind of a a you know a cat and mouse game we have to try to keep them from getting in the United\nThe ears are probably very for takes ten Democrats United States Senate to move legislation\nRight now there's fifty one there might be fifty four fifty five after the election whatever the number is unique numerous Democrats\nTo switch party line vote with the Republicans in order to say that much like Mexicans of Mexicans come here and they get one foot and the taxes they're thrown back immediately into Mexico and you're done we ever a loophole in the law that says you're from\nYou made it late in Mexico and you're done we ever a loophole in the law that says your ... from Central America Asia Africa and you're making do America no matter how you get her legally or illegally and you claim refugee status for political purposes that then you begin in the hearing process that takes three to ten years\nSo unless the Democrats agree to do this\nNo changing the law will happen I mean Trump God Bless him I Love him or he can tough tough only once\nBut you cannot stop twenty thousand people or twenty million people from flooding our southern border from Central America claiming refugee status they have no shots they have no medical Clarence them no financial support\nThey have no work skills that we need most less than a third grade education and there's nothing we can do to stop them unless the Democratic party agrees and what makes you think they're ever going to agree\nWell I mean at some point maybe they're going to put the national interest of their own political interests is that my pipe dream yeah\nNo it won't happen that that's why I feel bad I feel terrible yeah\n[noise] yeah I mean the president really is extremely limited in what he can do in his best bet is to try to get the Mexican stopped them in Mexico\nBecause once they get to the U.S border they're going to walk you know five miles outside of the port of entry and they're going to step right over a fence and they're going to be in the United states hoping that they get apprehended in fact if they see the border patrol they'll run towards them\nTo ask for political asylum and then it's all over and until we get these detention facilities on the border with these asylum courts as we did in the late Nineteen nineties when Central Americans were pulling this\nA stick with us till we get that back in turn these cases around and get these asylum loopholes or a close we are going to be stuck with this mess\nWell I I I don't know I'm filled with hope all the time but I\nYeah I Love Mexico says to the Trump bring the United States Army one or two or three miles into Mexico and politically that would be the death knell of the Mexican president if he allowed American Soldiers on the Mexican territory that ain't gonna happen and you know I think there's not going to happen\nIs the Mexican president was elected\nAnd I just recently under an open borders policy and what she wants free flow of information I don't know what we can do other than bitch complain and moan at the end of the day the Democrats aren't going to agree to this and so unless they get hammered at the at the ballot box and Nancy plus it goes down hard a week from Tuesday and\nDemocrats get hurt in the Senate ... ... ... we don't need we need about ten Democrats the United states senators\nTo get the same treatment as Central Americans that we get the Mexicans ... which means that view here illegally immediately or send back they'll have to go through a hearing process the liberal activists attorneys are there\nAre the news media is their Kamala Harris and all

today's show Jeremy wonder how much what the department of natural resources the CEO is going to be joining us and we'll talk\nOr any new laws out there and um what is a trespassing what is in a taco and take your questions certainly sixty one twelve thirty all of that is coming up on the show today a and of course or something we've added sense you know last year ... one of our more popular shows\nSo they have to all be using I'm the same implement in order to cross paper tape for somebody else\nAren't a six day one to all dirty and you have a question sixty one twelve thirty call in if you want it back to your question and you can do that to six day one one two three here on texting okay dean our question is as Ken anything be done to limit or detour road hunting in my area\nAnd it doesn't say where his area as well let's just talk about it in general and rode hunting\nOkay a road hunting is for the lazy hunters um they don't want to get cold they don't want to sit out in you know the stand and wait for the year to come or maybe they don't know anything about scouting and and your trails and work at it you know intercept the animals and things like that I'm usually when you wrote hunting you're doing a couple of violations one shooting from the roadway at a big game animal into ...\nUm it's not very safe because you're shooting and probably towards the woods where there could be folks inside that you don't know what's beyond your target\nUm as far as eliminating it or make sure that you have you're landlocked we posted that helped me out of time 'cause that's another violation and get to the folks\nThe land isn't legally posted um we don't get to prosecute and I remember a cultural land does not need to be posted and nice to have permission in order to go on to or shoot on people so if you have your agricultural land um\nThey can't legally shoot on to that or go on to your property without your permission other than to retrieve even on a lawfully shot at him [noise] so if you do have issues in your area and you have an awful lot of road hunting get a hold of myself get a hold of Ben human or get a hold somebody else and let us know the area at times that are the most frequent\nWhat types of vehicles you're seeing you know the same way pick up comes by six eight time\nI'll let us know or we can use utilize some of our other tools um maybe we can utilize the decor and maybe we can utilize I'm just sitting in one area and waiting for life you were to come out\nUm so there are some things we can use to deter it unfortunately a folk stress like myself are few and far between for a pretty big area right now and we will after this year season beginning one more person to the area to help us out a little bit but if you do have problems with that persistent wrote hunting\nOne make sure he lands lawfully posted and find well so they can see that in to\nUh get a hold on myself or another contribution after we can see what we can do as far as I'm trying to eliminate that issue for you\nKnow and sometimes they're not ruin hunting sometimes they're just doing lunch\nSometimes oh for sure because I Know that's one of our rituals ... after we've done in the morning on a bus mid day I'm hungry enough us so we are up in the vehicle we drive around just looking at a hunters the area and and eat our lunch so not always ruined hunting when you're driving around\nSure and and that's true and I'm renting has actually I I Would like to think of as myself but his corrupted a little bit but I don't know if that's actually the issue um I think it's more along the lines of how people are hunting is well we used to have the big parties that would go out and do a lot of dear Dr pushing to Europe running left and right here and there\nOh yeah that's true yeah and what made it way more um easy for the the road hunters have the deer kicked out running around in a shootout that a lot more folks are sitting in the stands\nHunters have the deer kicked out running around and jump off shoot out that a lot more folks are sitting in the stands utilizing food lots things like that so we have we left you are running out willy nilly for one would to the other but it's a lemonade a little bit of a road hunting but not all of it and like you said there are certain folks just drive around and that's what they do for their lunch or their mid day just to see a you know who else is out maybe your next book\nUh companies pick up and talk a little bit but if I'm assuming this guy is complaining about folks that are coming you know that last half hour of shooting time yeah the same vehicle going up and down three or four or five times along certain roadways and stuff\nSure All right so it has\nGone down quite a bit my trespassing she wrote complaints have went down um [noise] dramatically since I first started here\nWell that's good that is a good thing must be on the ... it's an open mind\nYeah so that's got to be at people or [laughter] you know there's a learning is alright\nWe had another caller on the line from Galen on the line now you're on the line with Jeremy when a rummage go ahead\nI'm Sorry uh yeah I kept a you know a mine is a bad guy or a\n... a ...\nShirt on the\nUm do you have the permit them Galen have you uh down through the application process I'm gotten the permit to shoot first any motor vehicle right\nThat you have that you already have gotten that taking care yeah\nOkay so you have that then so basically you cannot transport and loaded firearm loaded firearms are not allowed to be transported even if you have that handicap a permit you got to unload your fire and before you transport it and you must be out of the road right of way\nBut you can't be sitting on the road and shooting out of the vehicle the vehicle must be out of the road right away in order to lots of issue that big it other than that it's basically if you've already got that handicapped permit for the perfect issue for standing motor vehicle\nUm that should be your only basic limitation while the other things it's nice for you and it doesn't benefit you this much or is that much this year is it when you have that permit to shoot from standing motor vehicle you don't have to apply for a do prevent\nThat permit to shoot from standing motor vehicle allows you to shoot either an analyst or an outward dear I'm no matter what does ignition the uh [noise] uh\nUh that uh if if the weather's lottery or not whether or not you know do come at\nHome I guess I didn't know that yet so I have that truth from standing motor vehicle permit now up here we don't have any lottery I've got a hunters choice whereas it use it or that the one year\nAnd then manages a tutor limit and intensive is a preview or limit so up here we don't have to worry about lottery but if there is years in the future um you can harvest an outlet us here without a permit as long as you're the one that harbors that you can't party hunt with somebody else and we can choose to do that and put your take on it but you could do it yourself as long as\nYou have to shoot from motor vehicle from\nYeah thank you very much I guess I rarely joke girl but uh yeah I guess are are under ...\nAnd the only other thing I ever see usually as an issue with the folks with that permit is that the transport their gun laws they forget to unload them before they drive way more there were sitting there and I got you got unloaded and out of that road right away and you're\nGoing to go do do they have but Jeremy do they have like a you know like a handicap still going to hang on their mirror then to so you you were to get a little\nA little blue ... they should have just looks like one of our licenses that they carry with them as well in addition to their license it's a little blue tang that they should have that\nAnd they all they don't have to replace it as a black or anywhere anywhere on it just when I Would come to see him um if I watch them from the vehicle to your produce that may be good to go\nPick up okay All right well thanks for the call appreciate it a\nSix day one twelve thirty were visiting Jeremy went around much with the ah department of natural resources on we're going to get a news headline here and just a few minutes but we have another call insults go back to the phones Wayne is on a year with Jeremy went around between go ahead\n[noise] hey Derek I'm first you're talking about a ... ... what about your ... and then Trump ordering afterward um you know like ... for the person still need to be retired here even after a season or schools or\nExcellent question though if you do have that here already registered then you can put on a piece of paper could be anything from a map into a tablet paper or whatever\nUm that that uh this person that is ... here for you have your permission because right on there that a mark Allen is going for transport my ear for me from and to something like that but once it registered the license he does not need to a company and uh they just have to have some piece of paper showing who for three transporting it where they are going\nAnd then find by the ... on dirt during season also then or\nYeah as long as it's registered for though it has to if you have to register for and then at the license the is not where they have to have that piece of paper showing with life in the ... given that perfect permission to transport it from\nThis place to that place oh primary harm to the locker plan or something like that here also nope just has to be with him because actually okay\nAnd then second question um I Know it's somebody's got a food bought the gruesome corn and this year and I got rather tall and they were talking about ... shooting lands what that would go down as Beijing then doesn't it\nCorrect unfortunately um but we have in our baiting a lot of that you cannot be out or any of the things that have been grown but if you go there with your brush hog and your crop and on all your corner scattering all that corn all around I understand the Koran got kind of high and they should remember for next year the cheap laughs the open road or something like that you can see in there\nUm what other option would be is if you remove all the cops from a couple of ... I don't know how big a food but we are talking\nWith you remove all the cob and got them out of there then you could cut down on the um the\nStocks and remove it 'cause then you're not scattering the bait\nBut I mean depending on the size of their corn or their food but if it's too big and it's just not going to be feasible but as long as you're not are gathering or exposing or anything like that so people sometimes want to fill up their sugar beet or brush ride on you can't do either of those options says or in the book right under our baiting lot pocketbook scattering exposing things like that\nOr for ... great\nThank you I think when I go to Jim\nYep sixty one twelve thirty is our number if you want to call in or text us on our a Pizza Hut text line six eight one one two three zero sixty one twelve thirty is the phone number to call I Jeremy hang on the lines of just a minute we're going to get a news update and we'll come back with more questions for Jeremy winner homage\nAh again conservation officer joining us to answer any questions about the Iran coming up\nThis weekend the season get started but first or before you back to Jeremy let's get a news headline up data and there's\nSome news Bernstein good morning\nAmerica and landing on his face Stearns county authorities are searching for a missing team couple in their infant son anyone was information on Seventeen year old Morgan steak Nineteen year old James spans and they are six month old son Bobby is ask all the weight park police departments\nAlso deer stands are going up all across Minnesota which means deer stand deaths are not far behind the loose police department asked to help the public in identifying to people caught stealing donate trailed him near observation road\nAnd the portion of highway two in Polk County will be closed this week for bears to the railroad crossing crews will be replacing concrete between Fifth Avenue northeast and county road Seventeen and these Grand Forks little details on those stories more coming up at noon for twelve thirty ... radio news someday burns\nAs long as they don't have an open license and the president for president so or I seen it violated sometimes as folks will build their leg and then they want to go back out hunting for the buy one for a wife or grandma or daughter or son or somebody else and then they're not out and president actively hunting\nThat's not a lawful party huh so in order to lawfully party you can do just like you said though once you harvest that you're here you can go and still helped down by pushing would want it as long as you're you know a field with the person with a a ... day and treat the deer and as long as they're there to take it you're going to go okay well thank\nYou well you answered my question I think David appreciate it so I yeah six one\nTwelve thirty Jeremy wonder how much is our guest with the department of natural resources you have a question give us call we have GPS on the line gp you're on a Jeremy go ahead\nMorning Jeremy thanks very much more to get pretty good job I'm just a couple of questions to clarify the previous two questions that were asked I'm just like bears he's in a leap stands on WMA land do doctors now for deer she still need to have their being our number on the on the stand\nAnd my second question is\nUm if you are with they tend to Fifteen year old I'm a competing them as if your license punter can you still bring your fire in\nExcellent questions and I'm Glad you brought that up because it is a good point I'm just like for bear hunting if you do leave your stand in the WMA it must be identified so you got to have either you or do you and our number or your name and address on it just like you would for bear on the very good point there the other part is if you have a valid license um\nAnd and and like I guess I should clarify is this during the season or during the regular part I'm\nGonna hang up and hug him I must hung up I guess okay so um\nDuring the regular farm season the metric hunt or excuse me during the youth season the metro country cannot carry a firearm and cannot on during the regular firearms season if you have a ten or eleven year old with you use and you have a valid license you still can have your fire I'm with you and you still going on\nThey just have to still be within arm's reach a view so there is no limitations during the\nRegular firearms season to bring youth with so you can still be able to hunt moms are dads can still hunt with juveniles we're um we're in the UCs when they could not their license wasn't ballot yet\nSo but yes you can if you have about license or you can carry a firearm and still hunt even if you have a juvenile with ya\nOkay and I think a gp is back on the line with us again ... story\nI got disconnected but that answers both but in\nA very good either I married three sheets\nTo appreciate your clarifying that from ... to put that in there but yet they stand damages left really the only they have to be left with your identification on a very good\nYes yes and thanks for the call I'm sixty one twelve thirty call or text and we do have a couple of text or questions coming in and let's get to that well one of the comments says just seen as small bug chasing a dull [laughter]\nSomebody out there and here's the wind and says can a person Honda waterfall on a field that was never harvested\nYes as long as it's not manipulated now that's a federal regulation of bigger federal regulations will talk about natural farming practices and manipulation like if the field wasn't harvest it and then they burned it off\nIt's not a normal farming practice and that would be considered a bated by federal law but if you're saying the cornfield that wasn't harvest it or soy beans or something else that um the birds are utilizing if it wasn't harvest it it's okay they can feel really haunted as long as the field has not been manipulated and they use that word in federal law\nSo it can be um [noise] you know burned out with the main thing is that it's too wet to harvest and they burn it\nUm that's not a normal farming practice in there would leave all the green out there that would be considered made it but if it's just stay standing field that hasn't been harvested that can be hard to\nSay what about a field that has been harvested that is that okay to\nThat legal don't that's legal to that small farming practice but they you harvest arbiter field\nRight okay legal to already six he went to all thirty a got a question says is it\nIs it legal for a game warden to walk into your house and check your freezer without a warrant\nNo absolutely not okay\nSo we don't violate both constitutional rights that's where the constitutional rights that when the other part about going onto somebody's property is like an open field doctrine um you really don't have that expectation of privacy to be out in the field where someone with an airplane or something like that would be able to see you anyway\nBut we don't go into people's houses we don't you don't get indoors without warrants and go looking freezers and things like that so same constitutional rights you had from any other police officer\nOr a another question says how many inches to the horn have to be see how many inches or the horn have to beat a claim it as a book um are here even if they're just\nA little [noise] [noise] ... ... it's still called the buck\nOkay so definition of a buck state statute says one time of at least three inches at one time at least three at least\nThree inches despite fucking one was broken off or to look through one if it's three inches in link or more has has to be considered an outlet deer\nIf it's less than three inches unlike it's considered and little is\nAll right um what are the shooting times this weekend due to the time changes on Saturday and Sunday\n\nBut the shooting hours never changes that was half hour before sunrise to ... hour after sunset or get on your smartphone and they'll tell you what times they are um I can look in the book and you tell you what we have\nYou know I was going to say it's it's random in the book there words are listed on on time so\nYeah so if you go back to pay if they want to look and page one twenty nine and one thirty\nThey'll have all the sunrise and sunset tables in there to make sure that you\nAnd since then able to go in there to make sure that you add your or you know put half hour before sunrise but then remember the world is round so the sun doesn't rise of\nExactly the same all over Minnesota right um it has that\nOn page one thirty and has that little diagram up on the top of the page that shows how many minutes you need to add to the heart and make it the right ah sunrise and sunset\nI very good uh and again it's half hour before sunrise to half hour after sunset\nCorrect hearing it for big game and a lot of folks don't realize that it's half hour before sunrise to sunset or small game let's say wrote hunting a grouse or migratory birds like waterfall ... you have to stop at sunset a lot of people still think they get that extra half hour like\nHer big game it's not the case so it's half hour before sunrise Tucson set for small ... and then here\nUm or big game is half hour before to half hour after\nOkay I'm Lucy or just a question can I can I hunter fish in South Dakota or North Dakota and I have a South Dakota and Minnesota limit in freezer\n[noise] as long as you do not have as long as it didn't come from the same body of water so like our border water let's say the red river in or if you have to go to fishing licence and Minnesota fishing licence\nOr you can have three Minnesota fish from the red river and three North Dakota fish from the red river\nSame as the would if you have your Canadian license and fish up there you can have your Manitoba limit at a buffalo bait Andrew Minnesota limit because it came from the same body of water if you have a mental a license and you are somewhere else other than like the word you could have that limit\nAnd your limit from uh Minnesota um or if you went to devils lake you can have in North Dakota limit and you're in Minnesota limit or in your freezer or but you cannot have\nA both limit if it's from the same body of water and that usually comes from our border waters of course Red River like the words you know the Mississippi down in the southeast things like that\nOr a next question during use can you have your side arm if you have a concealed carry\nA concealed carry you can have that with you a pretty much anything in our gimme fish rules except for shining activity\nSo while you're both hunting and you really are you're not supposed to have a fire I'm with you while you go on for dear if you have your concealed carry permit you can have your fire I'm with you that\nWe have a concealed carry permit you can have it with you while you're mentoring the youth um so you can have they're the only time that that concealed carry permit doesn't supersedes some game and fish laws as during shining activity so if you're out recreationally shining you know within two hours of sunset without the spot are located game with artificial light\nYou cannot have any firearm with you in the vehicle and that\nAlso includes your concealed carry permits to remember that if you folks have your concealed carry if you're going to go out and do some recreational shining and have you done with you while you're doing recreational trying\nTime Jeremy when Robert is with us or we're running out of time quicker but I still have more questions here are sixty one twelve thirty it's uh I'll open my here's one does the DNR steel feed the deer in the winter\nNo uh that's usually one of those things they really frowned upon um\nIt's it gets expensive uh and that's mainly ... more of a wildlife issue a rather than force meant but um it has to give you an extremely severe winter and I guess maybe up in the uh\nUm boundary waters area they maybe had put some feet out for him as a rule of thumb are you in our will not feed the deer during winter unless it's an extreme hardship and it would have decimated population I guess but that would be more of a ... a biological biological question to ask her while as manager instead of myself\nId and our question my neighbor put out a pile of sugar beets within eyesight of my dearest stand can I still use that stand\nAs long as you OK so two things have to take place that has to be on the other person property not on your property and as long as you did not a big part of or into the ... say hey buddy go put the beast on your side of the line next to me and I'll go put some meat semi sided\nLines you over [laughter] and I and I won't be looking at them you won't be looking at some basically\nWhat this locking them into a play was is there was a guy that on some land in his neighbors that are surrounded him didn't like him and didn't want to be able to hunt there so they would go put corn and sugar beets all around his property on their land\nClaim it as a beta area and the guy couldn't legally hunters on property wow it's not on your land and you're not akin to what you did not participate in it you're not say hey go do that for my benefit ah it's still a legal in lawful for you to hunter\nI absolutely right it is

join us for for the mouth watering Frank tonight at the river walk public out with the river falls radio\n[noise]\nOr he hit a brand Peterson numbers freaking on the right side and uh he throws a sixty three a a yard touchdown pass to Peterson to make it eight to six they would add on to point conversion and that would make it eight eight and that's you know that's the way we ended the for his staff but\nAfter these teams playing to the first half you can tell you know you could tell even from a with all the rain and everything that had fell that uh it was going to be a one of those games where ah\nIf you don't get to break or you don't jump on a a formal or something like that or the season for I'm going to be over\n[laughter] now did they did it rainy entire game and you had it so it was constantly raining so keeping the ball dry was it was horrible right I Am sure they had the ... out there and they're trying to keep it dry but but if it's constantly raining the grounds already soaking wet is pretty tough to keep\nThem seven I say is that the officials that a referee the game or one of them I Know him throughout his whole uniform after getting [laughter] yeah I mean you\nYou just said no but uh you know they are towels out there that are continuing it made a big difference I mean there's standing water\nIn how many how many how many ... if you\nCount the fund those from the center snap yeah never Seventy\nOkay how many turnovers were there and there were eight eight and a journalist so\nAnd that would be a big part of the game late in the game okay well let's get there then I go to the second half and uh of course the scores eight eight and kill your ... and they will put him in nice dry and together and they lose all are in bend Jordan Jordan again or would score from ... this time and\nOn that Dr he had Seventy three yards rushing he had every carry for a ... a failure north Holleman that a third quarter on that one drive\nYou finish it off with free yard run they would be a to point conversion once again it would make it sixty eight and a van as we got on the way into the fourth quarter and we'd get about seven minutes left\nTill you're north alone would pick up the kitchen county central formal they have the ball at the kitchen county's central I Believe twenty three yard line they were able to get all the way down inside the five and when they do they form old\nActually no I'm Sorry on that I cried I correct big cuts in county central held them on down a was a formal the possession before that but they held on downs\nI did say you know with six minutes to go into football game and they've got Ninety six yards to go\nI said boy gets in Comedy Central's not put a drive together tonight uh that would would be able to cover that Ninety six yards so what do they do first play from scrimmage\nAgain a they're running back a trend parents for years and now the signing ago Ninety six yards Ninety six yards is is a reverse play\nThe way you can join the backfield so\nHe got to the outside and you know everybody can get sucked in because most of the planes are in the middle of the thing yeah you know everybody's going to be any went around the right side and went down to the sidelines and uh\nThey had a couple of minutes tackles around midfield but after that he was own free awesome though it was awesome it was great the uh\nBring us up though it was awesome it was great the fans from ... north ... couldn't believe it or you know open the box there they they couldn't believe that that happened because they said oh sure so\nNinety six yard touchdown now okay so he scores but they still need the\nThey still need the a to point conversion gay and it would be the quarterback Josh running that would likely boy\nI tell you something to hundreds and he's six foot three two hundred and twenty five pounds again and I tell you that he had so little um more center snapped that he just went right and barrel right through the line now and you know the actually that was some of their biggest gains of the other night as\nHe finished off with the a to point through version there this time actually it rolls out to the right it wasn't going right through holiday so against you blanket version or Thai or type ... how much time on the clock uh when they scored\nThere was a ... for Seventeen\nLeft I Believe in regulation okay and that's the way in the regulation edit and that's the way I'm ready to go to overtime\nWe'd go to ... and when you get to overtime each team gets a possession and you're starting from the ... yard line\nOkay so gets in county central was lucky enough they won the toss and uh they got the ball first draft Peterson goes nine yards gets down to the one yard line on the first downplay ... and it took them a\nCouple of more downs but then again uh they were able to push it in again it was a Josh running though would push right through the metal gun in the end zone they missed the a to point conversion\nAnd a as a result they would take a twenty to sixty and lead\nInto jelly or north loans possession and killing or ... or they would come back and then we go to Bren Jordan a and bend Jordan and uh uh two plays he was getting now to the three are lying\nOn the third downplay they were able to get it to the one in Jordan looked like he was going to get to the end zone but a great defensive play in the far side but get some counties central mhm and they stop and at the one yard line so here we go\nIt's pointing to sixteen [laughter] for over our goal is the one he has to get even now they have to get in so what do they do they call a timeout a shower I alright ... about it they're going to end\nTo the time with some other time outs and uh their quarterback a billings or can't a was a gene Waldo is their quarterback and\nUh they decided to pitch it out and they're going to pitch it to the near side uh Jordan fumbled it yeah and he had by the time he got on the football or gets in Comedy Central is their tackled him back at the five yard line and our game\nWas over and over came over and over time it was a it was a it was a really entertaining football game and they take away the rain and everything and got brought a little bit more excited\nKelly was one of those teams are unknown because a way like we've we've talked to a number ties is one of the teams in section eight we don't get a chance ...\nYeah they they only play one section game all year he had some very difficult read on them or their schedule and they're curious had them in the two spots but there are a whole lot of questions about whether they belong there but if they took three team get to the federal the overtime they belonged to spy on them yeah I'm\nThe weather obviously was a made they made it interesting I guarantee one thing whether it will not be a factor on Thursday will not me [laughter] well not not the fertile\nLand you in that in mind doing the game it was it was a fun game is a very uh uh entertaining driving cars back when I was a kid we used to go fishing and wash Gish and we used to take\nThat road all Africa and they turned around and charisma or on the road and stuff when it's or note\nAnd you're driving but uh uh getting to the game once again I got to put a take my hand or to get some counties central\nWhen defense a colony or\nThey were there and they die and they deserve to go to the uh championships\nOr I Will say for Kelly or north all they've got a great running back coming back in and bend Jordan a carry the ball forty seven times for for\nA killer north all for how many hours I think he had a hundred and thirty seven yards I work we use the workhorse from yes and ah you know and it's too bad one team had to lose you know\nWell as I say it was okay because they are in that we've all back in the end it was alright ... I think ultimately we know we're going to the quarterfinals that that's true and ...\nAll right drew get basically appreciate it we let All right that's the other game that took place over the weekend so that does set up this week the a section titled game which is as we mentioned twelve thirty on Thursday\nSteven are galley kitchens central and again we'll be at the Fargo dome if at twelve thirty the first day game of the day's want coverage on the ...

[laughter] Sunday football [laughter]\nWe've got them back to our pre game shows in America [noise]\nLocked up real kick off with colon couch a box with it all starts at eleven I mean there [noise] [noise]\nWorks radio Thursday off the Oakland Raiders take on a San Francisco forty niners\nRaiders neither Thursday at seven thirty eastern on Fox now they\nHave\n\nHired as the ... for radio on this metal Monday I wear broad view of course by discover card because discover card streets you life you were ... were pleased\nTo bring in our right after the end of the world series Chris Rose host of intentional talk on M. L. V. network you can follow him on Twitter at ... at Chris Rose Chris welcome to the eye of the\nGood guy\nWe're great man we're great we look we both picked the Dodgers so we're not we we felt or were yeah we found on paper the red Sox best\nTo no doubt about it what did you know but you know where's the best team doesn't always ... ball\nRight we thought you know they might were AB their team of destiny in and they'll pull it out but and and we readily admit the Dodgers are armed sorry the red Sox are better but we were just talking about it I feel like the Dodgers\nAre hurt them like took themselves out of a chance to make it a series\nWith some of the moves they did based on the analytics you know taking rich still out I was taking Walker buell or out the game before\nYou know and and obviously that became an Eighteen any games like if we don't have to go into the batting lined up you know taking out their home run hitter like are we just dinosaurs and wrong or\nDo you think this is a situation where a lot of people might look at them versus the red Sox and how they use analytics and there could be a little bit of a sea change in major league baseball\n[noise] All right well let's let's be our first and foremost which is all thirty teams use adult let it\nRight and we're not saying don't use them into a different\nVarying degrees and you know I think some of the Roberts decisions were organizational meaning that way to go out and play it at the all if them scenario if the ACA that will be there\nAre also believe that some of it was cut and and the rest of the those are I think the rich heal thing was watch word got than analytics\nYou can say it was the wrong move and it actually it was\nBut I think that that was a managerial move and I do believe it state by ... am or tied much like a lot of bad actors are because they're getting the light of added by getting the if then scenario orange down there without\nAnd we're losing the touch and feel and the ability to look into a guy's eyes are I think that Alex ... actually made a bunch of brilliant moves\nAnd people will say well those were old school and if you're a little move\nMaybe but man I loved it that he brought in of all the dates wanted to write it with ... slammed the door shut\nA you know against the ... that he did it with David Price I mean the the price pitch starting games to buy came out of the opening game three of warmed up in game or\nI don't know how many teams are taking that chance right but he did it and it worked and it was a thing of beauty for Red Sox and read ...\n... what about the Clinton ... who are of course has an option to opt out ah the Dodgers could offer um you know a little bit more money ah a couple more years maybe four years\nA hundred million ... sixty five million do you expect him to opt out and a test the waters or stick around LA I Know a lot of Dodger fans don't want 'em right now but I Would give them up or do what do you think's gonna happen with him in Los Angeles\nSo he's got three days to do this um I Believe he will opt out I Believe he also will stay and I think he'll get a modest extension on top of the money that he's already old okay so\nIt's not going to be the Kobe Bryant let's just pile on thank you for everything you've got the ... because we know what that did the Lakers and hamstrung them for several years right um so the Dodgers have to be careful when I talk to people with great sit down interview with Ken Rosenthal during the\nCareful wife are crucial do great sit down interview with Ken Rosenthal during the ... she asked him about that one\nAnd Kuwait and we very proud\nAnd works extremely hard believes that he can regain ... off the off season\nWhere they fall off season of training to answer I Hope you can for his sake the author's sake if he remains LA\nAh I'm somewhat skeptical but he can because I just don't think guys get healthier and better at the age of thirty but there's a possibility and if so then the deal will work out fine because I think\nYou know some guys who have to re create um fly into looking terrible back in the eighties you went for our guy to Ninety eight I was growing up in the last few years it worked out for years we just had a crush on which we will\nFor the most ... power to have a ... to be an adult so we'll see how ...\n... on on a managerial sought if if you're the Dodgers okay you'd you'd expect ... to come back\nThey Roberts I mean some people say it's hard to blame the manager when he makes seven hundred thousand and Friedman a general manager make seven million who's making the calls here and if it's coming from upstairs a lot of good to know how can you blame\nRoberts ah I Know he's gone back to back World Series and his first three years you know he's been the one that division six years in a row it's not like they haven't competed and haven't had a chance or you see him as safe and just a business as usual as their chance that they could make a move\n[noise] well I got an option to pick up for a little more than a ... and we heard rumblings today to their own stature and\nDo the good that we are we we got back to that I don't know if we can ... you can call back when we could call you back real quick yeah we'll try try your back 'cause it's just we can't hear you yeah Charlotte's charm back\nReal quick but um I look I think with Dave Roberts he's got is a team option right they hadn't picked up you know they haven't picked up yet so obviously they were looking at this year as a tryout\nRob the way I see it as is only the Dodgers front office really seems to know how much making the decision on Thursday Robert's call right are we doing this and he's the far right so if if they're making the call\nOh and not starting your for top homerun hitters against lefty okay let's try the reactors back\nYet but not the guy that I think the Dodgers sabotage my own life but they didn't [laughter]\nI Do that when I Love the drop that knowledge day Roberts what this future with LA\nI think that I think he's okay but here's what I'd like to see in the future with\nWith so many teams focusing on on analytics and not taking the manager out of the equation but utilizing them at a totally different world than we had seen the previews fired you know now we haven't seen this five or ten years ago right right I Would like to see management come down and answer questions posed game as well I really want to\nThat is a great ... has a good point because they're planning\nI mean depending on how they use the analytics but if there are strictly analytic they are right there that manages the he's the one that takes the shots 'cause everybody's Ruben day Robert we saw him get boom by the fan I've said this is these are his decisions in my opinion my humble opinion\nHe should be fired right I'm Sorry like don't bring him back if he's making these decisions\nBut if it's Andrew Freedman in and the rest of the front office then I don't see how you can blame day Robert\nI'm with you your you know and here's the other point\nThat the term is called manager he's not a head coach okay so he's a manager people write for a hundred sixty two games\nYou after massage egos have you have to take care of personalities playing time guys that have instead of causes all that seemingly when you get the October that's when you start managing baseball games and it becomes the weirdest thing it really does because\nYou're ... and in the analytics world sometimes what works over a hundred and sixty two games this not work over seven game series right you have you have to look you have to have a gut you have to have a feel you have to use your eyes more frequently\nSometimes leaving a guy like Cody Belcher even though you're going to get the left he doesn't make sense because rap yoked Evers was elected editor for the red Sox was against quake Kirsch off thank you what like what's the difference your ballot your was your best defensive outfielder he's your best bass writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNa ve for one the falls well we're glad one of\nBad a ball of\nIs down there you're paying to be way oh man

town served in the national guard and as a teacher a football coach while raising a family man when Congress passed the farm bill working with the egg community to boost up all the way\nIt was always been with us now he's got a plan to revitalize or small towns and understand how important they are to Minnesota\nThat's why I'm supporting Tim Walz for governor and I hope you will to thank Brian I'm Tim Walz I'm running so everyone in every part of Minnesota has a voice in the chance to succeed that's what one Minnesota is all about [noise] about appreciate your vote for ... for governor members to report by Tim Walz for\nGovernor years and now he is retired out in Idaho but he has joined us because he's in town to talk about the boundary water Tom thanks a lot for a for stepping in here with me for a few minutes we'll thank\nYou for having me exciting to be here in town today to help to be part of a celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the boundary waters wilderness area\nYou know the reason I'm here is that why was chief for the U.S Forest Service had the opportunity to visit the boundary waters and spend time on the barrier national forest which manages the boundary waters wilderness area and to really get a sense for how special places and not how important it is just to folks from Minnesota\nBut how it is a national treasure for this country\nSo it's great to be here today to be able to help celebrate the anniversary of the folks that had the with them the foresight to set aside this area so that all Americans and especially those folks here in Minnesota they get to enjoy it more than most to have this special place that's been protected or through the wilderness act\nOr the ... that goes back to Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen Seventy eight oh that's one of the boundary waters is kind of formal answers Iran\nYes it was former light in Seventy eight ... but it actually goes back to Nineteen twenty six or in the forest service or working with the secretary of agriculture recognize the the significance of the special place and actually put provision in place back in back in twenty sick to be able to protect the place for development\nIt's a great chunk of property that I've ... I get up to every year you would have you spent some time I know you've flown over your checked it out 'til solve any experiences with northern Minnesota charm\nWell that's the time I spent upon the superior national for the first I did have a chance to fly across them it it's a very large area of the uh the opportunity to fly across the gave me the than for\nThe beauty of the play and why it's so special and part of it just died and then the thing that really stood out for me the amount of water this is the place that recreation fishing hunting just recreating it's all water ... yeah\nThe majority of the area is covered with standing water which makes it great for canoeing or any type of water based recreation and then also the wildlife habitat that that they're not just the fisheries but at the wildlife all the time to these species like comic place\nThat needs to be protected so when I first flew across that I just couldn't believe we had such a special place in the\nIn this country and then I had the time to get on on the ground and the other thing I wanted to stress about it is that before I had a chance to come here I'd heard about the boundary waters from my one of my rice relative that she grew up in Southern California okay\nAnd when I first got to know her I was talking with other relatives I asked what do you like to do and I said every year we'd go to the boundary waters wilderness area to go canoeing from from Los Angeles I'll be darned\nAnd they had found that special place and it was like all this guy would talk about it and so this guy would work year round and he would take his ... his limited vacation time indeed come to Minnesota to spend it there basically to renew his parents is the way he would talk about it so it gave me the early inside about how wonderful that's places\nI Believe the most visited wilderness in the country\nMost ... in the eastern United you know you have our own tree\nAnd when I'm In there I ... I was pumping to someone from far away and you bump into a lot of Minnesota there's a lot of people from Wisconsin but it seems like I was bumping to someone from Chicago or New York state for down south quite frequently and and it's like wow you you drove all the way up here or or maybe even flew into a camp in in our bomb you are supposed to be a pretty special place\nFor the special place in it and from folks that I've met here in Minnesota that seems like it either everyone has a cabin up there\nOr they want a cabin up there right at that kind of special place but it also as you point out people from all over the country and also it's getting to be known for around the world the special place\nWhich brings a lot of people into the area which really drives the recreation economy up there I think the last number that the forest service put together that annually that brings in about\nA forty four million dollars of economic activity to the area that supports a lot of job I'll tell you cannot just credit the economic activity is driven by the recreational at the tourism business owner\nAnd the time you were the director of the U.S Forest Service from there was a two thousand nine to twenty Seventeen yeah that's a nice Ron I'm part of\nDuring the U.S Forest Service from there was a two thousand nine to twenty Seventeen yeah that's a nice run them part of two presidents Jews from different parties so congratulations of her for writing that out so the till you're retired after what forty one years with the agency a\nRetired after forty one years and I was fortunate to\nSpend about half of my career or actually in the field and then if they moved into administration and then had the honor to be the chief of the forest service which is a unique position and federal agencies that's one of the few federal agencies where the the head of the ... of the agencies it ... the title is the chief\nIt's not a political position which I thought we spent a career so wary of somewhat unique in that way I Want to do a lot of federal agency\nThat's nice it's nice to hear the word politics removed from from the ... of a position that important\nOf course we've got some controversial with our Boehner waters here and the discussion of the potential for sulfide mining real within that watershed adjacent really right adjacent to it while you were the forest service director in twenty fourteen you decided what not to renew the leash for ah for one metals is is that correct of course the one that's been in the news a lot here lately\nWell the the twin metal leaders were first day shoot in Nineteen sixty six [noise] which was prior to any majority of the environmental laws that we have an effect in this country today\nAnd then the department of interior that does the league team and all federal lands mainly the they read new deletes a few times into and twenty four team that came up again for renewable\nAnd so they are the ... apartment adventure asked do you want to come down to renewing asleep so we took a look at it and it wasn't just a quick decision and I I Will admit that when I first flew over this country and was out on the ground\nIt raised a lot of serious questions with me about how you could mine even an underground mine how you could actually pull that off with so much of the surface covered by water right and then of course the concern\nWith the sulfide or so I asked our um specialist are mining engineers are scientists to take a hard look at the end it really look at some of the the potential risk for this and what they determined without any question that trying to do 'em to mind is type or the sulfide type or\nAnd especially in an area where there's so much water on the surface that would just be very very problematic and we have a very high risk of impacting our water quality\nAnd you've got to understand that when you release sulfide or to you the air or to water it creates a ferry captain right at a minimum it increases the ph in the water which has a deadly effect you know for fisheries so based on that and all the research and science that we put together we became very concerned in addition we held a couple of public meeting\nWhere at the staff up here to sit down with local people and talk to them about it\nAnd yet there are strong proponents for mining there's strong opponent to Miami but at the end of the day we let science you know guide our decision and based on that I declined to consent\nTo renewing delete them and that's what we did them one of the when I was still the chief for the U.S Forest Service and I can't stress enough that that was based on the science and the knowledge that we have our scientists and our specialist looked at other types of the type of mining throughout the country\nLooked at some of the risk and potential impacts of they had and without any question the decision whether to not consent\nNo time we've heard opponents say this has never been done successfully anywhere else in this kind of water rich environment something you know I'm kind of paraphrasing but is that is that a sentiment you agree with our warehouse ... sulfide copper sulfide mining work\nWell we have every place you have a large mining operation there's going to be impacts sure ... air retrieval commitment of the resource that together but I have worked with a mining and personally in Nevada with gold mining and then also in Arizona where the forest service out\nAt several large copper mine that are on the national forest and they are very controversial without any question but in the very dry environment where you you don't have a lot of water um\nThey're able to actually have an operating minded does not impact the water quality now there's always

of these guys with his ... going to have\nHim I\nAnd so when I was ... when I Do the voice of just kind of do that and I would get I Would be doing it sort of the get into character to get the voice

that I remember I used to be a musician and um\nI played with Sam Myers and there was this guy from the Santa Barbara blues society there and he was interviewing Sam said this way of talking he said

least one of our teams go there for sure and I don't know if they'll bring a team out of New York or tried to bring two teams from our like I I Would like to see and bring two teams from our lake because they're trying to get in our legs so bad\n[noise] be a long way to go to go to jail for a regular season game ball brutal not bad for Rochester that well maybe it's a great for them you know like for them it is really from here yeah it is and\nThat'll make it different what about healthier club where are you there right now\nAll we have a few injuries uh Ryan Erickson a de Lima in may or may not play a lot of demand so our one offensive lineman is out but it's nothing that we haven't one or two injuries for this I think we're ... a former healthier than we were a year ago\nAnd some of those guys have been out for a little while yeah got to have to adjust already in those positions as well yeah the only new injury is Ryan so ultimately\nThis comes down to you being able to mix and match or off when you get down an and throw your ...\nOh yeah and uh they give us some looks that we think we can take advantage of that if we can run the ball or they'll have a very very hard time stopping us so the key is than protecting the ball and scoring on those drives\nBut for folks who like passing I you're going to see a ton of it on Sunday all had between Olson and Devon area you're going to see you guys go get the global\nPack a lunch she'll be about a hundred and Ninety place [laughter]\nEnd about four and a half hours yeah I I I exactly it it's going to be it's going to be a link you won't be ... things are going to throw it will try to make sure you're home for the NFL night game oh gee things appreciate that ultimately kickoff is one thirty right and uh when put you at home again next Sunday\nThat is correct or against the lower seat of the other division there's no way we'll play central lake sat around us in central lakes of the ... the number one seeds if we when we pull play lower seeds so if we get lucky and when are we would get the winner of massage the range in a task\nWhich is possible they could be I'd ask you if you just played at the end\nFor a task is probably the best team in these soy that'll that'll make for an interesting time to 'cause it's a a chance to a rematch that over time but\nDon't forget the Minnesota west blew out central lakes early on the\nRate so there's less of a team and you got to the right to work they have some athletes they really do you're gonna have to get by tomorrow for certain threat to the ultimately I down the road and that would also be Sunday at one third grade\nAnd then two weeks from today is the state file or three it'd be of disarray there's three rounds right will be two weeks from two weeks from tomorrow Oh yes yes yes you're right and that would be I think like I said if you get there again that is correct so and so that the target right now at the end\nThere is I saw no there is one change and that they have another conflict at St Cloud state so the championship game on that Sunday will kick off at noon not one\nThirty a little bit earlier yeah but uh but that's the target that's the goal\nIs why we stopped there on the way to ah ah we practiced in Saint cloud on the way to Rochester\nAs far as your club goes how's attitude a house or is everything along those lines going into tomorrow\nGetting we're getting there and you know it's a they're all freshmen sophomores or so it's ... but the world playing freshman sophomore so we're all in the same\nBoat the fog list for you for all down into practice there is going to be an interesting ...\nIt is a well that's a light practice so won't be bad but yeah it's a it's a foggy after\nOne other thing that has been a concern\nA off and on during the year this year at times you're special teams especially kicked coverage punk coverage has not been where you'd like\nTo be all not even close not even close now we've returned to catch for touchdowns but on the other hand we've given up too much uh we work every day on squid kicks we work on the ball out of bounds we work on all that stuff and for whatever reason we get in the game and we we can't seem to accomplish that\nBut it but when you give up those short field the kind of puts ... well that is all\nLast week we get a between because they're great athletes returned kicks every time we score they got the ball at midfielder less so they really had we probably gave up Eighteen points in our kickoff team\nAnd that and that ultimately is a is a huge factor for you but you know a playoff time exactly 'cause you don't get as many opportunities cause games closer goats I Know you've got things we do to prepare for practice a thanks for coming in first thing was warning I Will talk to you but what again tomorrow I think he's looking forward to it I just got to go to another ... football\nProgram this morning and they play on thirty tomorrow afternoon against

thousand fever falls and keep your vehicle in top condition\n[noise]\nWe can\nNow we'll continue talking football and wrap up the probably the football season was kind of hoping we'd be talking about going somewhere to play today but uh unfortunately that didn't happen and really coach earlier this week in the first round playoff game more of the same just really struggled support points on points on the board you\nUp and that's been an issue obviously all year um you know and it was a it was a tough started again to you know we go three and now I've had our defense in it and I think I think they might even block to ponder tip the ... so they William I'm you know they're at the fifty but I think it took\nTo ponder kept the ... so that we give them um you know they're at the fifty but I think it took for it took them ten or twelve plays discourse or you know defense that was kind of happy at least with that drive you made 'em earn it\nUm we stuffed them on the the PAT which we practiced a lot they did this one gate and we adjusted and I was proud of the kids with that then the next possession we former right away and then they scores or you know we run for office supplies and we're down twelve nothing and you've seen us all year Wayne and it's been a we need something positive happen early and unfortunately we just didn't get it\nWas one that type of thing happens that quickly in a game and you have the kind of year you had a it's really easy for the kids I don't want us to give up but just lose that intently ...\nWell it is you know and even that you know at halftime or down twenty four nothing in his guys it's three scores and\nUm you know we're still in this thing but when you haven't put points on the board unfortunately you know that that that doubt cups sneaks in and you know I was proud of our guys effort and um you know they play their hearts out like you said you know they didn't quit but you know in the back of the mind when that happens it's it's it's it's an it's an uphill battle in you know unfortunately we couldn't get her done\nOn the off the side of the football I'm Talking about returns now most of your quote unquote skill kids come back\nTo your quarterback or grand Hartman will be back a coal Johnson will be back it running back ah Brigham in in ... and with the exception of miles and the and the time most of your receiving corps or the guys that are the regulars out there will be back\nSo that puts you just a Scotia head of the game because most of those kids didn't have any real varsity experience from a year\nAgo absolutely you know any experience that you get is important and um you know we look forward to those guys and um you know obviously you're gonna miss the seniors I'm\nYou know or it was a tough season for them but um you know at the same time they learn a lot of life lessons in and you know so then we move forward in a ... it was a is a great group of kids you know we love each each and every one of them individually and and we wish them the best next year to\nThe other end of the coin of the off in the front and really the defensive for us as well for the most part was upper class\nSo you don't have a whole lot of experience back there for next year and with the exception of baby holes and wonder if maybe one of the ... the ... missing in my mind uh you don't have a lot of science coming back either\nRight and that's that's part of that you know that's um we've got two main things we need to work on a and I think next year and one's obviously the weight room and that's you know we've got a great bunch of ah fresh bending the R C squad the freshman she see teams did freshman sophomore see Scott did really well\nAnd so um this year and and you know they're going to have to we're not some freshmen playing next year so that'll be an important thing some some some sophomores one yeah yeah yeah that's what I mean yeah this year's fresher\nSaid I think like friday did today and he goes yeah you know I said again and then kind of went who come out of work but okay and then um I said well we do host conference next year so you we will have to meet next year it just won't be ...\nUnfortunately from your own kids standpoint although a couple of kids ran in good times uh nobody qualified this year I\nAm nobody qualified um you know it was a bath course after that boy because the boys rates versus the ... and even ... years I'm\nSo last year the last one getting into state was Seventeen forty was cut off this year it was Seventeen Nineteen and when that when that lasts for ... or cross the finish line to get into the I was like\nThat was a fast pace that all those kids even in the mud like back in those words like it was black and they had to really um be careful with their footing back there and so I was worried even coming out of the trees towards the river\nI'm back there um before you hit the the river area or whatever it's it's really really really money over the air it was really money and I was worried about the footing and\nYou know how would affect times but it didn't affect times times are\nFantastic and so the with that you know we gave ... with the new Jack Davis who said you know you're going to have to probably be at then I'm Seventeen forty area and he was Seventeen fifty nine which is an amazing time for him you know from last year this year he cut\nA minute ten off and that's how we can ask each year to get\nYou know a little bit better and so he did an amazing job all year just cutting time cutting time cutting time and he that's the fastest Caesar and that of course and so we're proud of him for doing that and\nYou know I was looking as I was sitting here just back at the times for the teams and\nOur our team all of them um the from from the we are from there appear to Seventeen to Eighteen they've all cuts so much time and a half like Jonah Carlson is\nHe kinda on nearly two minutes from last year either ... or like our top five where are you losing ... an urban chases the calcium that's it and\nWe were going to be even better next year and so I'm excited for next year and I'm excited for where the kids are we ... we bought it brought up right in line on and so he's a seventh grader and he ran really well and [noise] so\nHe's a seventh grader and he ran really well and so yeah so next year the gun and then on the girls side we lose to seniors that we get some ain't going I'm rest the Americans and so we'll have to replace them but\nYou know ... been a great leader so will miss her in that aspect so we need to find um another great leader um to step up and knew that also but the girls team also we have we have a good top five um that it will be able to run and maybe we can bring up some of those um\nSome of those girls who were in sixth grade maybe or in seventh grade that are you know you know when you're younger ... you're a little bit faster you know ... on the girls that I Do tend to progress when you're at a younger age than when you're a boy so our boys should progress as they are getting older and are girls um\nYeah so I don't know it's been a good year\nFast and what by pretty good ... dead yeah it did\nAnd I yeah I'm thankful I'm Lisa ... our assistant coach has been amazing all year and then we had Paul Brand as a junior high coach and he did a great job all year too so I'm just thankful and then thankful for everybody that came out on Thursday and helped us because we couldn't have done it without them\nNot cooperate directed at spring right yeah I ... in the spring you know when we have the coaches meaning on Thursday one of the coach's raise their hand or Cory and he's like\nYou got a lot of flags out there where there's nobody in the you know kids are going to cut corners I Know we've got forty seven people that are going to be out there by the flags so there will be no cutting corners so it was good to have all those Ontario so we're thankful that they all came out\nAnd then now if you can get kids out so they're so they're running a gym is ringing not relaxing in the spring that much better\nYeah in summer you know you can't just go into the season in August and expect to do well I'm Jonah and eat them and Jake they all work during the summer and worked hard during the summer and you can't go in and Isaac ... you can't go in and expect to do well in the season if you're not running in the summer\nWell thanks for spending time with us again on Saturday and the good to see your daughter once in a while she's over there having a good time again and I'm looking forward to starting next year when are we think\nYeah and thank you for everything that you do for us to and I'm Glad the sections came off well despite the

your final game of the regular season today coach\nYeah and sophomore days are pretty excited about today's event\nWell let's let's talk a little bit first of all about the about this last week you went over to the lake region to play last weekend yep and played some a scholarship schools yeah and it didn't go as well as it is the first time you're over there this year\nYeah you know as a team to go on they get the you know and prove they get faster they get harder\nHeading there often says beat up and I think it was a little bit of an adjustment over there with some of these due to schools in regards to they're often to schemes I think our defense we took just a second in the blocking category to you know just those faster balls\nTaller girls adjusting some of those you know where we usually loosen up on defense and we're not dug down ready to dig that hard driven ball\nWay to get used to step in that hole in the block and ... you know taking some of the heat up the ball but it just it nicely in\nGame ... game four of the day that Saturday Saturday they came back down to it and when the next three and five so that was nice [noise]\nCame out yesterday and put your second last conference game how things go\nWe ended up I'm meeting having three they have some nice girls that can really put the ball down but are serving aggressive keeping them out our system you know that's usually one of our first things first and foremost things as a ... of serving games to make sure I blockers you know take a little off of them [noise]\nAnd and then today the last game as you said at sophomore day that's always a little emotional because you've got a handful of those is here\nYeah we have four of 'em actually in ... and ... from ... from the folding and rented a longer up from ... so it'll be fun for nice cocoa girls that are just hardworking and great energy in the gym\nAnd and kids but they aren't although at this level you're replacing constantly they're not going to be easy to replace because quite frankly two of them are your top two Saturdays so you're going to have to say look we're for next year\nYeah definitely you know and but one of the good thing because we have also have my hands and then there so um those too inbred on hand I have a nice role models and leaders for her I'm kind of kind of teaching some of the decision making and just that\nThat that grit to that goal for everything hard work ethic is just nice safe\nAnd are you in both cases particularly in Brennan's case but in both cases with those two kids the kids do Kim twenty two there has ...\nAre you okay with the with the progress so far\nOh yeah absolutely um each here's different as you know each group is different as you know and and with this ... this year as a group you know half the guys are\nExcellent great basketball IQs they aren't they grasp things quickly they remember things right away and the other half ... not so much is probably the biggest gap between one half of the team and the other that I've ever had and and so the struggle is\nThat the ... the guys that get it All right away want to move on their chomping at the bit already what's next what's next and then the other half\nIs so still so far behind their they're not grasping the basics yet they're not taking it into the competitions yet it's not that they're defiance it's not that at all they're all great kids they just aren't catching on and so\nThe challenge for me and practices how much time do we spend ... teaching and how much time do we move on to basically competing and getting to the next getting the finer details I end up\nOne some of those cases I no not at all but in some of those cases kids who maybe don't have the necessary basketball like you are you in the given sports or that comes from the systems they play piano\nAnd sometimes and those systems they just kind of give drove through the bottom of the foreign say go get them because I've got five kids who can do\nYeah and that's kind of what it is this year with these guys you know the guys that are\nI've got a lot of talent we're we're young team but we are talented probably top to bottom I'm you know maybe one of my better talent groups um\nAnd so these these guys that are struggling with the system and learning how to play at our level they all of them played in systems where they were extremely athletic and they could do some things in the end you're right the coach didn't have to didn't feel he had to do a lot with them and he just let them play and\nAnd as you know that doesn't fly in college and um they're learning where there's been some real noticeable improvements finally this past week but with them and I just everybody there's we're still in progress I work in progress and we've got a ways to go\nNow over the years you had both ends of the coin as far as kids coming from the football program into the basketball program wants football is over some years you've had come get him in that were big contributors for you and other years you've had some kids come in they just never really caught up in um\nHow many kids from there because there's a bunch of athletes on that team do are you expecting this year\nNone of 'em were were everybody's predicting that are football program football team will advance fairly far into the playoffs again this year last year they got to the ultimate end where they were in a bowl game in December and\nThat kind of put the ... the guy\nAnd there was three guys that would've helped us off of that football team that came\nTo practice once they got done and then a week and a half later everybody's going home for Christmas break they they had already made their travel plans to come back two and a half weeks after my guys are all coming back so it just never worked out and so this year you know we just kinda\n... honestly we had a couple of guys ask us and I just said it's just not going to work you know you guys get so far behind and why they do get by and it's and it's just almost impossible to catch up because of our system\nBecause with your early just team workouts I and ah with with the open practice schedule actually starting a little earlier now than it used to seeing all the college level by very good a good month oh All right now right probably more like six seven weeks yeah\nYou're exactly right and no matter how much experience they had in basketball in high school I'm sure it wasn't the same as what we're doing here and and so it's even it's even more difficult because of that so when do we go for real ... is our first game um that's a week I Know a week from Monday\nIt said maybe it'll against their ... and uh\nAnd then we're off and running\nAnd from their ... slow down till mid February\nRight yup it's um you know I've I've I I I adjusted our schedule a little bit this year\nTo the point because I knew were going to be really young and we're not in the lake region tournament this year we're playing a couple of more JV teams and then we've had we've added a team into our conference with Lake Superior college in Duluth adding basketball\nAnd so we lost two non conference games there\nAnd so we've got a little bit more time in the fall here we've got a little bit more time between game which might be okay it is you absolutely we instead of playing games every three or four days now we play on a Monday we got a week to prepare we play on the next Tuesday we got five days to prepare we play on a\nFriday or whatever Saturday or whatever it is and\nAnd again part of that was delivered knowing that we're going to be really young\nI I Know it it's way too early yet to project lineups and project the rotation so on and so forth but the other tough thing for you and for fans listening used to work through the road\nThe thing for you and for fans listening used to work through the rotation because you're dealing with Fifteen guys right now the majority of whom played significant minutes advised school level well the truth is you're only going to play\nSignificant minutes wise nine maybe nine or ten you know ... and the other five or six are going to see minimum at its best at how they handle that matters to\nThat's the ... that's one of the main issues every single year\nUnless I unless we're able to get guys off the high school teams that were role players that were\nWere good enough as role players to contribute to us and there used to that we're always going to have the the that struggle and we're and we're actually dealing with it right now we have a couple of guys that are really unhappy and because of that fact that they were started in high school and now they're not\nRight now anyway they're not in the main rotation and they're and they're having a difficult time with that and I do understand that but I Know that we're gonna we're probably going to lose one or two of these guys and we'll be down to Thirteen\nAnd it's not necessarily a cutting of the herd you'll know it happened\nIt's just what happens is not intentional on our part it's just the fact that some guys can handle that change in their role\nI Know when I was at the at the for your level and and working as a student assistant you've read these stories before but uh [noise] that was one of the big things for me as a student assistant was a sit down with it and say hey look you got to be patient gradients WorldCom yeah it's just a matter of are you ready when you were African re does ... right\nAnd that we've and we've talked we talked about that from day one that the concept of being patient don't let October November taint your mind and change your attitude just keep plugging away because things in December and January are not going to be the same as they are in October\nAnd November gray gray ... whole bunch of stuff that happened right\nBut again you can talk all you want to so young men and bought that type of stuff but yet patience with some of them is just not really in their make up\nWell there's always I'm looking forward to the season the north and find her basketball's always one of the highlights of the year in and day\nYou'd start soon enough

Scott Peterson we've explored many facets of the opioid crisis in Minnesota over the course of the last several\nMonths today we're looking at the impact the epidemic is having on rural Minnesota I chatted with Ruth merit director of the Minnesota Farm Bureau foundation about the effects of opioids on farm country\nRural America is being impacted a we have actually even come up to the levels and surpassed the impacts that are happening in our urban areas\nSo that's a concern for the Minnesota Farm Bureau so we feel that it's really important to get out and talk about the issue find out what's going on it from a from a a a legislative standpoint from a the kind of what's happening with health officials\nEverybody's having a conversation with and they're owned apartments and their own areas but we feel that needs to be a bigger conversation with more players and the community so that's really what we're striving to\nKill me Ruth what do we know about why those numbers are increasing in in some cases surpassing in rural areas what's happening in urban areas\nWell in it and they'll remember we're talking about opiates so you know there's lots of different drugs and drugs that are being abused out there\nWhen we specifically talk about opiates um some of the reason is is that you know farmers will get injured hum the prescribe are often times has prescribed more than the needed amount and that dependency on that Dr happens rap you know quickly\nSo rather than um take time to go in for physical therapy or take time to really healed from an injury\nWhat what happens is they just pop another pill and then eventually that dependency happens so think of a farmer you know not often does he you know he wants to leave out farm you know that that crop needs to be harvested outside of the needs to be done in this amount of time I got this ... I don't have time\nTo heal my body or to go into that physical therapy I'm just going to take this path then that dependency happens and often times at the at the hidden problem\nThere is not resources available to the ... the individual\nTo um take care of his his dependency we don't have the treatment facilities in our rural areas oftentimes they have to drive\nA long ways to find a treatment facility or even just get medical help and so we think that those are some of the reasons that this is happening we we're not exactly sure and that's why these conversations and need to be happening\nUm the American Farm Bureau did a survey with morning consult\nAnd we found out that through that and this was a national survey that specifically targeted farmers and ranchers across the United states is that forty five percent of all farmers have been directly impacted by the opioid crisis\nAnd that's a staggering statistic Seventy four percent of farmers and farm workers um they've been directly impacted by the opiate epidemic so that's three and four farmers so we know that we need to be doing work in our real communities\nUm the other statistic that just really jumped out at me was that three and four farmers say it's easy to access large amounts of opiates um without a prescription what that's telling me is that people are leaving unused opioids and their medicine cabinets\n'em or you know in in some cases kitchen coverage or wherever\nAnd they're saving it for a rainy day they're saving up for that time that they don't have time to run in\nFor that nice brainer that ankle spraying or when they might need an a of a pain killer and they're accessing those unused prescription and their medicine cabinet and the state of Minnesota there were over three million prescriptions written\nUm and in terms of and that was in two dollars and Fifteen cents I think you know we're in two thousand Eighteen so\nHow many of those prescriptions that are left on use and that's a big part of what we're doing here and Farm Bureau is that we're distributing we received a grant through\nA partnership with ... and where we're working with a group called a plan to get the message out let people know about resources available to them um by using a website called farm town strong dot org again farm town strong doubt dot org\nAnd also we're distributing um deterrent drug cats\nAh we've given out about five thousand we have another five thousand to um safely dispose of prescription drugs that are in medicine cabinet\nThere are drop off points but not everybody has access to those dropout points maybe those drop off our during certain hours and or on certain days and that opportunity to go in and dispose or those prescription drugs may not be available over well\nIt go in and dispose or those prescription drugs may not be available over well for the real farm family that may have unused prescription\nYou know you mentioned a little bit earlier the hidden nature of the problem and I imagine the one of the aspects of that and one of the challenges is the stigma associated with it would probably make it somewhat difficult for some people to come forward and say that they need help\nUh in in I don't want to generalize too much but I Would certainly anticipate that that would also be the case with farmers is that what you find\nAbsolutely I'm In one of the things that was pointed out in the um research that we saw was that sixty eight percent of Americans and and believe that increasing public relations\nI which we're we're doing here at former we're trying to make that ah that public relations happened that those conversations but also reducing the shame and stigma are key to solving the opiate crisis I'm you or not you know farmers by nature\nUm have a reputation of being a strong and resilient and\nThat perception sometimes has hurt us they had one we want to maintain that were afraid that they're of that stigma of walking in to a recovery center to walk into a doctor's office and oftentimes even than to our loved ones I have an addiction problem\nSo the more that we can talk about it the more that we can reduce the stigma um it is an incredible disease that is really taking over and it's heartbreaking\nI'm In if you look at the opiate overdoses and kind of look at the numbers are we have a growing problem we are not going to you know or can we are not\nGoing to a raft our way out of this crisis is happening in our rural communities\nHere is the most popular Minnesota athlete out of the book um what's her name\nElse\nNo

about if you're listening to us in you're in a you know South Carolina you don't have to take your head or you're listening to us in Connecticut probably a good idea that disconnect\nThough yes ... disconnected my point is don't put it away why is that because we need water\nIf you do get rain fall right up until a holiday season especially newly planted trees and shrubs and evergreens at the top of the list mother nature's in and take care of me Ron we hope so but you don't know that she leaves\nThe host the two last tools I find a way to know everything\nYou do the most part you know why

either one of those plants in or water ever reach if Mother Nature doesn't come through\nBut I'd has issued disconnected from the faucet because there are some nights it get below freezing\nAnd and

and all yeah\nNo\nYeah we're we're watching all this MBA and oh yeah we got the world series going on what made it\nYeah we're we're watching all this MBA and oh yeah we got the world series going on what made it so difficult this week for me is that I Know I'm late to the party on this folks but on Tuesday my daughter a installed the fire stick on my TV so for the first time in my life\nI have Netflix so imagine if you go it's the first week here on Netflix one night I'm watching it on one forty free one forty two Lakers you know if that's what I'm trying to watch what brought I'm trying to watch you know football and trying to watch the world series\nAnd I'm trying to get started with Netflix so the first show I started with is Ozark\nSo I'm I got I'm getting through the first season you know I go one I didn't realize they get like three seconds I the episode is like ... and the ... now I guess that's why the hell do you get hooked on your is this for thirty in the morning right and then all of a sudden you're all hook\nThat they'll come binge watching what you're talking right and I bought a new vocabulary and I also I also know or Netflix and chill I also found that one out in my twenty two year old son I'm\nAll right so I'm All right I'm gonna I'm gonna try to zip through Ozark which is it now its second season so I got to get season one season to where should I go next now I've never seen Breaking Bad try go back in and go through the whole runner Breaking Bad I Am\nI was like you in that I did not watch Breaking Bad while it was right aired we watched it in a binge fashion and it was worth every\nMinute alright so binge of Breaking Bad I saw Mad Men so I I I did watch that series when it was out what else am I going to\nGet into a stranger things is that ranger things everyone keeps talking about is that um us as well Oh yes ... especially the leaders of of that or is there being two seasons okay released around Halloween\nI don't know where the third one yeah and there's a new um an additional episodes of ah making of a murder\nSo he doesn't want every one of ... one of the attorneys I Do have to say what are the attorneys on the case or my sister worked for in Milwaukee but the problem is there's only so many hours in fact we're still having days a week\nAnd they're in the ... and and that's why you have to determine Breaking Bad was what guy six seasons yes as you said you've got your on Ozark and that is\nToo I I did go out and I get maybe\nTwo to three episodes a night that top sit circus at least a month to do break right right and so that's maybe why it's better to see if you were to start out with the ... that may have one or two seats well that's why you had to wear those are because I knew I it's you know so I'm a I'm a I'm going to get through that and then uh so I mean it's just it's\nMind boggling but on top of that oh it's been going on right now we haven't even talked to any NFL today than I got to get to some NFL I mean the NFL weeks or\nYou know it's the the good news for the NFL is your ratings are up\nAnd a lot of people could say there's a couple of reasons for that there are a couple of reasons one scoring is up and that's good for two reasons one it means that your fantasy football teams are scored more points than ever so that's exciting\nAnd also the fact that we have expanded legalized gambling in this country is making more and more people watch the national football league they put out a a a little report on the amount of revenue that each of the four major team sports in this country will generate in a single year based on\nLegalized gambling the NFL checked Senate additional two points three billion annual to point three billion annual so when you have that serious money on the line yeah a lot more people are actually watching the national football league\nConnection of football and because of the fewer opportunities for games also allows you to think that you know a lot more than they can like you never know what's gonna happen you know if you're on the second out of a back to back on an MBA night you know the other team's gonna show up right may maybe you'd be wary of it\nIn baseball the tough enough with allied anyway because it's just difficult plus if there's a number for starter you don't know what they're gonna start bull pending\nFootball though like a lot of us we feel that we know football that were connected to it and so you have the feeling of wanting to dive in and would have a better opportunity of cashing in on your own knowledge and that's what I think football but\nWhether it be the NFL or even of college but really more so of the national football league\nI'm looking at the odds I I go to a site that just sort of a consensus Vegas odds and it's always interesting to me uh watching\nNFL line they move dramatically when I say dramatically more than a point I mean some of the lines have really moved this week for instance um Cincinnati is hosting Tampa Bay the bucks have no defense\nI was on the bangles bandwagon in fact I thought bangles plus six at Kansas City was not a bad play [laughter] forty five dead by the way the air al Michaels slip it in the number is ... so Sunday night game\nForty five to ten the score and al Michaels who is obviously a guy that knows plenty about gambling 'cause he's constantly throwing outlines and everything else did this\nVery discreetly by the way he said it's forty five to ten he goes I Would imagine it was on it I Would imagine the number fifty six and a half is on the minds of a lot of people [laughter] that was the over under on that game I couldn't even imagine the chief score forty five but I mean look on this line here so Cincinnati\nIs hosting Tampa Bay the wide open with Cincinnati minus six now the consensus is mine is three\nAnd a half that's a lot of money going down on him by as a dog at since ...\nI've said Steve for weeks that of just pure titans and wide receivers Tampa Bay has the best collection of pass catchers\nIn the national foot L look in the yard it's Winston putting up every now and it's not ... and it's if you look back to last year there were a couple of stinkers but otherwise you was hovering around that\nThree hundred yard barrier that give or take twenty yards on on both ends and Steve\nIt's a team that doesn't have a consistent running game so you put a bad defense or the team they can't run the ball you know that he's got targets whether it's big place with Sean Jackson or big targets in Mike Evans and OJ Howard\nHampers really good through the air and I think that's why you're seeing what you're seeing with that game it's just because you know Tampa is going to be able to put up ... points it doesn't matter they can't stop anybody they're often says at least going to be able to score and maybe she said that he's run game won't be able to\nTurn up the clock as much against the Tampa Bay team it'll be\nA tight I got three more games the over under on that game by the way the over under right now consensus is fifty four and a half\nOkay that's a big now that little meaty All right here's another line that his move dramatically there's actually a number of this week I've been I watch this a lot and I've never seen a week where there's been more big moose or tour and more point line moves from the initial moved to where they are now another game\nIn the at the raiders\n... dance is open as a pet come\nNow India's a three point favorite at Oakland the thinking obviously is the raiders of just throwing in the town you know I'm Ari Cooper you're thinking that they have lost that it wasn't like Mark Cooper was putting a ban big number no and Martian Lynch placed uninsured reserve high so there's another game here's another one you ready for this this one this is\nA week as long as he doesn't know he's going to start if he doesn't have time to think about it he's fine for a week but then when he knows he's got his start the next week forget it\nThe guy's a metal gate the man went\nIn my car between ... pm eastern Yemen Fox ... all of the NBA is ah\nTo me the most type season ever [laughter] thank you for [noise] are you in because we are\nYou have to raise it to make do with [noise] and\nAnd you can keep it here as we cover this new seats on on on the hog Fox Sports radio\nBut so is your Sunday with Fox NFL kickoff joined some of football's Tom opinion makers as they provide unique perspective and expert analysis we ... am eastern on Fox Channel Fox Sports\n\nThe ... by er

a five percent savings in store an on line\nSubject to credit approval cannot be combined with other credit offers exclusion supplies the store for details\nUs only uh we've been flying through the Saturday but I can I can sense the anticipation from Dan by it's been a while so yes it's that time [laughter]\nThe high ...\nSpend up to now I don't know a whole lot of listeners know this but I have a Heisman vote insurers to go out there that with a lot of [noise]\nI I Will say this there are a lot of people that I have a high from both yeah if it came down to one vote he's the one that probably should have it like the ice but voters was just I just been voter it probably should be department there are a lot of people that shouldn't have Heisman votes you should have I well I I look at it this\nWay is a passion of mine I Know everything about the history of the Heisman fact I was back in New York last summer with my\nBoys went to the Heisman headquarters and\nUh started rattling up stuff and they looked at me like [noise]\nAll right this then can we get this man out of the building right now nobody should take the Heisman as seriously as you do and that was from the Heisman people need to get a vote I you know I don't know how I got my vote because I got my vote\nBack in twenty ten I actually made a call to the Heisman headquarters Heisman trust\nAnd I was actually telling them I've done a lot of\nStatistical research that I thought they might one for the arc that wasn't looking for money or there's like I've done all this work you might be interesting because they didn't seem all that interested in what they did ask me do you have a Heisman wrote I said no and I said has happened well\nEach other states there's eight hundred and Seventy media members it never changes eight hundred and Seventy needy members six different districts hundred and forty five votes each and there's a certain distribution by state each state as a representative of the states in charge of the hope\nVoters so you go on a waiting list of all I said well how do you lose your vote two ways either you leave the state that you're voting in or you die [noise]\nThose are the only way I was probably you know I get on the list now I didn't know the guy that was sort of running the LA the California show and I said well I mean I could be on this list forever\nHe goes I Know but\nAll of a sudden he gives me a call a couple of months later\nI got good news for you to stay there is a vote available and shoot you the top of the list\nI'm like who died he goes he didn't die but pat hate and just became the athletic director USC and head or fit his boss\nWhen you're outliving director of the university so I took over pat Hayden's voting twenty and [noise] and I'm proud of happy and that's a victory for UCLA in itself and by the way I look at it and why ... pattern a couple of years after that and thank him for\nTaking that job either so that's how I have a high speed boats so each week I give you my three two one I don't go beyond that 'cause my final ballot only has three spots on it\nWhere do I stand this is true last week's games here as my current number three Haskins is going to\nRoll back the fifty looking fires middle of field\nGoing be from a corner they\nIn a car and in a fight for the phone\nOn a corner you one yard pass court asking summit foreign\nHigh it's very difficult for a guy to hang onto a top three spot when your team just got walloped forty nine to twenty by the way that courtesy of the aisle Ohio State I Am the network but\nWhen you look at Haskins numbers four hundred and Seventy yards passing two touchdowns only one pick he leads the nation in passing yards he leads the nation in touch down fats [noise]\nSo your guy Dwayne Haskins is still hang it on my balance\nThey've got weapons that there is a gather they've just\nThat's good news is still hanging on my ballot\nThey got weapons that there is a gathering they've just lost Austin Mac like good for the rest of the regular season\nBut they've got four other guys that are dangerous threats in the past the game and we just talked about the buccaneers last segment was beats a little similar to the fact that they can't run the ball right now in the defense just acceptable but giving up yards at the place which allows Dwayne Haskins to get you to pass\nUp quarterback he's more talented than brags Millard ... or ... Jones as a path yeah yeah and I was more talented way more high so Dwayne Haskins is my current number three here's my current number two [noise]\nTwenty five thirty one hurry to get around it sounds\nOn to try to make it a seven point\nLead role in from all airfield where the call Tyler murdering another brilliant game two hundred and thirty are expensive for touchdowns nope back twenty five touchdowns on the air just three picks he's also run for corn and twenty yards by touchdowns remember this is it for him is college football career ends this year\nHe will then move on to his full time baseball career won't even come back for a senior at Oklahoma\nMove and hey joined an aids organization that could be in the postseason for the next few years\nI mean he's like Charlie Ward was you know Charlie war was a runaway Heisman winner never even thought about the NFL went straight to the NBA at a solid\nTen year career in the NBA just to Marjah remembered great yesterday and wide receiver ends up being a picture of the big like All right so we got Haskins that three Maria too I Wonder who's that number one here now on the snap rolling writers to off a ... or the end zone\n\nHe like gold just calls him by his first name at the goal from Larry field we now know his name and damned buyer just brought this up to me [noise]\nTongues via law [noise]\nTong go buy a lower [noise] All right do we have the clip but here\nFor the last ... you can come all vinyl hung for aids oh we lost [noise]\nAll right so that's to pronouncing his own name so even though it's spelled had go by law it's actually Congo\nViolent there it is a tongue up by law so I was in this way it was sort of like when Matt Weiner won the Heisman and he was introduced as Matt Weiner hard\nAnd I'm like Asian his name is Ellie I. N. A. R. T. Matt Lyon heart [noise]\nDo you see an agent in its Matt Weiner [laughter] it sounds like a eighties hair band right what did you are and then of\nCourse mark is more a Yoda Mario that it's not America's Mary Yoda it's more kids more ...\nTo Mario Mario though the grey metal Mazda Mario [laughter] fact that he got the mall right but then put an all at\nThe end of his name the commissioner doing it it just again we have you ... if you want the Heisman Trophy okay\nYou shouldn't I mean Danny Werfel was one of those guys were waffle I mean when you looked at it as like ... where where are we going with that name but I think you should be able to pronounce the name of a guy that comes away with college football's biggest price\nThat it takes a while and this is the problem yeah and I said ... been in the league how long for the Milwaukee bought yes and people in the first couple of years just like I don't remember going to know what I'm going to try it either way you lead yeah then you start to you're like OK this guy's going to be pretty good now it could be the league's MVP is an all star every year\nYou have to know his name but\nThey make sure chefs gate was outweigh all his basketball of his first few years it looked out he's going to be fired so why even worry about it and the next thing you know they're in the championship game\n... what a way to go to shut down where to get the chef decay but he was just just gives just remembers the ... the ... W s K out there as that's the easiest way to do at\nAt a um at Iowa State right now is that I Would get ... and doing our job yeah you expect at some point he's going to end up getting a job\nAnd Ryan Day the guy who took over for urban and those three games that he was suspended if he does it get a then they get old Bruce from Iowa State yeah it could have been\nThink I I think girl Bruce was originally a head\nYeah it could have been I think I I think girl Bruce was originally a head coach yeah Iowa State high high so\nSo so so now you've got you got to do you think could be perfect era parents it's urban is it all the way yeah the question is is if there's friction between him and Jean Schmidt the the what she denied this week is Jean Schmidt try to make a move and say outright urban you know it's we appreciate your turn around the program you'll you'll brought a national championship after the scandal that was was year before that\nNew era or do you just let urban Meyer do whatever Myers done because he's done the last five or what he's done the last five or six\nOr Gavin ... was it I was over for a woody I knew he had some Bruce it has to be for that I'm All right I'm going to ask you on a personal level that\nAre are you all in for urban Meyer for as long as he wants to be there or do you think the time you might be right to make a change\nI I I give him the leeway he could stay as long as he wants\nAnd I felt the same way with Jim ... I I even trust will even more so right or what you did with that well he always beat Michigan see they're not translated as well you obviously John Cooper cannot be Michigan no matter how many good teams he had he couldn't beat Michigan ... said the day was hired we will beat Michigan when he was one time in Michigan\nThey lost you know they lost in two thousand three right yeah and that was it that was that yeah that was that was the only time the other thing that an end to that point Steve there was no coincidence that Michigan took a drop when Jim trust all was the head coaches well\nOhio was so many good kids in high school right you think of the greats from Ohio where it was Desmond Howard from yeah where it was Charles woods in\nFrom all your crossovers all over yeah you guys go to Ohio said back in that sense went up right they weren't going to Michigan they were staying\nIn Ohio now urban has been able to recruit nationally and bring it you know the boats are brothers from Florida to different places but for that time period of that Jim Crow era kids weren't living\nAlone would you know that it's time to make a change how could you sense that whatever magic urban Meyer has is over\nI think if you have a couple of more lawsuits like you had a pretty remember they had the one last year against Iowa yeah where maybe just the message isn't there but the way they responded ended up dominating Michigan in the road game secure worked in the big game one the cotton ball against us see\nIf you have a couple of those next year that would probably be assigned because\nLook pretty just lost the Michigan State off of that when\nA last week a looking so great they go on the road and they end up losing by the end of the Spartans\nMaybe shows yeah the teams get up for it but there's no reason that it has to be losing back thirty points to any team in the big tent\nWhere the guy go Fox Sports radio studios some big college games are kicking up more to be played later we'll give it all the latest coming up next [noise]\nFinally does analytics show didn't think of Dodgers games\nAs your fans rejoice says your team gets with Dr advantage when it comes to

prison\nFor multiple years these guys all have family I put my lawyer had on here five of the belief that people should go to prison only in my opinion if they are making\nThe country worse or less safe\nBreak so if there is a white collar crime that is in St Louis dangerous that makes our country's economy less safe and put people in prison if you are physically violent and you are a danger to the rest of society go to prison\nIf you are paying a high school kids family\nTo go to college I fail to see how there is a crime being committed here at all other than potentially maybe tax evasion\nIf the federal government really wants to get involved and maybe you could say\nThat tax evasion I just don't buy into the idea that these guys should go to jail for years these are dads trying to make a living and you're arguing to me that they deserve to be in prison for the next several years\nBecause they have a few guys out there who they believe deserve the money that they paid

I was a split have that father you know ... father son but you know what\nA moment explaining how the game and things were happening and you know you can't really duplicate it that much with the chicken cause and it it just wasn't all those intimate experiences that you have with your father 'cause it's not a game like basketball shoot that book you know going back and forth back and forth it's not as\nFast as hockey and even in the last one game and football's pretty selfish I'm not saying that it's not ... I'm not saying that\nBut it's pretty ... and so I get to the other side and try to knock\nOn that show how how old is your\nDaughter and did you guys make it to the end\nSir I left and I proudly lab Chavez Ravine to fifty causes it off I was just an hour I mean it really was going to old state and we got to walk over there yeah but you know my daughter's twelve\nAnd I'm forty five we just you know we're just I just just aren't there things about that and um it was just really experience which you can\nAnd um but it's explain how the game that what was happening and who is this who is that yeah you know I remember all the um deployments\nI connected with Scalia because I remember ... on the political whatever reason we've got a lot of Dodgers games or the climate and I remember you know Blair the TV was one area that this is one treadmill and ... only secret spot is a threat but nobody knew about outlived but still these boys do on a truck on deployment\nAt a it was it's really one of those experiences that\nMy father gave to me and I gave her last night that ultimately a a really\nGrateful for for last I'm about it when I when I feel like I said I don't want this thing that ever\nAnd yeah I really felt like she was I went to him as\nThe the national anthem I was like God I mean ... like please don't let\nThis at what levels yo yo what\nWas your fault Joel put up a rare everybody thinks Joe ... Joe put up a prayer ... hoping to get in there you go for it works\nSo unbelievable how old are you talking about a long game the ups and downs especially if you don't the Dodger side of your Dodger fan like you think it has done is homeless and young people we just went over to middle human error now extends um and then to get to walk off I mean it's everything that you can hold for one\nNo doubt I mean yeah you're right from a Dodger fan standpoint like every pitch because you're at every moment you're like if they lose the series is over ... you know the red Sox fans or you know looking at it like halfway along as this one okay we're up to one\nSo for Dodger fan that was just seven eight straight hours of stress a let's go to David ... here in Southern California wants to talk about the same ... Hey David\nHow you doing something me this World Series sample what's the matter with baseball\nBats make it that the average pants feel stupid they don't know what they're watching what other sports that you have to go to the NBA Finals not like Iran and clay aren't going to wait at night because the computer says the match on Good Friday or threaten the\nKeep your stars on the ... the old people could understand what they're watching if a if you're telling me about your three home run hitter can't I'm like I don't even understand the sport I think your best players not weigh the costs of this but\nI'm telling you may want to catch all it's a power trip in Port world you have to keep the stars on the field for chat about the\nDamage that I think it's incredibly well said budget track this listen Rob Manfred right at the all star break talked about publicly about why might trout is it more popular and he talked about all the different things that go into making a store more popular in in a public setting yet\nBaseball as David just detailed\nSeems to go to the ends of the earth to keep their stars down you talked about the unwritten rules so therefore they cannot show emotion are now are they cannot even always play ah the starting pitcher the stars starting pitcher where's he going to go\n... your your yanked in the fourth inning the first time you throw curve in the dirt because somebody thinks oh you're tired and the next guy in the on deck circle is a you know got about five hundred batting average against you so all of these things put together tell me the baseball does not understand\nThe equation of how to make us are\nNo they certainly don't like it should be a game where you're trying to elevate the stores\nAre and everything is about playing the hits we talk about a new t._v. what I'm saying we talk about um radio you want to make sure that you're talking about you're celebrating you're promoting the people that the best in your sport and so\nIf baseball doesn't have the wherewithal to uh know that look we need to elevate of stores you to put them on the big stage we let our homerun hitters have the opportunity to hit home runs so they can draw more fans then that's stupid on the airport\nUm let's go to Nick in Nevada Nick we're a little up against the bill passed in two minutes a real quick what do you want to say [noise]\nWhy they've got a nice talking to your own I Believe that all of the points that have been made so far between you guys and all the callers are very valid and I agree that you know those are all parts of why are the ratings are down and we're having a hard time watching baseball but I also think that\nThe national sports media also has a little part of in that because\nOn them either football is such a great game and everybody loves it but the national sports media blows it off and that's all they covered that's all they talk about\nAnd I have heard a few national sportscasters one mainly on Fox that worked in the afternoon time or you know the brains are are that it was about a group of buffalo uh he he mainly him he\nHe bashes baseball during the season and then most of our our fiesta around then he starts\nTossing covering itself well don't believe that I don't need to have something to do with\nThat and then I'll I'll just say this in bucks yeah I don't know what's your perspective is Nick thank you um this is a classic chicken or the egg conversation that I think we have gone on radio a lot\nOf the media does not have an interest in blowing something up or before they know if you want to watch it it works the other way around the media is going to follow football because the data that we get shows that that's what you want\nThe media no longer talks in the mainstream about hockey why it's not because they don't like it I have a lot of friends and media were diehard hockey fans will soon worried about it on the air why is it can't don't get called the boss's office because the data says that won't work\nThe anthem right now that it was weird though you know what they did the other we were in I think we're we're in Atlanta I Believe in the playoffs they actually there were ... in the stands and they came down and they practice the anthem on the field with bands and the stands like at six o'clock if they didn't know what to do so it's better to practice sitting around drinking beers thereby kind of stand\nUp their lives you know just a dress rehearsal town [noise]\nOh my gosh the game itself three and a half hours away everybody know why am\nI here yeah water what why are they are why the why am I I don't know I'm a very sick says\nMan right out of them may then I've got ...\nAnd you and your kind of ... when\nA crate today's game is half as long as yesterday oh half has just happened while I'll take that as well\nI I mean that are being my goodness All right Bill thanks bye see ya got\nOkay bill ... LA Times is already at Dodgers stadium and apparently does everybody else the game starts in three and a half hours in last night's game just stopped for hours ago I mean\nThat that's what you do when you are in more like when you're a true fan that's what John Europe early you stay like what you're saying that's not what it is because they're not even\nAllowed in yeah biking you know what the ... ... people who live in LA or deathly afraid of awful traffic\nYeah I mean it is so you've got to get to the earth and\nYeah so people are just like a hell of all I can sleep I've been home for two hours what the hell am I just go back\nYes I I Can't believe he's trying to get rid of number six she says you know okay you know a Dodgers yeah the Dodgers trade yourself week I Am going to blow up your plastic you use Twitter\nOkay it was the only reason while I watch it because as you said is it's entertainment [noise]\nI Want to be entertained I Want to hear more easily go at it yeah I Want to hear more from your why you\nThink they should keep them coming up next we'll also continue with your calls what good baseball do to get you to watch more eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox is mark and Bucky\nOne college football is a\nWinner and block sports radio Facebook slash Fox Sports radio\nAnd don't forget about our podcast just go to Fox Sports radio dot com\nYou need your social media thing for you see these Fox Sports radio\nOfficial methods for Medicare open enrollment ends in so now's the time to be open mind looking everything prescription drug plans and money can't bong explains insurers\nWhy because climate change so can you help me I found a lower ... arm extra benefits aren't saved money open to something better than Medicare not got a call one eight hundred Medicare today I'm thinking of the ...

out for the city [noise] and he just talked about you know it's easy ideas injury phone it is they they you know people don't know if they're talking about if that's what they're saying and some of the the criticism that they're awful God [noise]\nI think is in large part due to the fact that he's a former patriot\nAnd I say that because it's like if you have an impression or an image of somebody that you went to high school with and say they weren't a hold of you in high school [noise]\nThey could go on to do great things in a year since high school and and be a completely different person but first split second let me see him again for the first time of the union you still go back to where you knew them in high school and they were in the bag [noise]\nAnd you're never going to get that out of your mind I think Jimmy ... deals with some of that because when when he got criticized for going on a date with a porn star that was a big time Warner and to me that was a big time store because he was a century it because so many people hate the patriots [noise]\nAh when the guy tears up his media [noise] instead of people saying man that's a tough break the Jimmy ... there

delivered everyone else that we can talk about the ... been really really selling but and big gays where they really needed people to come through yourself week has been a part of each of those moments\nAnd I just believe that those moments matter because we've seen guys who play differently in the postseason then they play in the regular season and if you're talking about a winning team and building a champion you have to have enough of those guys that can live on the stage is the biggest in the light sort of\nRight okay there but now we plays right field mhm what if the Dodger front

what ethic moments as you've been in to help the nationals when something this major\nI can do is one thing\nIs one thing to be a guy that plays and can kind of dance when is the regular season became new dance when his real\nHe's had some good postseason series is actually good postings are moments that some long home runs you know against the giants couple of years ago I remember that series he

years I never use the microphone in front of my face to call for somebody to get fired not my job not my car or not you know I I don't\nI have no interest in it does it doesn't matter what I think about whether or not someone should be fired that's for an athletic department or a you know a general manager to make that kind of decision there are certain situations that come along and sports where nothing needs to be said\nI'm In I I I mean I think that this was one of them\nAre you know it's the clay held in his super well liked by everybody over at USC but uh I'm just passing along there there's not a thing that I hear right now and then add this game and what's happening or there there's not one thing I hear that would suggest that he'll be back next year\nOkay so here's the thing with as seen who does is the higher [noise] like is one thing to say okay we can move on from clay hill right who are they going to bring it who was a hard hit coaching Kennedy that can handle the fresh in expectation that comes along with being in as the coach\nUm I I don't know who's out there because there are many big names that are out there\nHow about ... of it or they can't do that [laughter] I'm okay with it but they can't do that you know you're not okay I Am okay where they came with it you know they're not doing that\nI think I ... what do you think about this I think that at USC [noise]\nThis is a a a lesson I got from a good friend one time in my professional circle\nWhere a job that I had came to an end and the first thing you do whenever I whenever something like that happens in your life as you look for where else you can replicate the same thing you're like oh it was qualified to do this now let's go do the same thing over here and that friend said to me be careful about trying\nTo repeat history because it rarely works you cannot when something is kicking and click and\nYou can't just snap your fingers and make it happen again and I would get that same advice to us see that from the moment Pete Carroll got there\nAnd had lightning in a bottle every single time they have hired a new coach\nThey've tried to like scrape up he's off of the tree of what was there before with the Carol and you know ... and then there's there every single one is attached to the previous one it doesn't work it ... it's time to just do something completely new\nYeah I mean I absolutely agree like they have to find somebody there's different somebody that's not necessarily from the tree\nI'm I just don't know like the thing is clear was inexperienced coach um can they take a hike coordinator making a coach can they find a guy who was doing it at a smaller program and make\nThem the uh the name that is going to come up a per se is obviously going to be urban Meyer because of the stuff that's going on at Ohio State I feel like he's disgruntled he's not happy being at the Ohio State university right now\nMaybe maybe this is their opportunity to swoop in and have him come and build a powerhouse it is see\nThat's a tough law that's tough public ... public relations play\nOn a ... at a place that has had its share over the years that would be a difficult press release to write\nThe will be but you know what they want to win right yep something when they when they get to keep your tires and all the guys who are no winners and all I hear you I hear you 'cause it 'cause 'cause the other thing is I don't know like I don't know who's that you can't bring\nA Tom Herman from Texas because even though he grew up in LA ah seamy valley played ... Lutheran yet Texas\nSeems to be turned around and wrote and he's not going to do their job to come to the\nRight and they miss their chance on Chris Petersen\nYeah we missed their jail\nThere that now that's and that's the well I'm Talking about is like you had a chance to do something new and and you often to stick\nWith your your your G. Carroll tree and you made a mistake you did you absolutely did make a mistake\nUm yeah so ah anyway that's just something to keep an eye on I don't think it's going to be a mid season deal um but uh at this point I'd be shocked if a if play out in his back I work with a bunch of Brooks Fox Sports radio morning brown with for\nSports business reporter but also just a massive baseball fan and so he'll be perfect today he's coming up in about Fifteen minutes would be perfect due to dive into some of this stuff\nOr if you're just joining us or the ratings are down they'd been down across the board games one two and three for two of the highest profile baseball teams you could ever imagine with close games at big stars and even last night's drama the ratings are down and those first three\nGames have gone up against a total of nothing in sports\nAnd I they will go up against afternoon and evening college football tomorrow night they'll go up against Drew Brees incurred cousins they are going to get smashed apps reading it is going to be out of epic proportions and it is my hope as a baseball fan that that is the moment\nThat is the moment and that is the data that is the analytic\nThat baseball will put its arms around and say we need to make change and I am with you by she in that I'm not sure exactly how you get this across the teams but the analytics generation needs to go away it does not mean that you can't use data it does not mean that you cannot use math there's always been math\nIn baseball just look at the back of a baseball card however you cannot let that math\nGoes so over the top that you decide we don't need to be entertaining anymore provided that we are correct in terms of our percentages\nThis for me the watershed moment is the Dodgers going to the game one of the world series and sitting there top for a homerun hitters because there was a lefty on about that is an absolute you don't watch your fans and you cannot do it that is you do not work all year to get to the world series so that you can dump your best players on the bench\nNo I mean no one wants to see I mean no one wants to see that no one wants to see your ...\nI mean no one wants to see I mean no one wants to see that no one wants to see your for home run hitter sitting on the sideline because\nUh analytics told you wasn't a good play but here's what I Want to kind of spin a little way from baseball but more to the analytics crowd in general or how did you feel about past Sherman going for two on the Monday Night game when they were down fourteen\nYeah I think he is currently I Believe it's over thinking it it doesn't bother me that much like whatever your thought is on what makes the most sense percentage wise but here's why I laughed at that I laugh at that because every coach will go to the press conference just like sure are dead and and they'll say well\nWe've run the numbers and uh it says that that's the right thing to do well no you didn't you un numbers that are global you ran numbers for all football teams\nThat means if you buy them you believe all quarterbacks at the same you believe all receivers at the same you believe all off in some lines of the same and they're not so you can't tell me the analytic when you're down fourteen points you scored a touchdown since we should go for two\nAnd then we're going to expect the same result whether your quarterback Aaron Rodgers or your quarterback like Miami\nThat's why that made me laugh because it's an analytic that's true but it's it's it's being received in a fake way\nI'm a little bit I I I think like here's a here's the thing like the more because they got for print out on like\nTo get the rest of what ... says pod cast it by searching out kick the and it's always you can hear I'll get the coverage with clay Travis weekdays at six am eastern three am Pacific right here on Fox Sports radio is the\nTime and time again about LeBron James being a Laker and he's just been completely supportive I kind of thought he really doesn't want LeBron to see but you know what I'm starting to believe that he does\nThis is his place he was here for Twenty years I'd live live around the field I think he was Lubrano fluff\nYou are listening to the trouble with Chris Broussard Enron Parker see about that we said that seven pm eastern port be emphasis it back\nOn Fox Sports\nFan mail or show\n\nThe giants in raiders have decided by NFL standards we are going to take one of the\nThings that ... ball people bragged about said it was there they never mailed it and then you can have baseball teams give up to throw up the white flags and basketball teams do it but he says boarded with what Paul DNA than\nMount nights at two AM eastern eleven pm Pacific Fox Sports

built to save you time and money by allowing you to compare multiple quote options all on line so head to progressive dot com today and see if you can say [noise]\nOkay with Russia broke Margaret Willard Fox Sports radio [noise] we got to get into a program abroad and a little bit later this hour about oh yeah oh my gosh and you might need to punch me on the\nFence okay I Can't take it anymore and you can't take it anymore you\nKnow a lot of that will be my battery is I Can't take it anymore I Will get to that are coming up at about fifty minutes or so but right now\nWe're getting more a Brown in here the absolute perfect voice for today here's why more brown with for sports business reporter also a national baseball writers so therefore understand and it's a huge baseball fan so more you're all over baseball yet you're also all over sports business\nAnd right now those two things don't seem to be getting along very well\nIf you ask me like games one two and three all stood alone on the sports landscape with two flagship franchises close games big stars\nRatings are still down now we go into the weekend they're going to get killed by the saints and Vikings tomorrow night in my opinion what is baseball and they do\nWell I mean it's a great question I mean you mentioned in it in their two storied franchises I mean if you're going to sit down and try this out\nIn their two storied franchises I mean if you're going to sit down and try and map this out you know I mean you you probably couldn't have put to better together I mean the Yankees maybe but I mean they hadn't met since Nineteen twenty four I'm so you had this long tenure they're both in two huge markets\nUm I don't know what baseball does I mean look I think I think the thing that everybody and look this is not\nJust me the commissioner and the folks at Fox or trying to grapple with is why and you know you could sit there and look at maybe this idea of bolt pending um has lost a lot of average viewers the fact that um the bloom is maybe a little bit off the bus in terms of\nYou know the it's just not as compelling anymore to have Boston when as many World Series is they have it's quite different than two thousand four so I'm\nCourtney [noise] quite a bit of play\nHere and let me jump in on their morning so you can clear throat a little bit but ah yeah quite a bit of play for sure I think some of the things you're talking about all come from the same place don't they would you analytics I mean that's what I was saying earlier I'm and I'm analytics maybe rights they may be mathematically correct they're not funds from fans\nIt's not fun to tune into the Dodgers on game one of the world series and their top for homerun hitters are on the bench that just seems silly\n[noise] yeah I mean you know certainly if you looked at this I mean last night's game was a record setter for\nA number of things I mean we went through Eighteen pictures and that tells you a lot when you look at how many hits that were which is either tells you that where there's a lot of swing and Mrs or there's a case where everybody's so closely\nAligned in terms of being able to hit that you get that the I think I get it you know you're like hey let's go ahead and make sure that we're ready left you mash\nUps and let's keep those guys sitting on the bench we saw that there was a little bit of a change in the lineup for game three that didn't seem to move the needle dramatically one way or an or another and I just think that people are trying to sit there trying to figure out you know which of these teams are there look the other thing clearly is\nThe red Sox are an awfully good baseball team I mean look they they handled\nI'm not only the Yankees but the Astros both teams hundred wind teams handily\nAnd I think that there's something to say about that I think that people are like wow this is\nJust you know there's no Cinderella there's nothing really to look forward to here and I just think that it it looks like two became is trying to slug it out and then once again I just don't know if there's that much in terms of a compelling story line I keep waiting for many Machado to break out I kept waiting for him to not swing it at\nPictures up and out of his own he just cannot seem to lay off a high hot stuff so you know it's starts to become highly predictable\nYou know more so much of the conversation the leaders in ... in a lunatic thin or analytics ruining the game we see in the deepest and she is we're making it very difficult for hitters a divine holes in the defense what do you think about the process or\nWhat do you think of the impact in the middle of the game and can we blame analytics for some of the lack of viewership when it comes to people wanting to watch the game\nNo I I'm not going to put this an analytic Fiedler guys I'm I'm a huge proponent of it now there is a shift I think you know probably something that makes it difficult we thought for the longest time I came from the school that it was like hit it where there ain't right I mean if if your shipping everybody over to one side of the field and by golly hit the other way\nAnd we're not seeing that what we're seeing our batters deciding you know what if I hit it out of the ballpark it doesn't matter where you put people on the field I'm just going to drive it out where you can't get to it and so I think we see a lot of that I mean strike outs were up we had more strike outs and hits this\nYear it was just you know it's kind of an odd state right now so I don't know I mean ... are largely though I think in the world series we've seen a little bit more\nStation to station plan spots which I think it's interesting you know but I mean still overall I think we're just looking for some kind of compelling story and I think guys since since the the cubs won and broke that futility streak and the red Sox broke their\nFused to lease street look last year was up\nAnd I think maybe that has a little bit to do with once again kind of having two big markets in there that don't have you know big stories for whatever reason that's the only reason I mean last year was up and I don't think the players change that dramatically other than how the ... are being used and look if you use a bunch of pictures and have a lot of commercial breaks\nGames are going to get along and people are going to switch the channel\nMore brown with for sports business reporter is with us mark and Bucky Fox Sports radio\nMaury how much of this is off you know I I don't know baseball always assessing what's the problem is well 'cause it's like oh we need to move quicker and like well football games are just as long oh we need more scoring well soccer's grid going you know going up in popularity\nWhat is this just two thousand Eighteen and and we may not have the attention span for something like baseball\nNow I think that's really what it is and this is the difference guys between the idea of pace and link the games and they're they're somewhat related but they you know they aren't in other words look if you if you're both panning and use a lot of pitchers every time that they pull somebody out of the book and we're going to a commercial break and that just loses your momentum\nWhen you had starters that could go you know maybe as many as seven or eight innings right you could have some sense of momentum\nAnd that was really something they kept people view to the television I think that that is a large part of this you know they tried to take care of this by limiting mound visits and you know that's helped 'em in you know we no longer have four pitches to get on base if you want to automatically walk somebody\nBut I Do think that there's something to be said about the Christmas of games and that's something that just doesn't want to buy very well there's something about games that move along at a good pays that's different than the length of games\nLike more a real quick you're a baseball fan you're watching these games do you think that these are good baseball viewing games\nYou know what I don't and I mean that's\nThat's a hard thing for me to say I thought that this year in general was just kind of down and it just largely is that thing I keep looking for some sense of movement to the games themselves look it's a World Series I'm not going to miss a second of it and they're great plays and great moments\nEvery single game I I just cannot stress that enough but the thing about it is is they seem to be getting stretch further apart due to how this is getting broken up so I don't know how you deal with the guys I don't know what Rob Manfred can do pitch clock sure maybe but if you're still using eight hundred pitchers again\nMean I'm sure it is a work around I'm sure it can be communicated a but let's just say they're playing on the up in up I Am sure that the way that baseball is done now with the analytics and and the like that before the game a day robbers meets with the people who have the numbers and have the book they talk about\nTime to go strategies before the game who will be the first pinch hitter who's going to be the first uh get off the bench rigging this situation going through all the different scenarios\nSo even though they may not talk today Roberts uh in real time in the moment there's certainly been a kind of like a undivided gushing over how they want to play this game who they want to utilize in one of the best time to utilize certain parts of your person on the roster\nEight seven seven million

now the U.S again [noise] our law and the guy go far once radio studios fifty minutes with that if it's been present a montage drugs that are Tom for favorite quote so I'm seeing some people on Twitter criticize her backwards look I was just happened\nTo his ah thirty one it's one of the day that the top [noise] there's about\nMinute and change to go in to get us he does not have any time about their use quarterback breaks through the line on the run\nAnd he's got nothing but green grass in front of him or he takes it all the way to the house so scores you touched down you're going to head with just over ... minutes ago but now you're given the ball back us see mhm and some people that huh\nBut now you're given the ball back to you I see mhm and some people say harm you gotta you gotta have you got to have you guys know\nIn that situation to just fall down because then you Neil out the clock and the games over instead now as he's got the ball in theory they could get a touchdown and go for an arm sidekick\nAnd tied the game if they get that on site kick\nWell they did just scored a touchdown and now with thirty five seconds they're only down by three again and doubt to conduct an armed sidekick and we'll see if they get it you know they probably won't but uh let's say ball bounces up in the air now asked your coverage and so they'll escape\nBut in that situation I always go why are we blaming the coach like in you you coach at the high school level don't these players like they're big enough to know that that thought and that idea aren't they\nKnow more you'd be surprised pro players on big enough really hits you really really you have to kind of talk\nI'm over and over about situation awareness so one of the teams that\nHas always been the best team when it comes to a situation of football has been to New England patriots and one of the reasons why is because they are committed to not only talking about those situations\nThey practice those situations Bill Belichick gifts pop quizzes on those situations and when I've asked other coaches well why is New England so good and everyone knows that they're good at situational football how come everybody isn't that good\nHe said because of the coaches are lazy and they don't want to spend the time that goes into being good situation of football usually they don't want to take the time to go over all of those scenarios they don't teach it they don't spin\nThey don't go to the level of detail that build a check in the patriots go same thing down in Alabama when it comes to Nick statement\nThey are detailed meticulous about making sure that their players understand situations at all times and most coaches don't have the band with nor the discipline to say that I'm a make sure that all my players truly understand\nSituational football they'll give lip service but the actions don't always match up with the words\nWell play to win that game I Will I Will back\nYou up on this you know I Know a handful of guys who who used to play for the patriots and it's it's not like other systems I mean they do they they refer to it is I don't know if they use the word jail but it's like they don't they don't when you're a patriot you don't have a life you're not allowed to have a life\nAnd so it's it's ... taking the time to go over each scenario doesn't just mean like oh boy state after work a few minutes no no no I mean it's like ballot check his round the clock\nAnd okay so ... so so I Do it in terms of you and I'm working on this rocket okay so the night before you always send me a very detailed emailed on hey here the topics here's what we're going to cover\nAll the way we live in and then I'm going to view yeah\nYeah like he is what we got [noise] or whatever\nOkay well let's think about maybe some of the guys that you work with who don't have that level of detail and who don't have that level of attention to all of the things and how your show may suffer because their preparation isn't up to your level\nWill when we talk about these games and most games and football and decided by seven points are less will the guys that are really committed in focus to really make sure that their players understand\nThe details how you win games and those things they're the ones that when Marty shutting Homer told me a long time ago when I was playing against that he said this and it resonated\nI'm more games are lost than one if you can just go out and get your team not to lose the game many don't turn the ball over don't have a lot of penalties make sure you understand what you're supposed to be what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it\nYou wind the overwhelming majority of all your games and looking at how his career played out he wants you and your games and yet people are taking the tests were not winning in the playoffs right but each and every year he won ten or eleven games\nJust because he wouldn't lose games and then you may not win a championship like that but you will always be in the hunt if you can kind of buy into a let's make sure we do the things that we can control if we can control the control room and a lot of games\nWell I mean I'll also just add that just because the kid didn't fall down doesn't mean Hermeto works didn't tell him to the other thing I should other things like well blamed recall she was like well I don't know if I I who knows what he told them right\nYeah you you never know because you can tell man we we've sold\n[laughter] around over and over again light so the two weeks ago\nWhen I came a late because I was coaching my game on a Saturday\nAt the end of the half his the balls on the thirty nine yard line they're eleven seconds left the other team does not have a timeout hitters third Nineteen so all you tell your players we all the time out and said hey\nDon't let him out of bounds don't let him throw it over the head you know what happens mark\nThey threw it over our head for a touchdown so you can talk about it and it still may not clicking resonate with the player\nNo brother I got three kids you don't need to tell me [laughter] it sounds like things are just that the people that they ignored [laughter] I mean is it is a five minute by five minute thing yes I have heard the words of my house what did I just [laughter]\nSad why why did I say to let that adds a yes though it's a it is it is difficult or by the way I wanted to follow up with you because it was last week\nYou said and I got some ideas on how to fix the shah of watts it did you see those things on Thursday night\nI did I fix them you so you say that affects them look a lot of people that want to thank you man I Know\nA couple of things that are played out the last two weeks since I wrote the article about the show us and its on reading NFL dot com I Am and that's my guy guy he just shot\nI'm Lamar Miller has been a factor when it comes to running the ball I talked about they need to take pressure of the shower and wash them by run into football\nThe last couple of weeks they've been able to run the football will and because of that it's played out last two games the more ... has had over one hundred yards in each of those games on the ground\nWhen you can run the ball it allows your quarterback to play in a comfort level and allows your team to control the game the other thing I talked about we'll full of needing to be a factor a willful there in the show was and had a major connection\nLast year he uses vertical guy he could push it down to feel\nLast two games real father had made some place now fortunately willful the towards they feel on Thursday night and he's not going to be and he's not gonna be available to them so they're gonna have to find another deep threat\nBut they found out that they're able to get ready to return from the Sean by asking him to do less not more fewer pass attempts\nFuel responsibilities allow him to play and I don't want to say as a gay manager but really\nKeep them on a pitch count don't expose them to so many hits because he was getting beaten to a pope the first few weeks of the season\nThey are now beginning to play kind of a ball control style and that is allowing him to flourish more teams need to do that with a young quarterbacks they're running game matters even though this league is shifting to a passing league\nAnd they didn't want to keep the begin with because he can't tell you they're changing can't tell his own players hey we're tanking jog godly\nWendy's during the um eastern he's much more well rounded knocks\n... for\nThe past the Mexican Americans how fresh independent tax big twelve\nMid America something about Britain usa\nAll of your schools are ramps right here\nYour legs for Fox Sports radio\nSo your Sunday with Fox NFL kickoff joined some uh football's Tom opinion makers as they provide unique perspective and expert analysis we actually have some are on a ... am eastern on Fox Fox Sports [noise]\n\n\n[noise] yeah that's the Georgia Bulldogs radio network and the second touched down to the game for Jeremiah Harlem and are now joins us to live on Fox Sports radio we are going to move wrecked euchre back about ten minutes but he'll do join and let's get Jeremiah Jeremiah congratulations on the Web\nSite you something that you got to go into those we're uh we're doing fantastic are good for you guys I I I Wonder\nCertainly Everytime you go play you you you try to win but I Wonder is now that you've been on a top ten team you guys sort of feel like you have one of those signature when necessary to impress the people who vote on this kind of thing\nA lot of like it weighs a lot uh honestly you know it's it's up there and they can they can be a lot of people you know the daughters and things like that we came out we play the game that we need to come out successful\nYou know you're talking about the world's largest cocktail party or how does what does that robbery mean being on the Georgia side of it\nIt was great I mean uh non non history and stuff like that just on his first time since the eighties the Georgia is one ... years so I mean knowing that we're a part of that no one I was a big contributor today I mean that's that's great\nAnd right now Jeremiah you guys this when and and the opportunity to play\nKentucky next week or if you guys when that you guys are going to you know how to control your own destiny in the SEC ease and obviously then it sets up potentially down the road you guys might be able to face Alabama how bad the do you want to play that game\nI mean it's not really about like who are blind which is whoever whoever's in the way whatever you have to do to get what we want to because we we we don't want it in a closed book too early so that's that's really what it is you know\nJim are you guys are forcing because you have to really really good quarterback today obviously Jake from headed going Seventeen to twenty four two hundred and forty three touchdowns but talking about the quarterback situation Jay from Justin feels or to both of those guys bring to the table\nOr I mean liberal I'm there to different types of quarterbacks but ah you know not knowing that I saw this on uh they they correct each other they they make each other better in the day this is what they do so that's that's what it boils down to uh so yeah and that's that's really helpful for us 'cause I mean we don't really have a bet there's a quarterback situation\nJeremiah Harlem and Georgia receiver joining us by sports radio how different is the life of a receiver are based on who is the quarterback you know different styles oh what what what is different for you in those scenarios [noise]\nOh what the I mean really we don't lose the or who their quarterback just knowing uh they both get the job done basically are both of them are on the tape will know do we gotta do to do everything so yeah\nJeremiah we really appreciate it a few minutes here Tom thank you and she grabs again no problem OK\nOkay Jeremiah Harlem in Georgia receiver with a couple of thoughts down today at Georgia Tech South Florida vi final uh thirty six Seventeen\nAnd now they're on the road at Kentucky as kind of jarring Bucky to look at their schedule and seeded Kentucky is a twelve reading him in the nation I'm like I'm On the right I'm On the football page right I Can't really be Kentucky is writes wealth in the nation\nI mean is unbelievable but they look they have some really good players a student a really good job getting those are getting Kentucky on track then a dog fight right now they are a play in Missouri but the person in both zone therefore you're going in down forty nine but they are playing really really well on defense\nThey will be a stiff challenge for the Georgia Bulldogs\nAnd when I think about Georgia or is unique that you have two quarterbacks that can both stored and make a ton of plays Jake from obviously these guys to the national title game of seasons ago um he has become ability but a kid playing behind and just appeals was no more\nRecruit in the country become quarterback um Jeremiah mentioned iron sharpens aren't the competition at the quarterback position normally it can kind of praying fracture team\nBut in Georgia for whatever reason it seems like it's working we'll see how they continue to play out with this team did in the middle\nIt was like his working we'll see how it continues to play out with this team did in the middle of a hut to go get a national title\nOr keep you up to date on that Kentucky Missouri game right now Kentucky has moved the ball in Missouri Territory they're closing in on about a minute to go\nFourteen to nine Missouri leads Kentucky Rick euchre will join us in about five minutes while we're talking about quarterbacking all eyes as we approach the trade deadline seemed to be on the raiders because they've been the most active\nIs Derek are going to get moved it certainly feels like you walk but Bucky I was interested to read your article that you have this week where you wrote view where of the draft than Rick rebuild for John grew in what do you mean by that what do you think's gonna happen next is running everyone\nIs excited because I think we all see ourselves as general managers because fantasy sports it allows us to kind of have their own theme so we think hey man drafting is just either we'll just go drafted players that we need and poof\nA waiver to replace the ... replacing them more Cooper and get whatever we need right away and that would immediately changed the fortunate the franchise\nWhen you go back and you really look I'm drafting in the first round is a fifty fifty proposition in terms of you hit rate in terms of hitting ... not only at like a starter but a high level player and so those five picks over the next two years were saying maybe they'll get two and a half players\nThat can play at a high level where the trick is I'm\nIn the league in history you haven't seen people have success when they've had multiple picks and the first round fine to a more pro ball players that can reach that status in multiple seasons so what John route and is trying to do is something that the U.S who just can't be done he is going to replace\nAnd offer a player in little Mac and a pro ball player to both pro ball player in a more Cooper and address I just don't think is going to happen because when you look at history down in Tampa he didn't really make 'em\nHeadway with a lot of great picks he didn't have those kind of the players that elected when he looked at it I just don't think is a good place for the Oakland Raiders but time until if John ruined is able to restart their roster and get them playing like they were playing two years ago\nWhile and Reggie McKenzie is not going to be there anymore that certainly seems like the secret is out and so it is going to be on Gurdon and maybe does better this time around I just look at the whole picture and I I feel like people would be saying good things about the raiders if they had simply done mess let's say this I'm Ari\nCooper trade had happened early in the seas and maybe even before it a first round or for mark Cooper fact I even think today people like that's pretty good cause Cooper's been you know he's been great and then he's been not so great at other times\nSo they get a first round pick that's really good the reason people are laughing at it though is because he also came in the wake\nOf the ... which was not a good decision if John Goodman simply to look that I'm Ari Cooper and said I think we can do better and he looked at their car and said I think we can do better we're not going to win a Super Bowl with those being the two best players on or off ads\nPeople would have bought it and then he could have kept ... Matt fucking traded the wrong one at the start of the season\nYes they traded a wrong one there's no reason for them to treat ... can I can go back in detail why they didn't need to train them at the time that he did um but and I'll say briefly ... back was playing on the fifth year option the raiders had the opportunity to put the franchise tag on ... Mac and back to back years\nAfter that so for this year and the next two years basically for three years they still have a little Mac under their control without having to put him in a long term deal no matter\nHow much she was crying and whining about wanting a new deal they did not have to ... they still could have had him on the hit their control\nAt a deal that really play to the team\nFor whatever reason John brutal was well he was too much money he let him out the door\nThe issue that you have is ... is a proven player everyone in the locker room knows that he is a tough player disposition they know that he's especially play or maybe even the best player\nHe was the best player on their team when you trade that away and then you come back a few months later and you treat them more Cooper way another guy that is recognized in the locker room as one of the best players\nThe locker room is now looking at John group inside ways they're wondering ... is this do really in to get now or is this part of a ten year plan and um unfortunately going to be caught up in the wash and not really able to compete in for feel some of the things I Want to\nBut I I Need to see it at crunch time I need to see it when when I Need a D to go take over a series to impose basically like again if you're talking about their size you're talking about a D you go back and you watch that playoff series last year you didn't see Anthony Davis\nDanny Davis should should should not allow dream on green to play him even or to uh to be able to handle him one on one\nTo play him even or to uh to be able to handle him one on one he should be drawing additional attention\nAnd forcing a the the warriors to make a decision do we double or do we double ID or do we stay at home and we let him get his ah and worry that he'll he'll take over the game and and beat us that way\nHe didn't do that and for the pelicans to do everything that you hope they will that's what he has to\nDo wreck wonderful to have you as always appreciate your flexibility thank you you got a guy\nOkay read euchre senior Indian writer bridge report joining us marketed Bucky Brooks Fox Sports radio and the

of Israel did they disregarded God's warning God said they're going to be us nearer to you they're going to turn your hearts away and apparently they thought or it's not so dangerous it's not so bad\nA guide gets worked up about nothing and so they went ahead and ignored God's word and got involved with the chain tonight's who were in the promised land before Israel got there\nAnd again and I did just as God said they would they turned the hearts of the people of Israel the way they became more and more immoral or more and more ... more and more\nOf the then and eventually a godsend okay it's got to stop and the Israelites were\nConquered by the Babylonians the the the people that Judah Jerusalem were they were carried away to Babylon they were slaves and exiles for Seventy years and then they come back and that's where we you know that's where ... comes into the story\nAnd the the people have come back and what did they do the first thing they do is they begin to get mixed up with the Canaan nights again\nUh it says in as rich chapter nine verse won the people of Israel the priest and to leave I had not separated themselves\nFrom the people's ... with their ... nations have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons\nAnd when as or heard this he was appalled he said as soon as I heard this I tore my garment and Mike cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat appalled\nHe couldn't believe it after all we've been to the the conquest of the exiled to the slavery the whole thing we're finally said free from that\nAnd the first thing you do is go back to the sin that caused all of that in the first place and so the people said let us make a covenant with regard to put away all these wives and their children\nSo some of the chain tonight wives or that the Israelites are married had already born children for them they'd been married long enough for that\nBut they said we're going to put the way that is they sent back to their fathers to their families they send them away they sent their children away [noise]\n[noise] well Moses said if a if a man find some in decency in her well these are religious abominable religious practices apparently were and in decency\nA God said they're going to turn your hearts away and there was a spiritual danger there they sent them back to their families\nThat's maybe the the most prominent example it comes to mind of the application in the Old Testament\nAnd it's the mind of the application in the Old Testament of the words of Moses if she find the favorite aside because he's found some and decency in or register certificate censor way that's what that was about\n[noise]\nA Jesus said to them [noise] that is to the ... because of your hardness of heart the Moses wrote you this amendment or gone wrong to discriminate because people have hardness of heart because sometimes there is a\nA spiritual dangerous when God said to the Israelites in the Old Testament they will turn your hearts away they will cause you to send 'em\nThey have heart hearts because you're apart arts\nGod gave you this command Moses their God gave it through Moses ah\nSometimes it just doesn't work sometimes there is\nConstant animosity sometimes there is abuse sometimes it just doesn't work a marriage doesn't work because people have hard hard says God want people to have\nOur dark you know a guard hopes for better things God intended better things and Jesus said from the beginning of creation and God made the male and female and therefore a man show leave his father and mother hold fast to his wife and the two she'll become one flash so there are no longer too\nBut one flash what they're for God has joined together\n... not man separate\nSee this was God's intention when ... when the story of creation stalled in the book of genesis gone looked at the things that you've done at the end of the day and he said this is good this is good but finally guide came to a place where he said oh this is not good what was he talking about he says not good for a man to be alone [noise]\nGod did not want man to be lonely\nAnd so God set about to solve the problem of man's loneliness\nAnd to solve that problem he created a helper suitable to fit for corresponding to complementary to man he created woman and he created a relationship that we call marriage and the complimentary character\nOf the two parties in the marriage the male and female and the nature of the marriage is designed to solve the problem of loneliness or in a way nothing else Ken God didn't create a softball league when he said oh it's not good for men to be alone he needs some buddies all get 'em to softball he\nNo he didn't give them a hunting partner of fishing partner all good relationships all important relationship but God did something even more than that he created marriage and in marriage they are no longer to that's the mystery of the Bible on what could be the Asians says yeah that's a mystery\nThey're no longer to God has joined them together down one flash\n[noise] there is no other relationship in human experience like the relationship of husband and wife\nAt least that's the way God intended it to be that's how it is when people do it right\nWhen people do it to the way a God intended but people don't always do it that way because sometimes they have a hard hearts and sometimes there is faced listen to us that's what is addressed in Malik I chapter too where are the people were complaining and saying why doesn't got answer our prayers\nAnd God says to them that I Am a witness between you and the wife of your youth to whom you have been faceless\nThose shoes your companion and your wife by covered\nLet none of you'd be faceless to the wife of your use for the man who\nDoes not love his wife was divorces versus the lord the God of Israel covers his garment with violence so\nGod said sometimes husbands are faceless to their wives that is they made a pledge they made a commitment that we're joined together they became one flesh but then the husband starts to look around and he sees somebody else who is a younger or\nOr prettier or something\nAnd he thinks a man I'm going to trade up and so he dumps the wife up his use or to get himself a trophy wife\nAnd God's or hate that I hate that baseless and as you made a pledge she has been your companion bike covenant and you'd dumped her to get some trophy wife God says I\nHate that so the command given to Moses\nThat sometimes it has to end that's not a license to be baseless and that's not an endorsement of people having hard hearts\nGod's intention for marriage\nIs that it would be the best solution in this world\nTo the problem of loneliness that would be a relationship companionship [noise] a a union unlike any other in human experience only because people have hard hearts and people are sometimes faithful is that\nA marriage has to end it was never God's intention but\nSometimes it has to be\nAnyway God's intention is that marriage would be a blessing\nTo all\nOur father who art in heaven hallowed be thy kingdom come I Will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread for give us our trust passes as we forgive those who trespass against us\nAnd lead is not into temptation but deliver us from evil for China's the kingdom power and

quarterback and first round draft pick Brady quit\n[noise]\nSo it's something that you knew had that happen at some point you knew it had to happen at some point\nYou you couldn't believe that it hasn't happened yet almost that it convinced you it was never going to happen at all and it involves an NFL quarterback ... and I will tell you who that is coming up here momentarily here on Fox Sports radio as we can be alive you are from the guy go Fox Sports\nRadio studios were Fifteen minutes could they be Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit guy go dot com for a free rate quote\nBrady you have you ever had a buddy of yours who's in a relationship that all you guys are you guys have conversation amongst yourselves and he's not there and even sometimes when he is there and you guys have been having a few beers and uh you you keep telling him why are you still with her [laughter]\nI mean ... like are you guys all you guys do\nIs fight why do you know I actually ah had a good buddy in college and he lived with us for I Want to see we made it two weeks and they would fight so much and it would be all these like late night argument yeah that I guess he was basically staying in the room like across from mine\nAnd so I just walked over when I say there you go to get the ... you you got to get back out I like I often use different verbiage but said you did to leave and he said what do you mean I was like I don't know what tomorrow they'll get a hotel your family's rich go figure it out you can't stay here anymore okay I've got six than workouts\nI'm taking seven hours of class I Can't take this anymore okay figure it out like like cut it off or move forward if you actually ended up\n... wow I didn't ... you're actually going to call a ... like that on the air that is a little bit more calling us from college I kept it was not just um so uh\nAnd and the reason I bring this up is because they'll be situations and maybe they'll break up for a little while but I guarantee you been around somebody where they say a now man this time I mean it it's for good and you kind of roll your eyes aren't sure man 'cause you know two days later they going to get back together\nUm I Am stunned that it actually happened in the NFL\nThat Blake morals actually got benched I didn't think\nIt was going to ever happen I Swear to God you know what happened last preseason right did you have been slashed ... well but I'm like nine days later they started him for the opener\nYet but I didn't think that they would actually have the guts to pull it off I didn't think that they would actually bench Blake portals but there I was watching the Jacksonville Jaguars game which is never a good time and I'm watching Cody cancer and I'm thinking to myself\nWhat happened here like did you really go through with this like he actually went through that they actually decided to part ways mid game was played bottles and ... took over what did you make of the ... or ...\nHe didn't say well I mean look he he you know twelve pass at Sam's put that sign that he was an importer that was it wasn't that wasn't as if there was that much pressure there was some\n... but she just started taking off and try to run I mean he really got out of even just trying to throw the ball down the field at all\nAnd he had a couple of ... and I think the than you'll Hackett they're off as a coordinator was probably frustrated I I'm sure Doug aromas frustrated officer Tom ... has been frustrated where they invest that money into this guy even though they were going to have to pay in many ways that picked up his fifth year option\nUm they invested money and this guy for this year and then the two years after but as you and I talked about not deal went down\nIt was really a one year deal after this year there's no guarantees wrapped up the team could cut him and not oh um anything under the dead cap\nAnd it's a much more tradable contract so essentially what they did was they extended his contract still with basically being a one year deal but the ability to the trade him and get back compensation for him or if they want to have things don't work out after this year that's essentially what they did\nBut he was bad bad I mean and I don't think\nYou like you have you ever watch the Jacksonville Jaguars then you've missed out on him hitting his office of women in the helmet a him making some Aaron throw\nEnvironmental and by the way he's six five All right we're like yeah we're not we're not talking about Peter ... of game of Thrones playing quarterback who's ... is often to fly him and he's six five and hitting is often some limited back in the helmet\nHim um you know everyone throws bad decisions\nUm you know lead against human rushing because he just thinks that every drop back passes supposed to be a draw um that's that's actually what it's been it's been frustrating to watch because the defense they've got a defects that should be able to win you a Super Bowl but he's so inspiring now those guys who can spin\nAnd other fighting post game boy that they're right they were going after each other post game apparently\nOf course because the Audrey Hopkins was won't put up on jail labs like as soon as ... as a planet high level you've really got some issues because he is by far and away their best player on defense that's saying something because\nCalvin Smith is a stood AJ boy is not bad shot Gibson's good with Campbell ... they've got to do and you know ... she was getting beat by Dodgers Hopkins bad today\nI'm a ... by the way I think we did play the game a couple of weeks ago I guess the melt down by the ... defense here on Fox Sports radio I'm almost positive and I think we got that one correct to we did that I think we got ... correct to end the jags defensive meltdown correct so everyone has said it\nWas going to be before the their the Thursday night primetime game I said it would happen before the\nWhile it can run a plus rating when he does it again folks I mean there's nothing this man can't do there is nothing you can't let me just\nLet me run down the list of things the Brady fighting I'm going to run down the list as they get back to get um [noise] can be a starting quarterback at Notre Dame right\nHe can do that ... can be a first round draft pick in the NFL Brady

was in assessing his quarterback play post game\nI'm focused on how do we stop tournament over so it's hard for me and my mind to sit here right now and try to say well we can do this and we can do we can't do until we stop turning the ball ... that's just how it is\nIt's just beautiful the way that rolls off his tongue just the way he's able to break down and what's going on in Jacksonville gosh good stuff by a ... they're still the best team in that division and I don't care what anybody says Houston's\nIn the state will be mostly Connie with the highest degrees with areas that shower

Thursday at seven thirty eastern on Fox's now [noise]\nKnow you're not breathing clock sports radio having somebody from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios in where we are going to feel like or\nWhat the ah we should talk about what what do you want to talk about in the NBA or what is your son\nTalk about what what do you want to talk about in the NBA or what it is\nI mean he was reading about one particular incident that Ronda jammed to proceed aggravated over really really well God but\nThey are getting good snap at the end of the job or some video does it does appear that he may it's battling it was on Chris Paul can can I just said this I think it's good for the NBA of course it is [noise] they need to actually\nGet in fights because they kind of seemed like the ... where you know like they're all going to talk and get really close to each other like they're almost which brings three nothing's each other's ear and then finally find that we actually had some guys land a punch and yell Rondo looks like he knows how to fight a little bit so even more respect to raise Ron\nRon Angela and you know what I said this and and I got destroyed for it but I'm the use an athlete can even speak to this Brandon Ingram has always had this knock on him that he's soft and that he doesn't have that dog in him and you may not like the idea that he pops Chris Paul well Chris Paul was engaged in another fight but the fact that he actually did throw a punch\nPlayers are going to remember that around the league and I actually think it changed the narrative on if you don't have to like the punch you'd have to like the tactics but at the same thing with ... perfect yeah may maybe dirty player he may hit guys when they're not looking or take cheap shots\nBut tell me how many times that hasn't paid dividends when a guy goes over the middle of the ... ... is there that guy's not thinking about oh well don't worry I'll take the hit 'cause he's gonna get fined sixty Kay\nHe's thinking I don't want to get my head ripped off so I actually think it's it's going to end up benefiting Brandon Ingram and it's going to change the way guys play him moving forward I really do\nWhether or not you think it's a a bad tactical disrespectful or classless it's irrelevant because when it comes down to the war of sport um you know class and sportsmanship is is usually spoken of more for when people lose\nYou know it was let's just be honest when when people when they're regarded as winners and whether they are classier not that's not the first thing you think of\nIt the way people lose I think is when people talk about that more so to that point\nYou know people are going to do in that arena whatever they can do to win even if that means playing those sort of mental head games where yeah it might be a fight or an old circulation or it could be something like that but in college football when you got Jeb Bush\nWho's walking through this this team um tradition that Michigan State does before every game she knows it he knows they're going to be out there doing their walk\nAny standards grad and tries to walk right through him to pick a fight if you don't think that that if fire Michigan State up of course but if you didn't think that it didn't fire up his team she may players often stick in this dude is gonna be talking trash the whole time you buy cheap shot me of course that's in the back of your mind\nYeah no I I I think it's going to benefit Brandon Ingram and I think and I was saying that in a weird way if you if you get in trouble like guys getting in trouble together\nGuys are weird man it's like this built in camaraderie you know like if you ever like getting a fight with a group of dude Z or you're you're on the field of play and and you stick up for a lineman you guys are sort of linked and that's a story you're going to be sharing for the rest of your lives they were that one time we got in trouble at one time we did this bill to certain camaraderie\nPeople can knock raised on Rondo for potentially spending on Chris Paul or brand in anger for maybe taking a cheap shot I actually think it's going to bring those guys together cause that's going to be a story there'll be talking about and goofing around about in the locker room for a long time so I didn't think it was that bad\nOff what a what a black guy for the NBA can you believe these guys are fighting they ruined what\nWas a great opening weekend in the NBA shut up man it's or it's people are going to fight stop being so over dramatic\nOkay so did you find it odd that Lubrano grabbed Chris Paul and not as if\nThat's the thing to watch because that's the one that's not going to play well in the locker room not not Brandon Ingram getting suspended for games or or is on Rhonda spinning the fact that LeBron defended Chris Paul and that those other guys is the one that I think it's going to have a\nI don't I don't know that it's defending but I Would just think that it it at all or ... or a fight right your natural instinct right if you're at a bar\nAnd this actually [laughter] so what actually started to give it to ... what are the guys from our crew this past week and and I was thinking the back of my mind um you know if if somebody wants to happen like how would I react in that scenario because you're you're in the spotlight you know there's really no upside down side right\nBut you're you're first enclosure instinct is like that's my dad's my boy he's on my team I've got to protect them and defend him right\nBut that wasn't the case you know it was like the broad first went to protect Chris Paul the pull him out of it was so I don't know if he thought that would diffuse\nThis scenario faster or is it it just it is true colors show through and he's like yeah dude we go on vacations together you know our our family our friends and I don't want to burn disparate so where were you guys pioneer square\n[noise] uh no we're some some sports for like down the gun away from our own up\nMan pioneer square is fun man I'm over\nThere yeah where you're tired or square guy absolutely by the way it did so who is trying to fight Joe Davis who was that I wasn't Joe Louis guy with one of our crew would some random guy got some I I I only got ... again ... ... there was a story and then it was\nPassed along and I was thinking like All right what would have happened if I was there and like there was an altercation you know you ought to be really careful notice\nNow let's go live now to our violence on the streets of Inglewood insider bubble with the latest\nCenter actually okay um I Want to talk about the fact that no one's talking about the elephant in the fight I should say that when this all jumpy ... no [laughter]\n\nI said all of it and I'm thinking MBA player a giant sorry [laughter]\nIs talking about the fact that when it's all went down Lynch the\nWas the one who grab brand name ... voice how she was always the reason this entire scenario\nI Love I Love Carmelo Anthony afterwards also saying you know that that that stuff that doesn't even happen on the streets and you're right and you know it doesn't happen on the gun industry to use weapons okay you know nobody's speeding or throwing jabs they use tire irons and beer bottles\nI mean ... those places probably only come once it's random and then one in the defense is doing allow you the sack you the next time you try to do that 'cause they figure out different ways of rushing you but uh I I think when it's in your DNA like that you know you become and who've I always compare it into right now\nWhat older guy if I could ... to\nOh Joe Montana [noise] no I'm not quite so ... yeah\nAnd so so that's kind of who I see um his cop is and that's where I potentially see this going\nI'm the only difference being that I figured out a better team than Blake was when he first got the Jacksonville and he's got way more weapons and he's got an offensive by the coach who's you know really there to help him succeed so you know if he doesn't make this work\nHe's got no one to blame but himself because he's been giving the keys to all that\nA mat nag eighty coach for the Chicago Bears a step to the podium after the game and you would have thought that they actually won the game heroes coach ...\nThey look close and I just don't go up and I saw um catch the ball and uh I just couldn't tell exactly where he was how he came down with the extra effort was and then you can see on tape or just a little short\nAnd I just got done saying everything that happened to us everything that I just said we we were a yard away from time to a game take that and think about that for a little bit\nNow he's talking about the hell married at the end where Kevin White caught the ball and they got stopped at the one yard line I wasn't able to score doesn't it seem like New England always on the right end of every single play that that is sort of like that\nBecause there are better for those who wish it's amazing I mean the bottom line they're better prepared for every situation than every single other team and they have they been bodied that quota more teams you know lose games than when games they force more teams to lose game and\nThe patriots lost the turnover battle\nThey um they were more penalize them the bears are coming into the game they were one of the day I think last week the patriots I Believe weren't penalize and didn't pump the ball if I'm not mistaken that was that was an actual stats and the patriots a week ago and they lost both of those battles and they still won the game and the score may be seven points\nBut that was not a seven point came down the stretch my knowing them was a much better football team\nThey couldn't get consistent pressure on Brady and he just called them up down the field and by the way\nFor all the talk about Brady not having weapons and and wait to see I don't know what the update is on Sony Michel but it looked like a a pretty significant injury\nBut you could do a lot worse than Josh Gordon Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski to throat who didn't quite a bit yeah you could do a lot worse or the ... I think a Gordon's actually played a lot better than I thought this early in his in his time doing\nWhat he's been good they've got other guys to step up and Chris Hogan I think is underrated but um you're right that they've got some talent but at the same time you know Sony Michel really brought kind of a burst of the backfield has got some speed is a good runner they could really miss him 'cause as good as James what is\nYou know he's really who they like to use and catching the football is the fact that I'm not sure he could take a take on that number one role or the cowbell running back that we saw on Sony Michel like that could that could be an injury that if it's as bad as it looked\nAnd he's out for the season it really could impact them down the stretch\nOr he's ready to go and I'm just not so says Fox Sports radio as we come to your life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios batten down the hatches whatever that means and that get prepared because live that Jesus is on his way that's next year on Fox Sports radio\nTwenty eight teams theories\nOut changing marching Boston Red Sox running now\nDodgers on new champion sheep coming [noise] we're all over at\nFox Sports radio\nOkay Ben Mallory here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me and just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great rates and great service rovers Seventy five years\nAnd any time you need help you can speak to one of their training specialist twenty four seven the company is guy go go to guy code dot com today\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side is helping you see veterans rights they knew Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive smart milk ...

president I Do not believe that\nI think the main reason that Trump won the presidency and twenty sixteen and that Republicans will keep the house and when to keep the house and the Senate in about two weeks will be the fact that this immigration issue is going to remind Americans what's at stake in this election\nAnd or the coverage tonight on the nightly news and tomorrow or Monday Tuesday

we the American people can do to continue with more kind of live with you every Sunday [noise]\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agencies then we can actually began to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time does not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talent is a government because of the best reflects the will of the people\nIn reality at least for the past two years it was perceived Congress AS number one\nIt was perceived the president's number two and they and the court system is number three in reality number one is not the Congress one might say it's the President's Day is the most powerful\nNumber two is the current number three is the Congress the Congress is feckless foolish any relevant and and so what would the founding fathers day if they were transported from Seventeen Ninety seven to twenty Eighteen and October twenty Eighteen and they looked at the situation today what when the Congress is foolish and cyclists\n[laughter] I think it would be amazed amazed but when they studied it for a while I think they would understand why this happened and I think the reason is that the courts have given administrative agency is not the president and actually it's administrative agency which even the president doesn't control given administrative agencies\nSo much authority by passing laws that are very very general that are sort of goals oriented laws and that gives the agency's tremendous authority to make the major decisions that they should not be making Congress should make the major decisions the agencies should only be filling in\nThe details and owned unfortunately overtime because Congress has because the courts have not stepped in to stop this\nCongress has been encouraged to pass these very general laws then they go home to their constituents and they say you see I solve this problem for you and when the constituent complains about some new regulation that's come out the congressman says oh well I didn't vote for that\nThat's the administrative agency and what the what the constituent unfortunately doesn't recognize is that the congressman has to take responsibility has to be accountable for that because the congressman did not vote for legislation that restricted\nThe independent agency in what it was able to what he was able to produce the laws with just two general and what will happen now if the court access I Hope it will add you know\nIs that they will begin to look carefully at the underlying statutes and say this you did not have this authority you know you were not given this authority by Congress so you cannot make this rule that goes beyond what Congress intended\nAnd of course one of the things came up during the um during the hearings and the confirmation\nBrent Kavanaugh a couple of weeks ago was the fact that uh the United States Congress is exceedingly weak and not really a because they're so weak the liberals the progressive want to use the court system do impose like legislation\nOn way the American people because they're so unpopular whether it's gay marriage or abortion or whether it's immigration whatever it is there are certain things that are so unpopular in America and the Congress or foolish in fact was therefore they look toward the court system to be a second legislature\nAnd that was never intended by anybody in fact one might argue to go back to your original point\nAdministrators state is more powerful than the United States Congress\nAnd might be more powerful the most powerful branch of government isn't it is the administrative state something called the deep state that have been in existence for years if not decades and what they want to do is simply outlast as president and outlast the court and continue to exist so it is the administrator state right now more powerful than the Congress\nYeah I think undoubtedly it is it is making the rules that uh we live under and Congress was supposed to do that [noise] um and there is a way to address that and as I say and I think it's the courts where to step in\nAnd uh read the statute as they were written by Congress that would be able to say to administrative agencies you have gone too far and to the extent that they do that\nWe have some control over the administrative agencies and the effect that will be to force Congress to begin to act because if what the administrative agency has done is something that the American people would like\nAnd the courts have said no you weren't given that authority by Congress the American people will then go to Congress and say we want\nLegislation that does this um if it's something they didn't like then Congress won't be pressured and the agencies\nUm will will not be able to make the rule anyway but the point is we're a democracy\nAnd in a democracy the people's views should prevail and that's not what's happening and the under the current law system\nAnd give me an example and the four or five years ago\nObama was saying look I'm the president I'm not the grand potent than I Am not the dictator I cannot give dreamers certain rights to be in this country because the laws against that by by the time a president or run away president in my view Obama was a runaway president when he came to legal immigration\nAnd it just created new laws out of a ... that had nothing to do with the Congress and by the time that gets up to\nThe laws out of a salad there that had nothing to do with the Congress have all the time that gets up to the United States Supreme court and takes one to three years to even get there\nAnd in the meantime the dreamers have done what the dreamers are going to do and you may like or dislike what Obama is doing but at the president is set that through the eyes or ins\nThe president can do anything you once why why can't the next president doing anything he wants in other words it into substance it it's a rule making ability of the administrators state that ... that have been they've usurped the power that Congress\n[noise] yeah well you're you're correct as long as the courts and I'm here speaking principally the Supreme Court\nDoes not act one this is the Supreme Court lays down the rule yes I'm a that says this is the we are going to be reading\nStatutes as they were written a then it gives all kinds of people who are who would like to challenge administrative rules or even presidential decisions an opportunity to go right into the district court and get a ruling and what we've seen in the last\nYear many times is district courts have been making rulings against the Trump Administration and the reason they are able to do that is that the Supreme Court has not has not\nPlaced any kinds of strict limitations on what the court can do in fact what the what the Supreme Court has done in this so called Chevron case the central he said to the to the court you should defer to what the administrative agency\nAnd interpreting their own law yeah and that of course has given them license to do whatever they want\nYou know it has to stop I took home your book last night to read a ... page Ninety four\nI don't you have a chart beginning in Nineteen Ninety three which was not a long time ago I made like twenty five years Clinton was in the White House doing what Clinton do the White House but uh Nineteen Ninety three there were four thousand three hundred and sixty nine or rules forty ... rules which you know\nNow is a lot well and twenty Seventeen\nAnd the cumulative final rules publishing the federal register as a hundred and one thousand three hundred and eighty so it goes from forty three hundred under Clinton\nDo one on one thousand three hundred and eighty and it's like ... at the right at three to four thousand new rules every year and by the time and other ten years go by it'll be two hundred thousand rules\n[noise] well that's entirely possible the way things are going right now of course the hundred thousand a hundred and one thousand to kill me and that that number since ... since Nineteen Ninety three right um but yes it will continue to go on three thousand four thousand rules in any year\nBecause there is no discipline on the agencies right now because of this Chevron decision will Nineteen eighty four and because there isn't any a ruling from the Supreme Court\nThat says Congress cannot pass to the agencies its own legislative power that's a violation of the separation out of power in our country\nI Want to share of the American people on on the thought on page Ninety five you say one recent study found that the cumulative cost of regulations between Nineteen eighty and twenty twelve which is what a a thirty two year period reduced American economic growth by over twenty five percent\nWhich amounts to annually Thirteen thousand\nPer person in America annually and so this is gigantic it's huge it's growing and the only entity that can really stop it and the president can't stop it that Congress could stop it but there are photos and feckless individuals the only entity in the world that can stop it is not a state Supreme Court\nBecause can you imagine our economy twenty five percent larger because the ridiculous rules and regulations Jim another fact one one thousand three hundred and eighty it's now October twenty Eighteen I assume another three thousand rules going to go into effect\nSo unless Brett Kavanaugh and other four justices said this is unconstitutional it will continue well we got her on\nAnd Peter Jay well as in the book judicial fortitude the last chance to rein in the administrators state and Peter thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham show and you're a great American\n[laughter] that fact

G. F.\nUm couldn't be coming out of their uh otherwise world\nOr east Grand Forks the other teams like [noise] so ... in action on Thursday night in volleyball so there you go that's the volleyball set up ... said turn our attention to what we are very busy\nNight coming up tomorrow night in a football action we're going to carry it\nNight coming up tomorrow night in\nA football election we're going to carry that out of the teams that we follow in our immediate area on on the air we there's six ... six games that we would like to try to carry we can get at least five of those in\nWild at the time change for several of these games help 'cause a lot as far as coverage goes because we were able to get a few more games in than we probably would have been able to get in had some of the\nTimes not changed okay let's start with nine men then sorry and eight nine ... number one Steven our gal to Kelly north on three kids who got a central for his ... northern free seven like in the woods aid is one Alberta lost all yes how does that set for tomorrow\nOr I don't put the how to sex for tomorrow one plays eight to ... nine or two police evidence on and so forth Steven our guy will be at home tomorrow against the war in our law so that is one of the game\nTime changes as a that game will be a\nNow eight five o'clock game tomorrow evening a genius or it's a memorial field which means that they will be the early contests are kick off in our pre game coverage on the river falls radio sports then we'll come your way early with game time said for five it'd be bought for thirty five maybe even ... before that for a pretty in\nWayne will be rolling by four thirty Eli guaranteed it maybe new and we'll start at noon tomorrow marks or anything you want to make sure we get everything in along ... we'll all five o'clock games even our gal worn over the last ... in our guy and that\nGame will be on North Country Ninety nine three and we'll follow that on Ninety nine three with another game from that same a section eight nine man has kids have got any federal northern freeze will go out and head to head and ... and we'll have that game for you as well coming up but in action on sort of on Tuesday evening hail\nAnd and that's three versus six three the bear cats are in in how luck hosting the six team northern phrase freedom more competitive this year when they have 'em and kitchen kind of an up and down story they they started the year real rocky they settled in and started playing well they get that'd be towards the end a really kind of an up and down whoever shows up on his team\nType while the loss of being really cost him um or or or they had a chance to battle for that to see\nAll I don't I I think so too I Believe so to a shot at it but nonetheless they are three and they will host the northern freeze a also good range curricula Wayne or at seven o'clock will be hosting corporate conduct\nAnd they will have that game for you I Believe on twelve thirty Katie arrests\nAnd uh that game will be in good ridge are the chargers elites season loss also that affected their final seeds or or they were in a battle possibly for that number two seed to\nUh but that is the other half of the bracket the winner of that one will get Stephen are guile\nOr worn out would also be most probably Steven on Saturday I did talk with a with Kevin ... you know the activities director up at a Stephen ... moose morning just to let them know we're coming to the game and so on and so forth and he said that they have opted for the two o'clock game on Saturday if they went\nSo the number one seed gets their choice of the two o'clock in the six o'clock game and they have opted for the two o'clock game on Saturday afternoon\nWhich they have a number of years\nThat traditional and I told them we kind of expected that but that but that is what's what they've opted for so that's been confirmed and then the other half of the racket wouldn't be the case of the northern freeze winter against ... you're always homeland of the woods in a game that we played in Keller tomorrow evening\nAll right um and and again the winners move onto a Saturday or the afternoon as you just mentioned the evening a guess depends on high C doesn't it\nWell it'll be the second game will be at six o'clock right but we just don't know where it regardless if the seeds hold up it'd be a killer it would be a jet Kelly\nOr if the seeds don't hold up and the reason I just throw that in there because we don't have any but Kelly or we don't see them all year we don't get a really a chance to to gauge this team\nAlthough leg of the woods I think as struggled this year had they not do they have all Joe I'm there to insects going in so it would be at at a tough one\nMore than likely than Keller but that'd be and then of course the winters will be the Fargo to all twelve thirty in the first of November right yes that's correct okay so that's nine men action and the coverage we have as well on nine men in a a eight eight Wayne we're going to follow red lake county the rebels\nYeah would have been nice to have been able to cover to cover both rebels and badgering little river but a red lake county ended up winning the three way tie breaker Whipple county west and uh\nAnd also with ... yeah a really kind of in the best record at seven and one of the three but the three hit all beating each other and during the regular season so it came down to the tie breaker formula and and red lake God he wins a director formula so they claim the number two seed they will be at home that game will be an ugly\nAs they host red land they will host red lake\nSix o'clock start right in the the indications are that a\nBad game will happen AOL always some concerns air because much earlier in the year this year when red lake opted to forfeit the bedroom with little river\nA stranger things have happened ah with the ... but they were\nAmenable to the changing game time from seven o'clock to six o'clock\nSo that for all intents and purposes indicates that they have every plan an intention of playing that contest and and being a part of the action coming up on this tomorrow tomorrow evening\nGay and ... by the way the number one seed and and have been for a number of years a very strong team and that so everybody's got to go through with the building\nA year and the vet and could be a monumental\nTask effort like county does when a tomorrow they would play a Saturday Night at six o'clock at high speed I Believe right\nYes so which you've really got he wins would be that would be able to to\nSee how would they switched to read like falls go from all I Am wide rally falls I Am not asked\n... but I Believe that's correct yeah\n[noise] um and and if they were to win too then on the first of November like we mentioned with the nine man\nOr the championship ... played at the ... is that the last game eight o'clock eight o'clock is always the last game now gay so they would play in the last game they're All right a load on land in playoffs that let's go to a three foot ball and that is a deep river falls ... living in an extremely tough year this year\nHere early in the year so we say it's all kind of happening pretty quickly alright I go on on the road for most of most of November and most of December they don't play a lot at home in the in that sequence of time\nRight moving on to talk about the Vikings here a little bit and the ... the NFL but first I wanted to know to say I didn't bring up a uh the pioneers north of pioneers ended their football season since our last sports muggy show I was a scoring fast it was a turnover trashy turnover dating game I guess what the coach say on Saturday\nHe was frustrated with the lack of focus more than anything else but like she and I talked about on the year um [noise] the trick for coaching staff and and sometimes you can figure it out sometimes you can't even how to get your kid to focus in a game that means nothing 'cause the game and zero\nBoth teams were already locked in their playoff spots both to Africa and the and north when uh the game had nothing more than than bragging rights\nOr if they were to meet again they would end up meeting again in the state final which would be on a neutral neutral field because of pioneers or at home for both of their western division games in the opening round so in the opening two rounds of the western conference champions\nSo uh they were locked in to play at home for the first two weeks as long as they keep winning I'd Africa was locked into their situation as well as ... as far as position goes for the post season and it was just one of those kind of ugly floppy games too many penalties too many turnovers all things that will be addressed between\nNow and next Sunday when they play okay that's this coming Sunday right and wrong on from one week from yesterday okay so they place Sunday what time one thirty and they at least that's what I've been told so far okay so scheduled right now for one thirty game this coming Sunday and who did they play\nA Minnesota west again the team maybe just few weeks ago okay in a wild one that was fifty five or fifty six thirty six something like that and the wind means that come back again the following Sunday afternoon all the games are Sundays and uh and when they're put in like the is it like this kind of like the state the championship championship then and then\nEven when they're ... could possibly means some damage to the ballgame most probably yes All right\nSo they still got a few games they certainly could play yes which is pretty awesome ice ... said twelve forty two Katie are if if you have a question comment that you can text us on a piece at ten mark ... is our number while you're on north one stuff mhm uh the volleyball team plays at home this Friday and Saturday\nBut game times there have been adjusted a little bit\nBecause on friday night they're hosting section volleyball tournaments at north London mhm so are the game on friday of the three o'clock in the afternoon contest K instead of an originally scheduled six thirty game because they want to give room to given up on people in and out before\nThe high school people started showing up camp and then on Sunday they play a new or Saturday I mean they play then okay so us a friday afternoon and Saturday afternoon yes and they'll ... they'll play and their season they've still got a those are the Lionel secular was or their final conference games that right now they fit in to spot\nIt's more likely we're going to end up well depending on what happens with the final two conference games yeah I mean if they weren't leneghan both of them it would create a different situation for thought when they when the two what should we be way up and the two spot okay that's kind of what we're thinking there ... which means the following week they would go to central lakes the regional ...\nAll right I'm very good pioneers of we talked to a high school to talk to college or not we move on to the ah the pros at solve forty three Katie I read the Vikings played yesterday in the NFL or they pick up a when a and I'm feeling exceeded a hundred yards for the seventh yep straight game\nAnd as you know good for Adam Adam's having a great year and that's a that's a good thing a kid that was pretty much a\nNonchalant it out of high school and maybe even more so out of college\nEnded up by going to the Vikings and open an open tryout making the team and now a if not their number one receiver certainly than than their top two things this year he's been the number one you know I think ... I I I think he's the number one anyway because I think you can do more things and stuff on biggest can\nMean big say primarily use the euro long guy\nWhere the Lincoln do a lot more possession type things and so on and so forth which I think makes them more value in my opinion but a good for him I mean good for out\n... I'd like to be honest the two of the the better there's a a a good\nOne to combination here whether whether whoever you want to look AS number one where there's the letter digs there are two receivers on the same team they've got to be one in the top five in the NFL I've\nNot looked at the overall statistics but that we get pretty close they are I I Would think coast there I mean they're certainly got him\nTo run and do you use used your Smith who did the Pittsburgh I better doing quite well you've got the two guys out in the in Los Angeles for the rams lash\nThe undefeated team at like seven and all I think\nYou know and they got it done without one of their top two guys this weekend Cooper ... out but they were able to win again without him\nThey picked up another when um the uh here's on the saints are only one loss on the air and they beat the the ravens yesterday by one\nBecause the extra point was missed at the end of the game yeah I did I fly out of it is a Tucker\nTucker who according to the numbers had never missed the point attempt never until\nThis game and it came down to tying the game at the end it was either the final seconds right a regulation well yeah but even if even if he ties it um then you run the risk of the saints wanting to toss and Drew Brees throwing another touchdown pass so certainly but I mean because he ... he threw his five hundred ...\nHis first time he's ever Mr point attempt yeah you know couldn't have been during when they're up to you know leading and my three touchdowns couldn't it have been earlier in the game is anything but\nThe ... the game or the game played in London yesterday was decided by one because Tennessee one for two and the when instead of wanting to tie and didn't get it\nCharges one that gap or who are also doing very well I think they only have one last one or two hundred to last a they played all you're a Chicago Bears\nAlso they one or two hundred two laws are they played all your ah Chicago Bears or it could have done anything on special teams after they beat New England they didn't came close but did not be doing\n... killed them they they gave up by a kick returned protects down to the former Viking ordeal Patterson and then they also knocked the ball out of better since hand and end up scoring did they not bad but then they all ... let me finish in but don't they didn't they they they did cause a fumble yeah but then he Patterson okay and I'm not that one\nRight [noise] such wash\nYeah they did eventually went off at ... but I'm Talking about special teams stuff now my life you will ... will start talking about how this law so fighting schedule at all especially if you just said special teams that but I I was saying the score on a special teams play so I had\nTo come back on the score core Darryl took the ball back for a touchdown okay and then the other time they blocked opponent picked up the ... block ... so to special teams ... but\nYou don't even like the ... yeah yeah and they and they picked it up and walked in and scored the wasn't the ... coming back on the score and they leave scored on those special teams plays in both occasions if a if Chicago stops either one of those it's a tie\nAnd as it turned out that they came close anyway they've completely left Hail Mary pass the little one the guy just couldn't get the ball extend the cross the line or to to send a thing to do overtime or it might have\nBut ah Chicago I if I did some things and we'll begin to get some things well I kind of went back and forth between that game and the Viking game or throughout the afternoon\nA New England or I thought played very well especially when you consider that their top running back guy got hurt right away Sony Michel got hurt early in the game and it's and neither is the question is whether he'll be back or not\nHe certainly Mr remainder of that game that was a big blow for them\nOr injuries right now are starting to stack up for a whole lot of teams\nAnd his late ... and that is say that is changing the way some of these teams approach games ah you you look at the you have to for the Vikings and the jets I think the jets were missing three of their top five defensive backs\nSomething like that now I don't know if they beat Minnesota anyway even those guys are in the game I was the better team they were but it does affect the way your game plan\nAnd it does affect the way the opponent game plans against you or depending upon your injuries my bigger question would Minnesota is a wheel a TV as Murray has been playing although he did not have a great day yesterday I\nHad a couple of good ones he scored a touchdown on it was a thirty some yard touchdown\nBut he only had like sixty yards a whole game and you have thirty out on the one ... ... um the they did not run the ball merely as efficiently as they did the week before against Arizona of course has more though of course it varies on it so that's part of the reason and again I think their game plan change with the with the New York having three D backs loud\nAnd three new faces and their defensive backfield how that changes how your game plan but what I was going to say use\nAs well as ... has played if and when delving cookie is given the okay does he get the football or do you live ... but cook did play yesterday he was out for the game according to everything I saw\nA thought he ran double according\nTo what I saw and what is now before the game was his number because it came up as a fantasy football announce but that he was in\nA side to side too but I I also saw some of the replay yesterday I swore he ran the ball and they'd be a maybe\nWay being a better mood and find out\nThe kids today are empty River Falls in Ninety three point three FM Katie

I've seen a news articles\nAbout school board and city council and I I mean I'm just go off the top of my head but it doesn't seem like as many county boards have this kind of problem but it seems like I always wonder if the more you concentrate it the more you have people put together if they're more likely it is for people to have some more problems you know him\nAnd that can be I don't know

down there at staples Centre Saturday against Washington and the bench and but\nThat wasn't me or\nThe la Braun obey shouldn't when they first announced him at the game was big there wasn't any bowling because it wasn't as loud and boisterous as I thought it would be\nIt was the but would you agree well it yeah I Would agree with that but here's the thing remember during the national anthem\nLike toward no they show it on the end they showed him on the big screen and that was allowed to that was bigger than this year he got when he was introduced I thought it was so big that he drowned out the singer but but\nThey did did you agree that that was bigger than the introduction it sound like it but I was surprised when they find the way that he was the last ... or just trying to find out\nThat you can I Do I Need ... crazy during the national\nFrom asking you that's why I asked you I didn't just take it for me and I do that all of our of first things you can stand on there so that's what you guys when I came away didn't run much version of ... well\nAlso scored twenty four points one twenty two shots but we'll get to that I Would say\nHe has not played that will not you know I play by Brian James he can play well play well now and he's averaging twenty four I ain't going to have an ... it's All right he's playing well but by his he has not been the best player in the world\nNow for not at all how not by a long shot All right let's kick it off we got so much of a first as welcoming the odd couple crew as we always do because you know what Chris we wouldn't be able to do this fine radio program without him of course Rob GR producer\nAlix our engineer of course anchor Deb cautious who keep you updated throughout the show and I in turn Sean bail all on the other side of the glass Chris Broussard so let's kick some ass than this one day it is the odd couple and a large our men\nAre with the camera also in here with us or hanging out and we'll see stuff on a YouTube YouTube periscope not periscope Facebook all\n... everywhere where you can catch video the odd couple will be there so you definitely want to check that out and Rob I Want to get\nYour reaction the Dallas Cowboys lose again yesterday on the far west three and four I've that division obviously is still very much\n... or ... yeah I was up ... and I know the red skins are leading it but it's they don't have like the eagles are struggling gave up Twenty one points at home ... up in the fourth quarter\nYeah nah I hear you I mean Dallas obviously had a chance to win that game but they still clearly think they can win the division and they're clearly in when now mode otherwise why do you give up a first round pick desperate\nFor receiver a mark Cooper desperate now you know he's okay that looked ... does it become a probably because they're best receiver didn't stay in a whole lot\nIn saying what's on the plane he doesn't get you to another level in my opinion\nBut but this is as before we get there Chris if you're the cowboys and you'll run in the organization when they decided that they didn't want does Bryant and when they decided that written that once they realized Britain's retiring due date they knew they had to replace that position\nCome on seriously or whatever they didn't they didn't know they were kidding themselves ... whole way through so now you get desperate now the raiders or having a fire sale and you go oh my God he's available or what it will take and and of course if you're John ...\nAnd um [noise] uh the waiters GM um McKinsey regimen can take that you'll take an emerging hello pay what you say a first round pick a he's on his way\nInto her that that should have been a third round pit I'm\nPacking his stuff right now as we speak that much McKinley agree that's what I Would have said so so I think the cowboys are desperate they just keep looking at it saying what are we missing what don't we have we need a receiver they they they just uh they they botched this whole thing this whole season was botched\nWhen they lost two receivers that they counted on whether or not they still thought does was an ... number one or not and then when who as old as he was ready to retire to go to the broadcast booth which still productive player that that you got that that you lost\nSo you lost two guys and you born in a couple of guys who seven eleven and it didn't work out I mean seriously Rob I was saying he might get you a big gulp but they're not getting in touch down\nI said during the spring when the talk came out that they might get rid of the day they might cut him I said look\nUnless you replace them if you replace him because he's not a number one I said look offer him less money trying to bring him back on less money and see how that works but it never I never thought that they would just cut him and not replacing\nCut he may not replace them that they made no sense to me he's still if you were there today he\nWill be your best receiver plain and simple\nAnd you you now you give up a first mapping 'cause he was the gears\nAnd that's what's so bad about it when you say that\nIs you know they were dog and him saying how how he was and this was in that\nBut there's nobody else who stepped up on the cowboys no a methodology let's just be honest not at all of our fence they had the big blow\nAnd and obviously we saw a wood Jacksonville that or if it wasn't just the cowboys that you know anybody can score numb and beat them now yeah so so it wasn't that they didn't they didn't fix anything they come back the next\nNext week against Washington a struggle offensively\nThey all go eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six sixty three sixty nine give us a call\nIf you want to join the odd couple and share your opinion on this trade\nBy the Dallas Cowboys was it a move of desperation they got to you like it did they get robbed should've been they offered last a lower pick do you like what John ... is doing with the raiders or or what he's clearly I mean he can talk all he wants to about I'm not saying now is he going out there\nThere are so many things that go was to give you some information who\nAre you and what are you doing these numbers twenty four seven three sixty five\nWe trusted voice that make you smarter feels like you've never met with you're wrong so tell your friends\nYou only listen to the right here Fox Sports radio Fox sharks to think about that with attitude\nWill be season is here to drink and army because the only thing that matters is October [noise]\nThe world series begins tomorrow on TALK of streaming on Fox Sports\n[noise]\nYou're listening\nTo the ... roofs are ... you buy discover card discover treat you like you were ... we saw\nThe show talking about the cowboys and they gave up a first round is twenty nine theme to hopefully for a Mari Cooper wide receiver who they hope can strengthen they're receiving corps\nAnd even also Rob give them\nAn idea of what jak Prescott can do I think they feel like he doesn't have any weapons as far as receivers so let's see what he can do with a decent receiver and see if you use the guy that we want to\nKeep I think some of it is now it's starting to look at okay is that a guy we want to keep going forward with the are franchised quarterback or do we have to start looking for somebody and that right\nBecause you can use the excuse of not having any body you know what I mean he's a wise not doing it the real quick my nephew Albert his listen or serious okay in New York\nRead the top three lawns you just ticks me off the top three law by here\nSeven eleven joke was funny so he might not have you thought it was more than that of course he's going to think that\nWhat's the next line great opening that was the show very very energy from you both very energetic I assume you mean yes Portland by Elvis died last year though yeah he's still got out nephew that's what he's going to be he's always going to keep it real now for you to do was quoted he would say okay well let's\nLet's eight Seventy seven Ninety nine or ...\nAre you on hold up in

the speakers know or do not not not to the speakers and so we're we're going to try and figure this out\nI work on her [noise]\nOkay so it's obviously something to do with what your headphones monitors and so that's where I look to probably in what you're listening to All right so look ... monitors that's probably what to wear your problem ...\nAll right well I'm I'm guessing I'm On the air I don't ah here's a USO but I'll I'll guess I'm On the air you're on there [noise]\nOkay I ever got a ... well I'll tell you that is a at both these teams coming into tonight's a action this evening a knowing that the last ... regular season game as they get ready for a for playoffs and really it was kind of a final tune up\nFor these two teams are knowing that the no matter what happened to that I really probably wouldn't change where they would be seated now poll or section eight eight they said tomorrow and it looks as of right now that a red light Comedy Central most days there on the east side\nThey are and right now the forest spots and it does look like they'll probably end up in the force by that gets Boston won\nA and then there is a lake of the woods and then ... and then number four regret like county ... looks like they will stay there it didn't matter what happens if they would stay at the force by\nAnd what that would mean is they don't have to play the playing game on Mondays being for the first time in many years now they don't play that first round they will go right to Thursday and they will get as the number four seat if it indeed stays that way\nAs a force feed your host the five seed what's right now it looks like it's probably going to be hosting when a Mac next Thursday night so tomorrow will be filed they'll they'll have decisions tomorrow so we'll know tomorrow but it doesn't look like mustangs ah we'll probably have a home playoff game next Thursday night or the like like what am\nTonight they be won over the last three games to none but it wasn't as easy as three games to not they were three matches or three ... there were a whole host in this match tonight in fact\nThe lawyers really got role and they got rolling early they took a big lead they ended up winning sent three twenty five Thirteen so they've got the problem is really a little bit except that in that third set the warriors lost their best player\nCaitlin ... or ...\nOr by far the best hitter for the world and lawyers and whenever they needed a big point tonight that's for the when she didn't want every team mates got tied up on a scramble for all\nBy that three quarters of the way through that third said they went down and eat to the floor Caitlin bounce teary eyed a boat monster or head off to the gym floor\nI watched it when they got their feet and she was noticeably ... at that point people were balls used their second time out to try and write the ship a little bit it was like twenty to Thirteen at the time\nAnd a\nWrite in that range anyway and got lost the game over the bench and sat down teen idol she talked to one of the assistance when it was decided\nThat she was done at least for the remainder of this at\nThat point a couple of other players that Madison fish among them took over for the lawyers and they won the third set twenty five thirty eight to one and we go to the for the\nLast ... not come off the bench to start to pour that people were all put their foot on the gas they jumped out six to one\nAnd then they open it up even bigger it was like twelve to four\n\nAnd when he got to be I bought the team to eat or nine right in that range I coach Brecht in Boulder plastic gun out of the ... and put a lot of feedback yeah\nNow she was noticeably skill unsteady\nI don't I Will say she has a good thing because I'm not a doctor I don't try to play one on radio\nBut\nShe did not have the same energy she had early in the end the match and I just did not he got a couple of gills made a couple of points bowls that before she was early\nAnd it probably just kept the pressure on and they won the third the worst thing going away\nThe wins by three steps to one margin and claimed victory this evening like I said that women give the Palestinians their regular season\nBut it gives the others they should anyway when the seats come out a home floor advantage in the first round of the playoffs with your next week Thursday now the seeds aren't done until Sunday in a two way because there are teams still playing on Saturday and a couple of tournaments better laugh\nI Know a world goes down to a tournament burgers fall\nBut people were calling the has done and they're done in a big way with a big win that should get them home for advantage in the first round of the playoffs fathers also keep docked in a normal starter\nGenerics him did not even drafted CDC pulled a muscle in her leg sometime this past week and they held her out tonight\nAnd went with Katie Nelson in the first couple of cents then in the fourth set they want without heavy weight in that spot and the combination was enough to help the ... to victory this evening big night for the fall I highly offered to you they just by wanting to kill Mr double double\n... guilt and service point a Matty get should end up back to where where did you get the net on blocks and blocks kills a big service night also brandy rose and do as a fever of ... got to go on early and often this evening and when I have three seven to one margin to take to victory in er in home for advantage to postseason\nOkay when as we get ratings in the post season now using [noise]\nSure insurance ... a a home loan match coming up next week next Thursday I look at the standing there is a north than from the south how do they run the playoffs\n... do you play with in the north have for I Believe it's the first two rounds venue cross brackets\nOkay All right so is there a chance at a scene from her falls would actually host ward wrote in the first round [noise]\nHi it's possible the one thing there though is the more ... cooks been ended up close on war road have the director there because they beat the pirates\nOkay All right I understand why\nThey did not cooks can be more roads that probably will probably be drugs that\nSmoking so we we play encouraged to\nThe world one tonight because they all would have beat each other more along the river falls trucks that would have eaten war wrote and people were falls would've beaten drugs to write and then the next tie breaker is\nBeginning percentage in the section and I think the ... what a drop all the way to six so this was a big win from that standpoint you went from being the only game in the first round did not have to play and not having to play ... in the first round\nYou know you look in the evening\nIf you look at the north has standing roses going again number one minute God you've got five or six teams uh there's hardly anybody and that's actually overall for five hundred in the whole uh nor the standings on the north side of the section doubling\nThat rule so it's a clear cut favorite they they have the best year of all the teams um but you know you look at the river falls they're winning record they're winning percentage of them very good but they've had a lot of really close match that they've lost three one and in one of those three sets they battled and took it the extra\nPoints or they've lost three to ... you know that type of thing so so they had opportunities big just not been able to finish them being able to finish tonight and not let world bounce back after winning ... percent were very big for the GOP\nOkay and the CD meaning is tomorrow [noise]\nNot offered to weigh it won't be till Sunday\nOkay so they wait until the end of the week so they must be other teams\nBe till Sunday okay so they wait until the end of the week so they must be other some still playing yeah Eric tournaments okay\nSo you gotta wait for that so we won't find out until probably one Sunday Monday [noise]\nYeah I won't be official official but everybody I talked to like documents beer Meyer today on the way up here just to clarify things and he's on the district committee for the bully and he told me that's the way he understood it okay to Providence won tonight they would be an on\nGoing well that's good news so\nI I unless we both totally don't understand that you are up which is\nWhy\nI that's the way we gotta figure right now is it probably will have a home game and the first round\nI dodged the same thing about mark Martin about the same thing with these two teams and he's on tonight for allergies and they had a lot of close matches that a lot of close to that [noise] are they going to be razor playoffs next week\n[noise] why they don't have any choice but to be right that time you you either you either put up or shut up at this time of year on and they you you either are ready to play\nOr you're not a lot of it for me I especially in the first round playoff games comes down to outback drew seniors want to play one more time and it probably does have an for seniors honesty\nRight so you know how bad do they want to play one last time\nThe uh the nine\nMartin Gallagher the are the heroes and dolls I\nThe other sees the back of the leaders on this team and so on and so forth but how how much how badly they want Matty Ice yet how bad they did they want to take one more time I've probably volleyball player you that and they asked if only they can make that decision nobody else can\nOkay we'll probably get a big victory tonight [noise]\nThat very big win for\nProbably the ... and you get anything on them\n[noise] she's fought in the squad last I Do not have spores okay\nIt was a very early night or roads tonight I walked in about twenty after five in the squad was done already\nThe GED game tended at about ten minutes after ... ... as if he falls on twenty five Nineteen twenty five five well\nAnd they held the or the varsity max about Fifteen minutes before they even started their pregame ceremony which included that Jack Reed college age students do other things\nBefore they actually started a twenty minute warm up to be getting closer to a normal start time but that's that's part of the reason we were done for you know we played for sex and we were done by thirty five forty nine\nAnd that's why I look at the scoreboard here nine guns on the air here and we have known scores are really starting to get them now but yeah you were done earlier none of money for the lions [noise]\nYou know and that was most game and everything yes\nI Am in fact right now I'm almost the badger [laughter] [noise]\nYou know the home early that's good though and and I'm not hammering it I'm driving on at the speed limit because I don't want to meet can be you know there's a lot of them up there\nI've been driving through smoke people are burning wood bio\nAh was drying up to do that [noise]\nYeah so it it is interesting players or it should be a wait and see the moral against everything kind of shakes up there is some things that could happen so but it does look like a yeah after tonight now that ah the more now but also probably going to the fold into play the northern freeze them if they play new folding\nHolder Carlson I'm guessing when new fold in but I suppose to be decided between [noise] ah [noise]\nThe ah Marshall County central and try and county as to where it gets to play but I'm guessing I\nThink that's probably already been pre determined in Catholic good restrict what being an only know that can bring\nYeah yeah so that's the way um yeah so Goodridge Goodridge curriculum more than likely going to be a hosting red light falls northern freeze hosting worn over the last ... clinic says you're more than likely in in the west side anyway I've\nRead like off is going to go to good rich critical then we'll just have to do Monday Night\n[noise] uh that's that's the way it's kind of looking right now\nBecause red lake county ... the first round by the\nYes they are more than likely we're going to force feed which means that they would host the five seed when a Mac or probably in Oakland Thursday\n[noise] yeah where we have all kinds of no room for you\nTo be a busy night on Thursday\nOr what we can't possibly cover everybody we might as well tell people that now because you'll have even are going on you'll have get the guy central probably get back to reimburse bill river\nYou'll have ... central at home [noise]\nYou'll have either the northern France or war in Alberta last saw an ad on the\nRoad [noise]\nOr more in Alberta last saw at the\nRoad [noise] sat somewhere while they're that they're going to be I don't remember what number that well that would have an eight\nThey are a name [noise] it would probably be ... even our guy I'm more than likely by I Believe if if it stays that way northern freeze worn out but also it properly winter would would go to Steven are guile\n[noise] and then you're good regular ethnic all winter would probably go to\nSacred Heart right yup yup [noise]\nSo\nYou know that that all of a sudden we Sacred Heart even our guy out I be GM are a red lake central and all yeah people the\nAnd the fervor false and so we we don't have enough stations unfortunately\nWe don't know they just going up people\nAnd that was added

Sunday because there are still some games on Saturday in tournaments they put it back on the final two way\nAnd now the small ones because they are still play yeah yeah um\nBut that and that was and I didn't know that either I thought that was the last night and then a\nRed color was telling me that that ... bay one tonight there again or gets off the experiment it would be ... because it would affect their overall winning percentage which could be that big wedding airs icebreaker because\nPeople were all going to war and World War II\nMass so it's good thing that people were falls one tonight that ended any of that question\nYeah it sure did the biggest thing now is is that it could get close enough to be in the director to get by war wrote ... or\n... and I cooked in beaver falls on a Thursday night otherwise it'll be more Wayne was earning a\nScores you are you talking about that could change spots will ever be news in volleyball tonight 'cause I'm just getting some of these

and on and on sort of brilliant I'm kind of forensic approach to the child no no\nButton guy but it was the person who decided in Nineteen eighty one or two that\nThe CIA needed to know whether the information was coming from they need to know\nWho was the British spy that was producing this great\nAmount of material because the Brits were passing along this stuff\nTo the CIA but they would never say where it came from that kind of one of the conventions in in international kind of spy craft as you don't give away all souls and so and my six would never explained the CIA where it came from and button ... among others felt\nThat they need to find out they need to find out who it was that was producing inflation and so they began to trying to launch their own investigation into the

an American a double agent ostensibly working for us but actually working soon to be working for the Soviets I mean that reads like the plot out of a novel\nWhat seems completely unlike the doesn't it but it is I suppose one of the things that he showed in the house of espionage which is that it's all about is that you know it's all about kind of double crossing really ... and older changes the fact that he figuring all sorts of ways I mean he he did it for money but\nBut you know he's been a a an officer of the CIA for very long time and he knew a lot of secrets and he clearly\nKnew the

game\nA so always every chance I can get\nObviously I got to get back to do the show right when I got a little you know pre game and that's when you get to talk to people and find out what's going on the debt and was able to watch the first inning before I came back to the studios here so it was a real good and you got to another good game was on the other barn burner and this is\nChris this is the game I made his game five must do the Dodgers yeah the winter because you're going back for two and a walkie\nI think the winner of this when the series I think it just about well obviously Milwaukee will still have a decent shot going they will live when he was a game but they certainly Dodgers have won in the Dodgers were white but the Dodgers split yeah there so it's not like they didn't win an automatic by not no not at all but uh yeah big show for us today\nSo much to do and now let's welcome in an odd couple of course we always do because you know what Chris we wouldn't be able to do this fine radio program without the we wouldn't know and\nDollars will come and Rob G A producer\nAlex or engineer or Ankara Deb Carson yes our intern Kyla we've got you and I'm a larger are always comes in every so often any ah take suits us for a a face not Facebook or\nYouTube periscope right you do all over owes us all over the place so every but they're all on the other side of the glass so you know what Chris Broussard let's kick some national news when\nOur right some days you say that better than others now some days you're saying with the rhythm that where it's like a rhyme other days you just say I just said [laughter] like I'm just letting you know what to do like it now I like that that show law that she'll call me cars are significant works good catch phrase now I Know\nPeople don't realize the other people on the other side of the glass in the radio and so we're in one room there and another\nAnd that's right and this Thomas Mapp let's do it has to do it well look you were out there Dodger Stadium you got to see Clayton curse on what was certainly a big\nA performance for him big day and he's gone six on is is that they have they relieved him yet but he's gone six innings gave it up one run as you said it's tied at one only three hits so nice out even by curse shot and he\nWas in a little trouble we had a second and third or and they got yellow ... out and I think Braun right uh yeah so so he wiggled out of it which could have been\nA big spot but so far you write in a big game he's got this team in the mix it's one one ah nobody was looking for him to pitch a no hitter Chris or or complete game shutout just the pitch a good day or many gives them in ... when it so that's what he's done\nWell the question is before the game you saw a lot of articles on this and you will see this anytime the Dodgers are in relative trouble or you know in the rest of the way if they get to the world series in throughout Everytime he takes the mound\nPeople are going to wonder is this the last time you see him in a Dodger uniform and can opt out after this year this could be\nHis last started Dodger Stadium yeah you know like today they were fans talking about it\nI was in the crowd you know walking around and people were like you think this is the you know asking and I was like they could be I mean sometimes you don't think about those things but when you add it all up say the Dodgers were to lose and then they go to Milwaukee and losing ... play again\nThen he could opt out and he wouldn't be done in Los Angeles\nHave you gotten any sense from whether it was some of the reporters who were talking to if you talk to anybody and the Dodgers organization or even from what fans may be thinking of you getting any sense\nFor the feeling of whether the Dodgers intend to bring him back I mean obviously they want him back at a at the right price but are they willing to break the bank 'cause I think he makes\nIs he going to be thirty five million that he would opt out of what it says coil does that he's going to obviously be looking for a huge payday so do you think the Dodgers are looking like hey no matter what it is we're bringing me back up\nI'm just telling you as how hard it is the get pitching and I get the frustration of courage show when it comes to the post season don't get me wrong your Dodger fan you're sick over the idea of Christ that you have\nOne of the greatest pictures of our generation white world Dodgers look for him no question that you didn't get a World Series the Dodgers have won six straight\nAnd was divisions okay there have been in position to to get there to win and it just hasn't happened last year they won seven games with the Astros and it didn't happen so the point really is\nDo you want to go back to the ... and it's been Thirty years since they've won a World Series but what do you want to go back to where you're not even in the mix\nWell that's the one they lose ... he wasn't there a best picture this year no not this year but in previous I of course previous years but you know you're looking forward is he going to be your age\nI'm going to give you the example that I'll give other people I mean that I've given other people everybody thought that are just in Berlin was finished dinner ... okay and what is the tigers do they move them\nTiger is it going this way Chris goes south and you're like going out and just in Berlin to help with the world series for the Astros and ...\nAnd he's huge now and he's here now in great\nSo it's always one of those things you know I still had an eighth can have a couple of murky years but it doesn't he's not old or anything like what he's done and you're like oh well he's forty years old you should get rid of now\nI think you got to be careful when you're talking about a guy when you put a guy that caliber out every fifth day Chris you always have a chance to win and you know what you also don't have you don't have eight and ten\nGame losing streak right because every time he goes out there you got a chance to win and that's how good teams are built that's really why good team because they don't lose eight in a row they don't lose ten in a row there's no way you're gonna beat him twice in two starts you know what I mean\nIn this day and age he so unique because we've seen great pictures\nYou know who who are great for three four years then and then whether it's injury a lot of guys we saying go to new places and they don't pan out big time for ages get paid you yell wherever you are Santana up his

Shaw\nYeah your thing I think that I think there's a chance that he could uh because like there are enough teams out there for desperate for them to the rotation starting pitching that they might not give her more than thirty two and a half million a year but they might go up there you're on the ...\nOr or or if you're on the deal and he might consider you know taking something like that so I guess is in the end the Dodgers curse all work something out whether that's adding to Europe or maybe keep it at a true you're but maybe you know a set it up a little bit for the two years where\nHe feels like it's getting a premium for the next year before he goes to create the so\nI I my guess is that that they'll make a deal before he gets to the opt out and then he adds up stand a Los Angeles\n... let me ask you a lot of people you know do they get frustrated with coach draws postseason a we know he's one of the best pictures of our generation that we've seen especially during the regular season and and see just till ... people how hard it is to get a guy\nAnd and see just so ... ... people how harder to get a guy like that\nAnd to give them up and the example I gave up was the the tigers finally gave up on Bert land or you know could you had a couple of down season then he turned it around got healthier and help the Astros win a World Series so isn't it hard to give up on on a guy like curse of cultural\nYeah I think I think it's you know where you are and the time and place in your ... your stations also the tires\nYou don't give up on earlier but they're going to rebuild so they figure you know what why why have 'em here are paying that money if if he's got to where those tapes that aren't going to mean anything is so they thought they were to restock their farm system as a way to go the Dodgers have a pool expectation of competing at twenty Nineteen twenty twenty\nOr and so if they do keep a curse off of who is still a front end of the rotation\nHaving less philosophy that says ask like getting your strike out with your ... is he still is an elite level pitcher or if it's not here are gonna have to replace them\nAnd there's not an obvious replacement out there on the market this off season so you know that all has to play into the decision for them or you know that's an elite level pitcher that it's going to be very tough to replace\nIf the ... Parker we're joined by Steve ... catch him on the lead off by radio show seven to ten eastern time in the morning on the email be network radio in addition to ... the big summer for free agents Manny Machado Bryce Harper\nWhich of these guys do you think we'll get the biggest payday this summer in which guy should\nYou know it's interesting I I Would ask that question a year ago a that Bryce Harper will get the biggest contract up but as it stands right now I actually think that the child has got a chance to get the bigger deal ... uh and I know there's all this stuff about you know that he can't get a ... foot at first base and\nYou know he didn't hustle on this plane and people are making all kinds of judgments making about ... villain a he's a lead level infielder you play shortstop or third base\nA factor in of itself I think is critical uh and I think that that he's the ... the ball player the thing about Harper is is value is really difficult to quantify you don't want to go through an odor and he says listen I Want to give this guy thirty million a year for ... years you're going to go okay well tell me he is now\nIs he the guy that was MVP where's the guy who took forty right you know I Know walks a lot but what is is a player I Need to better understand it because he's the analytics Kai Wright is his value is\nIs there but you got to kind of look at the numbers of the different way for her for\nFor ... for the pure old school baseball player not so much on base percentage but he's going to give it a ... year the production and it's going to give the defense so\nI think what child will probably get the bigger deal than it may be that Harper prefers maybe something a little bit shorter did he have another monster season and then go to the hope to capitalize on that long term deal\nLasting Steve and we've got about a minute up the managerial situation in major league baseball with all the analytics and a lot of the older managers couple of years ago we saw a a job fair old dusty Baker and Joe Jr already all guys who were in the playoffs get\nGet groomed out and uh now you know social and and buck Showalter are they both got fired all those guys are going to be able to get a new job or are they going to the TV analyst and guys who are all into the analytics in and relate better to the younger players\nYeah you know just seeing I think that I think we may very well see ah I think we'll get a job and I really do I don't know does really so you will\nUh you know buck Showalter wants that he could be an analytics manager he's got that sort of mindset of what we are seeing that transition it's the other part of it is they're all bets are guys but they're also the high money guys why all got let go because organizations do not value or manager of the same way they used to\nIt so if they come back we're going to have to accept and they're going to get paid nearly what they did in the past\nI highly valued ally ... job we appreciate it and we'll get you on down the line and don't forget to check out his radio show delete all spot seven to ten am eastern on M.

that happened to go out there do good show so oh the precedent media there was only ... up put\nStories out about that that boy so we were kind of under the radar all these years and uh I I kinda like

a lot of his television specials and a Jackie Gleason dean Martin the Jerry Lewis and we were in that realm we were\nKids doing rock and roll or being that boy so I I like the fact that we had a clean

wild granted\nNobody's cheering but maybe the a and R guy behind the window but but you could do take twenty eight if you need to to get a perfect and so I'm curious which did the Letterman prefer the studio perfection or the on the road live spontaneity\nWell you know I'm probably the worst interview were in the world is if you eat in the world is on the very positive guy I don't look to the negative and they think so when it comes to a question like that Mike I answer is I prefer both\nBecause it does if you're in the studio for a month or so and then you're on the road from it gives you

I don't know like a maybe a a Broadway musical or something I'm just curious\n[noise] yeah you know those are always wonderful things or if it would be great to have\nLike the ... you know the four seasons have a show here again of course they were controversial were they were very\nUh offstage it did some things but yeah well I'll tell you what ... not really young because let me tell you one thing back in you know the first men on the moon\nArmstrong and John Glen in on the altar and well yeah a Armstrong his it was a big fan of the letter and and his wife was a really big and so when they won\nOr lost to the moon is the first man to the moon Armstrong he they have this little plot they weren't sure if the tours in a word that they had in their capsule they would choose the music that they wanted to hear just in case he got stranded up there for a year and\nThe capsule and they call the doctor but so what happened was he a chill if he gets for\nLetterman touch with him and

I Believe a fraction became or or certainly interacted with an overlapped with with a tip\n[laughter] and they effectively I I guess gotten the chance to\nReview those those beliefs and those hypotheses within government we've taxpayers' money and and that of course gives us in an interesting opportunity to find out about ... because\nWas often an interesting opportunity to find out about this because I and I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but now of course talk of congressional hearings to to get to the bottom of that but\nBut the bottom line drawn the question is is that I think there was a believer ... they made them move they came up again some wrote a couple of different right blocs one right ball with they simply go to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigate it but because they didn't get a definitive on\nThe feeling was but they taking it as far as as they couldn't what else can you do\nThe other sort of blow up but they had this very controversial later\nI called it a religious road block from from senior people in the Pentagon who frankly for the UFOs from the paranormal with him on it and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do\nWell what do we\nDo we won't have anything to do it\nI mean um it it was started the whatever the it was but I I as I say that there were people\nIn the beginning probably still all who who's deeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing with that they don't make a demonic phenomenon here might come uh come up again is there for a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my bosses was um\nUh she you know they're pretty extreme with the S. and in the the the individual who wrote that the classified\nIntelligence assessment on on UFOs in the ministry of defense\nCarried name project ... he would have wanted to go too far down that road he had some play the old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book of Asians I think it is where it refers to say as being the print the power of the air and I think is where a lot of these conservative religious people ... the idea of UFOs might be demonic\nCan just you know and there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and and it\nIt it's frustrating you know than because and and it's almost ... ironic in another way that you know you have a bunch of people\nIn in the cod that the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in a proper scientific manner\nAnd we come up against skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect um but that skepticism isn't the sort of [noise] they Nicole or intellectual a human they kept a system but I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it it it's a ... probably trying to believe or tripping skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the pen picking 'em\nI say that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic well it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another so really these by\nThese people were skeptical told they will leave but they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back and chat more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can get show updates and connect with other coups tunes when you're doing the ... billion Facebook page just go to preschool dot com slash goes to go see him and the like button [noise]\n\n\nAm twelve thirty J.

I defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represent a threat not the only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate piece represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this this gets quite interesting because ah parts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media and the public know there's just no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if that\nOf any defense in ... but no no no threat and yet in the way they were classified documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper assessment and so we we can't tell\nYou simply can't sell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of threat\n... it would be if\nWe could absolutely\nSay that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions\nAnd and an other misunderstood\nPhenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like bought Hopkins type Jacobs where we're always saying\nYou know that this whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual view of this\nTalk about healing and things like that and he goes back to the idea of who who can really say and I know this sounds bizarre but in millet treat 'em\nThere is actually in a way Asian\nFor I'm working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge or robbed of this this\nIs a kind of them we don't know the values but intelligence some military sickles\nWe say that ... is defined as being a a construct of capability plus intent\nSo so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count ways of the ... and if there is\nWhat ... what kind of a threat it is well we have some idea about the capability of you ate pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files state like clearly you know pizza maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything but then we've got so the capability\nWe we know has a higher value what we don't have any idea about his intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once\nWe it may be unknowable in the u._k. the astronomer royal to march in race\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said it may be trying to approach to try and figure this out he said it might be ... the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics\nAnd you can find the well we don't know what it is we don't know what they want but can you categorically scenic that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I don't know that\nBut I mean visitations visitation\nWell what I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that\nYou a pay a rail that they do routinely penetrate are already defined\nRegion I'm In the u._k. the U. S. and presumably elsewhere and\nThey all seen by pilot stay on track to him right on they performed speech and maneuvers\nThat we can't match so in that sense yes this is a real phenomenon and of course we've now seen which brings us back to the tip story we've now seen those declassified videos of of navy F. Eighteen super on its chasing some of these things\nNow is a matter of fact let's talk about the navy jets what's your take on\nWell so far we've got three three videos I'm a pretty amazing do\nYeah I absolutely I if I sat down and watch these things with\nUm pilots with I I've actually being in a situation where I've I've I've watched these things and been sitting around a table with with a commercial airline pilot and I'm retired military pilots and we've we've and the surrounding\nAnd nobody's saying that this is his bike or anything and of course of course it's it's\nNot um [noise]\nWe don't know again and I I'm not one of these people you know sometimes I listen to to people being interviewed makeup announcer for everything [laughter] I'm sure you've probably interviewed a few of them they don't want to name any names I Hope you will\nWill respect the fight but I'm not afraid to say I don't know\nWell I Do because you're not a skeptic by any means but your research or in a in a darn good one in the same that you don't know that's fine with me\nYou I mean I'm not no I don't think time I'm a skeptic ... a a ... I'll I'll believe everything kind of\nPerson and again let's be honest they're all they're all quite a few in this field I mean the real real life in my experience of looking at this government the real real situation is is far more complex than than real or not real and skeptics\nVersus believers and the idea that there's ever going to be one solution to the U.S mystery is is I think\nYou know crazy I I just don't think it's going to pan out that way but\nYou know crazy I I just don't think it's going to pan out that way\nBut but to go back to your question yeah we've seen those three videos um we know that there are a more videos in science I think will be something that will come over the next\nFew weeks and months there is always the pressure going on behind the scenes to say well come on this doesn't happen in a vacuum these sorts of incidents have been going on for years\nUm we have a number of pilots on the record talking about this there must be many many more videos Lou ... has said that there are other people involved\nIn in bold less have said that there are ... of course none of these people\nWant to preempt ... the DOT or the CIA and and any other agencies involved might decide on this I mean I think if if people start talking about stuff that's genuinely still classified and the government hasn't released those people will end up getting a knock on the door\nWell we've heard that happened before haven't we [laughter] yeah\nWhere do you think your thoughts are on President Trump's request for a speech for\nWell it's it's it's interesting and it certainly caused more than a few\nRumors and conspiracies I I guess in one sense I'm not maybe I'm not surprised and maybe I don't think it's going to\nAs big a deal as as some people do I mean clearly that the United States Air force hats has um it's space came on so it's not as if it's not as if\nThe military has some known for a long time now that there are going to be to future battlefield and ... spaces\nCongress considers strange illness primarily apprentice on Capitol Hill senators are talking about ways to respond to the presumed murder of a U.S based journalist including cutting off arms sales to Saudi Arabia correspondent Linda Kenyan has laid\nIt and try to show new reluctance to put on ... on the table\nBut there are other things senator said that the u._s. can do to send a strong message to Saudi Arabia senators pointed out for example that treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin should not attend an upcoming economic summit in the Saudi kingdom called ...

it's a great a point which is of course he goes back to this this thing that I think a lot of people in this field do no\nI'm the idea that this phenomenon suddenly started in Nineteen forty seven is of course crazy I mean people have seen strange things in the sky since the dawn of time but I think the other interesting thing about this this cold and these these familial\nRecollections is is the fact that you know these these phenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and culture and it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this\nThis thing is is almost commonplace that it's it's like oh yeah you know that that's the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real miniature Israel\nWe don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real\nAnd it sure is real let's go to Andy in Norwalk, California now Hi Andy go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi George you're a great patriotic and Mr call it's a real honor I listen to many times and you're very um [noise] informed and entertaining to listen to um I have two part question if I may uh first of all a based upon all of your knowledge of um [noise]\nThe western powers all of the NATO countries them for that matter and let's say the eastern bloc countries ... how many ... as long as you've been following this how many uh aircraft and uh pilots had disappeared and this guy while pursuing so called UFOs\nAnd are based upon your response I I have a second part a final question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were going to hit me with pot too straight away\nWhile we're waiting for the world will be down there aren't one\nI'm now I'm going to found a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say the on three is less than than a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and tentative belief communities I mean I've\nSeen some people talk about pilots going missing and and you eh fires and I think\nYou know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous\nUm occupational certainly laws in in the early days in a lot of lot of egg Croft just disappeared because they crashed now now of course then you have\nDo you have some kind of see cases like a ... ... the mentality case we he didn't disappear of course but he crashed chasing a UFO which skeptics say with the planet Venus we coming off of cost to the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most\nFamous disappearance of all time involving a UFO Frederick ...\nOh yes and that was strange I think we're literally don't use the way in Australia right\nYes I absolutely over the or is it by trade I think all the time has been\nStraight maybe the bass straight is part of the past month say excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but um but I I don't buy into the room as that that I've heard the pilots were were\nSharing and disappearing or all the time as a result of of that we had a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just flew his car off into the sea\nIn Nineteen Seventy it was during a night exercise and some people years later I tried to attribute a UFO\nA story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry file which was about two inches thick I went through every single pipe in not filed and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these UFO rumors so I think I think the ... the question is is very few\nVery handy okay go ahead and they say oh okay so the second part question based upon your your response to this\nUh as you probably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft that we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the skies\nAnd uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order\nTo a stop to pursue the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich before he passed away a Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes [noise]\nAnd I asked them what are the chances of\nA life or not existing on other planets and knocked coming and visiting us um and he said impossible that that was his response impossible [laughter] so I I appreciate your perspective I Do personally believe\nThat they dominate the skies any time and every time that they come a within our airspace there's so many thousands tens of thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years ahead of us they could be entered the mention all they could be physical or both\nBut I don't think we're much match and they do have air superiority and [noise] I Do appreciate the honor and pleasure but talking to both of you\nIn the Persian and well said by the way and you know\nAnd he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British Intelligence is Aspen ... and that was a I\nI don't like to call it amusing\nBut ah I it was kind of\nPoignantly amusing maybe\nThe ... there was a line about the flight safety and safety implications\nOf U. A. P. C. which goes directly of of course to the point just made and there was a recommendation in ... combines final report and it said I don't have it in front of me but but effectively a pilot's encountering you ate pay should take no action\nApart from trying to place the object is done in other words you know whatever we dealing with here don't mess with that\nDon't mess with it at all we're going to take a break pretty soon that can come back with funnel phone calls but I also want to talk with you you've done a thriller out called blood brothers don't you\nYeah I Do a\nKind of a different thing for you\nYes I I'm a big although I'm best known for having run the UFO program\nI did a lot of other things in my Twenty one years at the MIT and my final posting within the direct threat to defend security we did a lot of counter terrorism and things I've written fiction before I've written to siphon novels about alien invasion\nSo I decided to write to a thriller about terrorism and counterterrorism and the intelligence agencies it's our turn Kendall now and uh it's it's going straight\nTo a paper by going I think November fifteens\nGood luck brothers that's the

our final segment with Nick Pope of course huge part of the aliens up the Pentagon filmed the DVD as well in his latest book is an action thriller called blood brothers and how do you get the book Nick\nWell its own chemical at the moment I'm a I'm coming out in paperback in November but it's on Amazon so so basically I just go get dramas and look up blood brothers Nick Pope or it's on late Nick ... website on the books\nSuper in your opinion uh assuming we're being visited do you think most of them look like these so called de Leon graze the people described or do they look like us what do you think\nWell and it's a tricky question because I think the media I'm kind of might have this this kind of\nTrump or me or whatever you call it of of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think you know when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens ... gray large head ... shaped\nOil it gets reported but when when somebody says they see something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the caught or get the coverage but in my experience when people report entities just as when they report UFOs they come in all shapes and sizes\nRobust sure do but you but you saw almost saying then that people basically they hear this they hear this and then they think they see it\nYes I think perception plays a big part in this but here again who who can say what um what technology if we are being visited by a civilization in let's face it the universe is nearly fourteen billion years old\nImagine what a civilization which you say a million years head start on us money to be able to do in terms of you know hiding themselves masking that true appearance\nDeception uh it's it's unimaginable so so again I think we're in the ... ... ... we watch what we think we see and perceive may be very different from the reality of what's going on and it may ultimately be\nUnknowable to us true species of our town level of development what's your thought of the propulsion system that\nWell it's it's clearly a kid he ought to be some something exotic I guess we're in in sort of Star Trek territory and in one sense of some sort of ... light travel ... again there are some theoretical physicists working on\nSort of thing trying to figure out whether it would be walking\nSpace time whether it would be using wormholes I suspect gravity is going to be the key to this um gravity I guess of all the fundamental ... is the one that we\nKnow at least to bow often and therefore it's the one where we're perhaps more likely to make quantum leap breakthroughs in terms of of science and technology\nThat's going to the phones again let's go to Alex in Rochester New Hampshire to get things started Hi Alex welcome to the show\nI think you have a question of her new hope um I Hope to preface it with a little bit of a personal experience um I saw a where I Would call a UFO I'm On there for two dollars and Thirteen and print town in New Hampshire about twenty ... twenty miles west of a Manchester\nAnd I consider myself a politically and religiously liberal not conservative at all\nAnd I'm clear sober but had a definite um [noise] really evil ... who are real I don't I Can't say for certain it was demonic but it really had a very negative side who for the whole experience [laughter]\nVery scary very creepy had a very predatory feel that you believe that it's possible that some of the intelligence extraterrestrial visitors 'em might possibly be eager evil or negative possibly demonic not all of them but maybe from\nI again I think it takes us into the territory of water are we dealing with even if we didn't leave some something real do we really know what it is\nAre we dealing with it even if we didn't leave some something real do we really know what it is could can we really a scribe human emotion to it the problem with all of this if we can only come at this from\nA ... point of view and we tend to to be kind of you know very black and white I think you know our thinking sometimes we see it in politics we see it in religion you know it's glass half empty glass half full good aliens by the aliens\nAnd and you know one has to wonder does this actually come from whatever it is that your interacting with what does it come from you or I mean I've cultural background belief system\nPerception may be influenced by by documentaries ... science fiction or whatever it it might be I I don't I don't like to take anything off the table I mean I I I tried to be open minded with all of of this and\nI think earlier in the show I said that there is unlikely to be one single neat solution to the usa mystery so I think you know when you asked me what might be out there I don't think if there are other civilizations and the cosmos which I firmly believe there are\nI don't think it's going to be a question you know there's just one of the civilization um that for you know are they good or bad I suspect\nIf we share this cause ...\nWe share it with with a whole bunch of different civilizations which which may have absolutely different points on the moral spectrum if I can call it that um I guess the person's way of saying that would be you know there's probably\nGood aliens outlet but knowing I'm actually stick extraterrestrials\nAnd and ... year olds yeah with with the various intentions\nWell there's no question about it and you know I'm so convinced that in this vast universal bars and maybe even the multi burst that the prime more more you'll soup that is the same\nWherever you go you're going to have the same elements the same complexity you may have water you may not do generally you probably will if you're close enough to you store your son you're gonna happenings heat up a little bit\nI think there are millions civilizations throughout the universe the big question is how did it start and you know let's take religion on it but you have to do that for for just a moment\nWhat what do you think was the cause the jumpstart for life\nI have no idea I mean I think it's if if you throw ... nobody knows you\nKnow if if you throw the dice trillions in trillions of times they eventually maybe it'll it'll come up right but but much smarter people than me\nWith relevant experience in biochemistry and and all of related field\nHave have no idea frankly

rights you know we talk about you know this country waving banners have human rights and you know wanting to you know I\nTake a stand against a various countries because there's human rights abuses by the countries in which there are no human rights at all like you know watching federation\nLike China ah and certainly you know the Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia where beheadings and had shopping and chopping off hands and fingers and you name it goes\nOn on a daily basis so the ... situation George\nUnfortunately superseded by the economic ties to the U.S has a inter dependency on Saudi cash not only for U.S Treasury certainly for large purchases in the defense industry\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if\nThe school provides a you know at the end of the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans\nUp but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections but I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted author student loan novel huh\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you're making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um\n[noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there but I can tell you what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nUh people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war has the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so\nThe founders you know are they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan absolutely we're going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\n[noise] sure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default\nOn the loan they want to default don't that's right if it becomes more financial\nThere were to default on the loan they want the default don't that's right\nIf it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead well that's a defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantor ours\nAre often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm\nCompelled the borrower to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission right off the wall so you know where they can make a three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for servicing a healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation and so the financial incentives that\n... there's a federal student loan system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nKnowing spleen the process of a default to loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case I'm good easy numbers to start with so fifty thousand offshoot alone when the student graduates what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nUh they're unable to make payments they\nLose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise] um the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around\nOh let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalized interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty\nTwenty five show him the power is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly ... let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars\nOh my God so what the what\nThe lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise]\nWe can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera\nSo huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or so ultimately they will wind up um hopefully in the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make\nPayments for about a four ten months typically none of those\nPayments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars\nWhile these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or these agents that that compel them to do this loan rehabilitation\nGet a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus ... it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nFees and the ... indeed agents are collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guaranteed horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before\nA President Obama so these companies make out like bandits\nThey would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than uh than alone that remains it's good that I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nTo rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate\nThey default again three to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loans if that's the fault again and that happened something like eighty percent of the time\nThen the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take calls next hour with Alan Cohen coast to coast the\nSign of no go zone or read email newsletter today at ... dot com [noise]\n\nThomas Jefferson one said there are two ways to conquer and slave the nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is they will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the sons and they become subject\nTo arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWell that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly a in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise] uh\nThe one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests and court costs in fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson flirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war\nAs far as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand or they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these defaults the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan default is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org show many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nUh you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um [noise] I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this was happening to realize that\nYou know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoke suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment and for the case of default is student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\nIt absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAh unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse under Obama Obama essentially federalized the lending programs so that we're before\nA bank such as well as I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae now let us after a where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program now Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before\nHe said why is the government property not student loans this is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it\nA and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five you know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the ... system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good but since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than\nDone this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nWho herself had stock in student loan collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds [noise]\nAh so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could a file bankruptcy in wipe out to students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise] some of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away and so um\nSo yeah Congress ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about\nThree tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy this is less far less than the average for other loans so there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that\nWe've had just suffered under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing ... this is a problem to Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan Collins is west side of the student loan justice dot org linked up the coast to coast am dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\n[noise] oh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called H. are twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um delete the one line of federal code\nThat make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings so this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed a we would immediately see a dramatic\nDecrease in the price of college ah we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality\nOf the job that the government does administering the program [noise] ah so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nTelling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma\nOr is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan issues\nWell absolutely and I agree nobody wants to file for bankruptcy is a terrible thing to have to do and and even more difficult thing to fight for I should say [noise] ah but it's just the threat of bankruptcy that would really help the lending system but you know there there are a lot of things that we can and should be doing you know as I mentioned earlier President Johnson\nPromise that the loans or she would be free\n... more information on that you can a dog is it a dump us kids dot org

an English river my yeah how can they change names\nI don't know oh well you don't know I'm not going to know 'cause you're the guy in the no\nWell you know um maybe they didn't like the English river anymore they'd rather go on the red lake maybe the late ... better than that play hockey though I don't know they they play hockey I've lakes rivers up\nAnd we even earlier okay where are you looking at me\nLike I don't know because ... you have a better idea than I Do so I'll go with what you would do decided [laughter]\nYou know good hey you know what mark was outside because it's so nice and I was going through a website I was a lot of photos of a lot of our nation if we enjoyed the ethical so\nWe are right now currently uh getting photos done putting them up on our website and they're both going to be an arbitrator but some of these vehicles we have these previously enjoyed trucks are nice we've got a great flux right now uh when I was in Seventeen ram Fifteen hundred limited layering limited that's one of the vehicle and that's all they got about thirty three thousand miles on it so\nThat's a nice truck to come and take a look at take a test drive in which you know the sixteen ram Laramie that's ... that's the only got about twenty three thousand miles on it\nAlso another one or the ecological brand new brand new tires on it as well I'm\nJust going down the list I've got four different\nPreviously enjoyed rams arranging anywhere from twenty thousand nine hundred dollars all the way\nUp to about thirty seven thousand dollars just depending on what you want what your price ranges but all those that I just mention how leather interior ... seats this year will\nCall the navigation so we've got a lot of trucks out here that are loaded I'd have a lot of great teachers and you know just like I said depending on your um your budget your price range\nAs close to to be gone but they're still there is a little bit out there\nA yet and I liked it there to providing clean water it is a lot of our um um countries that are continue to fight to have clean water [laughter] um would that be like in the form of trying to to provide wells rice in the last time it\nIs it simply I'm building a well I'm are taking a well but uh\nYou know in in a lot of these communities the challenges that I'm\nA lot do gooders will come in there and you know with a with a pocket full of cash and say okay we're going to do this for you\nAnd then they do it and they walk away and then the communities like uh what do we do with this right they don't know how to maintain it it doesn't fit in with the way that they do things\nAnd it ends up the money just ends up going to waste and so the real key and that stuff is um if they have local partners on the ground and doing things that the community wants to get done you know and and helping empower the local people\nAnd it was something is is really different going in and dropping in and doing a service project and walking away\nRight and it's funny watching some of these uh uh yeah I'm One of them I think of as a seven hundred club I I've watched it a number of times where they go in and they'll ah they'll they'll dig a well around the group they get the money to take a well watch these these third world countries where they get a well and it's like this is this is the best thing ever regarding able to have fresh\nClean drinking water at their fingertips and it's something we take for granted ... when they got it there was just wonderful so I can see preventing clean drinking water is as really an important thing\nWell the advantage to being an international organization is say that that our club decided we wanted to do an international project and we could find a rope most likely we could find a Rotary Club in that area where we want to do the project and partner with them to get it accomplished um and that that's that's really the difference of\nBeing on international and and and in those cases I'm guessing a of a well say cost though I don't know five thousand dollars or whatever and then then you're a local group could raise a five thousand dollars send it over there they could get the well dug in you guys would all be a part of it right\nExactly well so I'm a lot of that um work is accomplished through the rotary foundation and so it's got this foundation and the way that it works and I contribute um\nUh regularly to the foundation is just part of our our dues structure and everybody in rotary can choose to do that but the money goes into the foundation\nAnd then it sits there for three years and then it comes back to the local district or is available to the local districts in terms of grants and so then we can write a applications for matching grant money I'm from the from the rotary foundation\nBut then the uh the because it sits there for three years then all that interest from all this foundation money is going to sponsor these projects so it it's a it's a really significant\nAnd all this foundation money is going to sponsor these projects so it it's a it's a really significant structure that provides um the cash to the things\nTo these projects um you know and I guess when it comes down to um [noise] there there's a lot of international stuff going on I contribute to the to the foundation that's kinda how I personally feel like I contribute\nUm international aid to the project from what comes down to projects for my club I like to try to focus and keep it as local as possible to because we've got plenty of people in need\nRight in our backyard way we you know what I'm ... and this is just a personal thing for me I I was actually a Peace Corps volunteer for two years really um yeah I was in West Africa I was teaching in the schools there um I Know what what worldwide need look like I'm\nIn the eyes of that you know but at the same point in time\nFor me to go up and and I was in camera in West Africa and I know there's a lot of need there'll be cold up and pick up and make an impact over there is great\nBut the thing is is that there's plenty of hungry people right in our backyard there's there's plenty of people um you know we need it you know a good place to live through um there's just so much need surrounding us um that that's really where um I think it the first priority right is your backyard I'm very much so and I and I've heard\nThat with a lot too and when you hear organizations groups whether it's rotary or other group said that uh like to help out internationally it it's good to see some of those things\nGo internationally but a lot of people do come back with the fact that what what about uh are are homeless we move got plenty of homeless female home lyrical right here and people that are going hungry here kids that are going hungry as you're right we do have our own problems that we keep\nWe keep a balance of got to do we've got to do both but we can't lose sight of what we what we've got right here absolutely\nA Scott ... is the president of the Rotary Club and he's our guest this morning on our outline program ... if you have any questions or comments you certainly can call in on the show six eight one twelve thirty or you the text us on the pizza tax line six eight one twelve thirty is that number you can email mark\nAT T R I've radio dot com and we would certainly be happy to take those questions as well All right I'm Scott you mentioned\nThe world polio day when the discovered how does how does the local organization get involved yeah\nWell that's that's [laughter] this is it uh for the time you know the thing is is that a lot of organizations will do fundraisers and the and the thing we haven't typically done much of of of anything to really support that other than making contributions\nAnd so one of the things that we're just trying to do this year was just tried to get the word out by getting on the radio so I even had our last pardon me more like well there's at least one thing we can\nDo is is actually talk about this a little bit\nMost people don't realize that this whole\nUm eradicate polio was actually created and and initiated by a rotary I'm originally\nAnd um and it still I'm One of the primary drivers now you've got um you know lots of organizations um the uh uh you know Bill Gates this fund is is contributing to that\nBut it was all pretty much initiated by rotary and I'm In rotor is raised over one point nine billion dollars to date to ah to eradicate polio in his down to I think three countries now two countries that are uh let's see\nOnly fourteen children have been paralyzed by the polio virus in Allah twenty Eighteen and that is huge\nSo big difference but ah so that's kind of how we do it but the but all\nSo many of our rotary members contribute to this foundation and and the foundation in turn is funding this polio eradication so just about everybody who who is wrote hear any contributed to the foundation and claim some piece of that huge huge endeavor and and very close to a huge success\nSo locally as far as when it comes to world the polio date you and your guys is group I'm a is all about getting the word\nOut yup there at this point is just a matter of trying to get a well get the word out so that people recognize what rover is all about 'em and the fact that it's that close\nAnd certainly there's lots of room to still raise a funds for doing that and so by ... you know supporting your local Rotary Club you and turn our kind of supporting this a rodeo or polio eradication effort okay I'm\nI'm what on the lake national or international seen them do does rotary do as well as it is it basically we're trying to raise the funds to continue to fight a\nWell so that means there's there's actually um I mean I and I've emailed us out to our uh our membership is well I mean there's opportunities\nOr any any one from here can pick up and go on one of these trips to India to actually\nUm apply the um the polio vaccine\nUm the so there were there was a ... and so these things come out regularly but it's it's volunteers who have to go out there and and get the vaccine to children and so like right now I think India's trying to do 'em all their children like\nIn one day or something like that so there's this huge initiative going on in India right now now India it's been polio free the only places where it's really left is along the Afghan\nPakistan border where um there's you know so much turmoil today and there's so much access to so hard and keeping track of who's going in and out is so difficult that it's really been a challenge\nBut that's just about the last place that um that polio exists in the world\nAnd if you can mix it there than in almost got a table too is that you got to stay clean for three years basically no new cases for three years then you can say okay it's gone\nUm but until that happens it's still out there and and you take your eye off the ball

says damage is done she was identified without her permission as he survivor of abuse in a campaign ad for democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp\nAnd on Thursday she said she doesn't that's today doesn't know what the senator couldn't do that would make it better like these or less and now we're all just stay in her name or and\nThis lady you twenty four year old self identified liberal from Bismarck North Dakota open up about being in the ad to CNN Erica Hill a new day\nI don't know what she hike camp could do that would make it better I Know that's why a lot of people in this situation are reaching out to seek legal counsel because of you know what she did this wrong she added that she thinks it's very reckless that Heidi didn't read and improve the document before it was published so many messed up\nEarly this week I Can't put into slam her Republican opponent representative Kevin Cramer for suggesting tough people do not identify with the national conversation about sexual

... have come forward and say they were either included without their permission or not survivors of domestic violence sexual assault or rape has specified in the letter\nHigh camp issued a personal apology to the women on Tuesday [noise]\nYou know the names that didn't want to be out there are already out there for the world to see you can't really retract that the damage is done that's ... said good apology oh no no this is ... oh okay ah high cans office told CNN Thursday that they plan to reach out to ... or\nSomething ... said she would already uh she was already told before that they said they were going to reach out to her\nHow long does it take to reach out to pick up a phone on the phone call there are other previous he told CNN that she no longer plans to vote for high camp on Thursday she stuck to that position telling hill that as of right now she's definitely lost my vote\nAnd as of right now to the most recent polls Fox News\nHas Kramer up by twelve and NBC valley news has Kramer by ten wow so this could not have happened at a worse time per Heidi Heitkamp\nNow the the one side note I'll make it on that she's doing this this woman is doing all these\nYou know these national TV shows she didn't want to be in there she didn't want to be identified 'em to why she doing all these you know the press now what did you just stay away from it then and\nYou think she would hide say say her piece you didn't want to be bothered and then you know I've tried to hide from the spotlight\nYeah I and I think she's right I mean it was obviously wrong you know what had happened in the name should not have been identified you shouldn't do that I kept I\nVery hard we we talked with is just the other day how or after the vote with the Supreme Court justice so that she they really pushed hard and maybe they they\nOh with the Supreme Court justice so that she they really pushed hard and maybe they they just overlook did they just ran a real hard and kept pushing throwing that after ... together purchased one together and and maybe didn't take their time to ... everybody knows what's gonna happen\nThough is the high camp going to pay for something that a staffer yeah higher by a staffer yes to buck stops ... it does right opposite the Tom yeah you know and and she's taking responsibility for it but that's the way things work you know you have all these people\nWorking toward getting you elected young does happen that are not personally you know are you sure be held personally accountable for by the campaign I disagree with you there because she wasn't attorney general\nShe is now a sitting senator now she wants people to vote for her to be senator again\nYou again so I on the radar here if if they had reached the ... southern Mexican border or not you know a number of the people in the caravan thought they were going to stay in Mexico they weren't necessarily you had a ... for the American border but what they could do is travel in relative safety\nAnd cheaply by joining this caravan of people okay otherwise it's very expensive if you're like tried to go by yourself\nAnd travel so they have their reasoning for being in a large group well strength in numbers that but ... but I have two and a handful of them are have no more ... for their plans to get to Mexico City the rest of 'em are headed to the U.S border so yeah I'm looking at a couple\nOf stories here um the Mexican government has said that five hundred federal police are being dispatched to stop the marchers from entering Mexico and the people who enter the country illegally will be deported me well and the tweet today do as president threatened to\nCut us humanitarian aid to Honduras if the if the caravan was allowed to drive into the border wow yeah and just by the just the you know those ...\nThey can go there to talk to them any bats run and run back to point to sell in there and I heard your dog or CD in that [laughter] ...\nOn our pizza tax lined the Democrats want to open borders but you find one of them that would take refugees into their house and let me know or for their own local town\nLike again then it's a big argument but the I I thought we had a legal way for you to enter the guy had a contract to you know and that's where the change has to be made\nIf if they're going to be a legal way to enter or not you know and and not just show up at our doorstep and want to get in\nYeah well as far as I'm concerned I and I once when I was younger we lived in Phoenix we lived in ... actually lived in Scottsdale my dad worked in Phoenix um it's not too far from that border and you know and in in when you get down to Texas there is a areas where you get close to the border and of course New Mexico\nI Would feel bad for the Americans that are citizens there that here that there's four thousand people on their way to the border and it does sound a little bit scary because you know who these people are\nAnd as a federal government if a hurricane went through and say the panhandle of Florida we're there we're here to we're going to protect them if some a terrible flooding happened in the mid west where there were going to help them if there is a forest fires and can in um California were there\nBut certainly got four thousand people marching marching and getting closer and closer to the border where hundreds of thousands of Americans live\nWell of course we should be there right away send a oh this is our border these are our citizens we do because what is it because there's more thousand that they're just gonna rough and push right through it all seemed like the idea probably more on the radar of the media because of the size of the group\nThat's my guess I mean seriously if you I mean we're town of just over nine thousand now it's almost half the town the town can burn she on the border now right so if you were if somebody lived down there and you were you know you've got a home in a business and everything\nI wouldn't be nervous and suddenly you know that there's thousands of people worried about the jumped the border on diesel homeless people\nComing up from there it was that some of them are\nOver but summer are chased out because of the civil unrest and government unrest and Central America you're older legitimately trying to leave their country\nAnd then others are just I think tank you know on trying to get to America jerk you know they're making a mad rush you know they're going to bull Russia but is it we were at a point now where you can claim almost anything uh you know we have rules and brings up you\nFeel threatened in your home country Yup I you know you can get into the United states will now everybody's threatened yeah the amnesty has gone way out of proportion out ... you know\nSo I Hope we we've been soul lacks now and ... the word gets back you know that ... to ... you\nKnow we should be telling everybody lives good in Canada so they'll just walk and walk right here you know and I got up somewhere in snow fence and just keep 'em one really use the old Jefferson highway they could bring them up and went up and like a country the LDS set it up\nSo that we can have like little food\nStands as well if I asked her grandmother water as you come by what candidates do they only have\nHorses are getting some ... old ... [laughter]\nThey only have horses and ... all my [laughter] welcome to Canada [laughter] we don't have enough America is for all his mental\nTrump is a hundred and forty four year old bull so packed that boost Chinese retailers and I had no idea this thing even exist it and what is it ... you look you might have Trump you might like Trump you might uh you know a guy to you don't like the way he talks you don't like the ...\nBut to me this is one of those interesting movies where\nWhy didn't we do this long time ago\nThis he's going to withdraw from a hundred and forty four year old international pulse ordering it that enables businesses in China to mail small packages to the United states and he hit the discount an arrangement government officials said boost foreign competitors in costs the U.S postal service roughly a hundred and Seventy million dollars a year\nBecause those to exit from the universal postal union the UP you\nA comes as the White House cranks up the pressure on Beijing to drop what it calls predatory commercial practices including swiping trade secrets are American companies operating in China\nThis has been a longstanding long festering problems said Robert to the chairman of the postal Regulatory Commission and independent federal agency the administration framed the departure as separate from the trade war in which Trump\n... has a impart terrorists on roughly half of Chinese goods entering the United states wow I say go go for especially a how much of a hundred and sixty million a hundred and sixty million or a hundred and Seventy million dollars a year out costing U.S Postal service yeah which is not in good shape the way it is not at all\nU.S Postal service can use any helping yeah stamps are going up again at the end of the you know there are now we are and\nWho else has stamped anyway I use ... her I buy a book because there's a machine and our office said if you run it through there and they put something on there and then you can send somebody\nAnd they were going to say that I Know how to know it doesn't\nAsk for any money to shows\nUp without permission of [laughter] rather than a personal stuff at home I get free at anything like what are you sending in where you know\nWe have we have um and we battle this for a long time here in rural Minnesota North western Minnesota we can post offices they're cutting back on days of operation days of delivery in the rural routes of all because\nThe post offices bleeding money Joe you know and and if you're taking a hundred and Seventy million dollars out of the coffers of just you know ...\nThere was a hundred and Seventy million is is the U.S postal service paying that no that's the ... the ... because the fact that they're getting this this huge discount on smaller packages\nThat money that says that this will force them to pay higher polio which would increase what they're getting because again the post office still has to pay that guy to deliver it or the woman to you know put it together whatever the all the different charges coming in the ... the airplanes and all that they have to pay it regardless of bad mail packages on there or not but\nUh so apparently a hundred and forty four years ago\nNobody knew that this was a good idea a president that\nProbably was a you're a you're going back to the late Eighteen hundreds or the railroads a large influx of Chinese laborers would come to the country it probably wasn't the ideal at that point to try to move the water's between\nThe United states and China at a time when our country was just about ready to explode yeah no it's all probably served as well at that point\nYeah but at some point yeah it should have been reading ... nobody ever really looked at it again you\nKnow those things are hidden away and so I ask you\nIs this not what a business man type of president does absolutely looking for every ... every possible and I'm sure that's what he was telling his people around the table going All right let's look at the numbers both let's find out where we can justify making cuts in and pulling out a different agreement and forced Beijing back to the table to\nTo come back with a deal that award for everybody like candidate like Mexico with dad but instead we spent all of our time on whether a judge Thirty years ago\nSomething wrong and we spend weeks on that when this is the real business of the government is what they should be doing I tell them to be creative and cutting costs instead of being creative and spending money yeah he's a businessman them yeah it because he also knows that if he's going to have any chance of being re elected\nHe has to show real progress just like any type of business person any chance of being successful you have to show progress otherwise are he has the jobs and the employees and they can't battle him on that you know as much as they want they ... they say he's a racist or because he doesn't want to illegal immigrants into the country\nAlthough he's trying to keep them out of the country so that you know more Americans are are getting these jobs and they're not paying underneath the table and you know people are forced to have to hire people and that's what he's trying to get but also some of the other things you know the uh\nThe fair trade with other countries yes there are certain businesses in America like for you know who have plants in other countries who are making automobiles and then trying to import 'em back\nThey're not doing us any good when they're saving all that money unemployed they're saving all that money that should be spent here in America so and they have these uh oh well was us well was us because you know we can't sell as many of these imports anymore and then start making them there bring them back to Americans are making them here in the NFL teams\n... at night and I just got a number one goal of victory by just outside of San Francisco of art and I thought of and thanks\nUh uh uh Eddie Murphy yeah wasn't that it um no I don't doubt that wasn't it was the one who was with a a a prior Richard\nPry ass or somebody ... million ... million will yeah he had like Seventy two hours ago and this money is like here I have had anything to be only buying shoes and everything is all my all my\nDrive me across the street here's a million dollars that would be tough I mean the fact that'd be cool reality show you know ... million dollars you get twenty four hours to spend it okay\nAnd you can't find any large too I think that was there was there was some stipulations you can't just give it all the charity or something you could give so much a percentage or something like that one night after the largest jak on mega millions history role to friday Powerball three hundred and Seventy eight million survived the next dry and you know that there's people out there that are like\nThank God because if I knew when I don't want anybody else doing it on other shot at it that's what I always think when I wake up and look at my ticket\nNo together since the and the numbers have changed together these two could be one point four billion dollars and welcome Friday Saturday so over the weekend if you're really lucky and you spend four dollars\nYou could win a vote in your show up for work on Monday yeah because it's going to take a couple of weeks of planning and we have then I'll well yeah that and that's why I'm buying tickets in North Dakota\nSo after the show I got to drive the Grand Forks again and buy some more tickets\nOtherwise you know if they're really worth it we as we always talked about this if you want and you came back and did some stupid and you had liability all of a sudden for having done it and then you have all this money yeah what would happen then well if you're smart you'd ... you'd have a bunch of different shell companies\nAnd a lot of different ... and limited liability here and there and they're and they're and they're in and then you put money in different places so that they can only two for one deal but I mean don't why would you come back to work that I mean you know what I'm saying I mean what if something happened at work that you're liable for\nYeah 'cause in radio there's a lot of it all wrong this maybe\nThis is the conversation sharply gender came from somewhere else but I yeah I just I don't know I understand what you're saying too because again let's just say Bobby won a billion dollars yeah all of a sad or as a hobby won a billion dollars why we're and Bobby winds at because Bobby's lucky when he's behind\nFantasy folds Motorola ads true let's just say I'm Bobby ... to have at our Web so he goes out\nThere and he throws his two dollars into the lottery and he comes back with a billion well he's got a good week or so to get the uh you know the CPA and the attorneys and everybody put together to come up with the plan how they're going to distribute the money so that\nIt's you know he he has a way to you know take the check and not just go to bang go like to catch this how does the million yeah now he comes back to work and in suddenly somebody finds out that\nHe's on the onus every day that's not like\nWhite on making coffee for everyone is yes\nYes and he's wearing clean clothes [laughter]\nYou might there might be something going on and he spent an extra divers here he's normally has a ... a ... so two days into it somebody finds out he's got the Powerball and we just happen to have a new Internet working here\nAnd she wants to come up with the reason why she wants to get paid now that could happen now I'm ... now you're going to say I could easily happen because we can see what happened to a a a judge\nWho's going to be put on the Supreme Court it was Thirty years ago they had no actual evidence but he went through about three or four weeks of of just war trying to save the job of becoming a Supreme Court justice\nBobby he might just happen to be doing this morning show and and working and and then in turn says oh no you know I was in the production room and he did this boa ... he's you know having to figure out a way to pay this\nI Know what I'd gladly under his car tires I'd be like okay go ahead I'm Sorry I'm ready to go every time he's both walk or all the antibiotic cargo and I don't know if you're good enough [laughter]\nThat's again that's going to be there's two different things that go wrong when people win this size of money\nOne um they either lose it you know because they there there are so many stories of people that are won like two or three hundred million dollars and they just went on some spending spree they gave a bunch of money to friends and family than they bought things and there were insignificant and before you know it\nTo access came around the next year and they had planned on that and then they owe ... thirty million dollars or forty million dollars a and then that's the bad way to go but then there's other people out there\nWho want to become celebrities with it they immediately want to be you know hey we're going to I'm going to get my picture taken with the big giant checking everybody's going to me I'm going to be on all the Tonight Show type of the shows and it'd be on with the uh you know\nWhy would you want to be my profile new new new a new low profile low profile as possible as go buy a bunch of radio stations yes one office and watch 'em all absolutely not no I mean actually take my private jet and fly for marketing marketing the the radio station you know\nThat's the idea if they don't have a if it's a really small station you build an airport their right of course yeah we'd have to have a ... yeah just because you come in and get you know you've got three or four hundred million dollars you could\nProbably build a few airports you know just to have a personal helicopter on your big ... and then just fly from the jet down to the station and fly back up from the jet afterwards you don't know much about it or not much [laughter]\nPeople further millions of dollars in five years when you\nDeveloped the ideas are any he sure doesn't work\nThat way um\nBut good luck with that [laughter] but what would you do if it's suddenly marketing you know somebody gave you a ticket because I Know you won't buy one what would you do with it\nI I don't know I don't I wouldn't want all that publicity I don't want to do all that money you know you just donated again or do you do that under out at a statue after just actually I just get asked

then also you add in sixty eight yard pass actually as well and that would actually put them up to eleven for twelve\nIn that first how deep gold correct wells so he would have\nA grand total of one hundred twenty six yards passing in that first taps accounting is other pass as well that went for sixty eight yards to the house for his receiver colonial grants for granted a nice verse tap on the

St Julian goes back to receive it but it bounces in the end zone for the touch back so be pioneers will start to their opening possession of the second half [noise]\n\n'cause they'll start to be twenty yard last [noise] or twenty five excuse me that's the college and professional rules so used to doing high school football here but she just uh forget that some of the rules are different in terms of ball spotting in terms of\nA touch back some scenarios such as and so the pioneers will take over from their own twenty five\nFollowing any touch back and now coming in at running back once again is to real Yuri\nBecause the pioneers have rotated running backs old game law\n\nFirst down intent quarterback wells any pistol set with Uri behind\nAnd a bad snapped don't well if he's got to go back for it and he's taken down at the five yard line [noise] boy the momentum has really swarmed in favor of vi task uh\nAnd uh now they'll spot of actually at the age yard line [noise] [noise]\nSo that is a loss of Seventeen yards for wells\nOn an unofficial run as they would call it just on a form of recovery\nSo that's unfortunate second down and seven twenty seven for the pioneers wells look in the past in the end zone rolls up to the right past is thrown away out of bounds intended for Yuri that brings up third down and twenty seven for North where\n[noise] why the pioneers in deep trouble here early in the third quarter\n\nAnd obviously if you're a coach Cox the safe route here would be just to run up the middle or some sort of run just to get some extra breathing room for this most likely in suing point or you'd take the risk and try a deep on here\nFor two different scenarios see what the pioneers come up with here with third down and twenty seven looming from their own yard line needy be thirty five\n[noise] and well steps back to past looks down feel pressured throws in the past incomplete near the left side line intended for Yuri\n... bring up for it down and the twenty seven for the pioneers legal three out\n\nHere to start this second half [noise]\nAnd so now they'll bring on rock we send me a to point to he has had a phenomenal bay punting the football now he goes against the wind with this one so we'll see how he does\nThat deep is done for the Vikings standing at the pioneer forty and a flight comes in serious gets away an

have much room to either get rid of or get away a punt on that one is well\nPioneers indicating both of 'em are against the Vikings\nSo again we will check\nAs soon as we get an official call here pioneers might have the football here\n\nTop side or no they they call opposite side of the pioneers\n\n[noise]\nMan for ... for\nLooks like it will just be a retrial veer off setting penalties Sylvie

pioneers\nApparently because it'll be for down and long stupid the pioneers is still up hunting situation and our movement again the task of Vikings get the pioneers to job they'll just take those five yards back they say\nIs the Viking defense of wind you were a little bit of switching there and the pioneers flinched and went for it so that'll be false start on the pioneers\n\nFinale seven

you\n[laughter] I think the um the wheels are going to fall off the season he's gonna there's going to be for the trades at the beginning and some of the young guys on the Lakers are going to get traded away really I think yeah and I think it's a bad for him to come to the west at this time is bad timing it's going to affect his legacy and aid may not make the playoffs\nWow well if he didn't make the playoffs it would and then it would be bad\nYou know what it would be a big hit as Dr Zarway said a lot of the teammates would get most of the blame but it would be a hit because and and here's the thing about the way they would say that he doesn't have enough you would argue with a million dollar question I Would say that that will be the narrative assuming he play well right yeah I don't expect to fall off like that\nWhere he's terrorize the west is obviously better than the east\nBut after Golden State and here's the let's look at it Portland you got two guards small guards who are really good but that them enroll players\nYou know Denver you got Paul Mills sap in the coal yo kitchen you know some good players not a world beating team\nA Utah you got Rudy go bare you got down to the Mitchell but he's young in their you know I mean I'm not going to say a LeBron James team with a good Brandon Ingram a good cop coups ... a good Josh heart Randall landscape can't
