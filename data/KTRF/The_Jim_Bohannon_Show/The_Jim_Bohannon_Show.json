caller I Am really disillusioned I followed the politics very close and I watched the Senate hearings\nAnd I like to get my information directly from the source ripe for the miles I Believe have but what I hear and all of what I see my own eyes\nAnd I'm really disillusioned or the way that Democrats are going about their whole political scheme to win back seats it's it's\nIt's unbelievable they hate that day and and and and you've heard it from senators and congressmen on the Democratic side of but yes I'm a Republican but I I Believe it I end up not a handout\nI I'm not a racist I'm not ...

Jim how fine thank you that\nI was telling the lady is is your call screener I said I'm a Democrat but I did not agree with the way judge Kavanaugh's case was handled\nIn fact I thought turned into the equivalent of clowns show and I don't think he got a fair ride and I think a lot of these Democratic senators run for re election they're going to pay a heavy price of the polls are these I certainly hope they do\nThey may uh let me let me offer the rationale here and and this is not an excuse I don't consider it an excuse at all but I Do think that this was the reason you were talking about a number of Democrats who would not in the general course if things go down this path\nIn the Democratic establishment is feeling the thundering hooves the bows on the far left\nThey remember what happened to Joe Crowley the New York congressman beaten by uh uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nAnd and there have been other similar cases Dianne Feinstein of because of California's primary laws running against it even more liberal Democrats than she is in California they are running scared now is that an excuse to do what they did know but it is an explanation\nWell as I said Jim I think he was inexcusable I think that one problem I had with it if these women had a problem with judge Kavanaugh\nWhy didn't they bring up these uncorroborated stories back X number of years ago when he was up for consideration is in the United states court of appeals judge they just say ... and I can't forget how that Ford woman\nSent Dianne Feinstein that letter and the effects that oh by the way

the night the those charges that that Dr Ford is pretty much that she doesn't want to ah pursue that any farther and she has no ill will toward\nA judge Kavanaugh um is is like at all just evaporates

chances are taking control of Congress and the upcoming met terms\nI Will see I Would like to think you're correct I don't think so and I I Would put it this way I Would not what anybody out there to base their decision on voting\nBased on the fact that it's in the bag I don't think it's anywhere near in the bag probably in the Senate Republicans will gain seats because it is simply a too many Democrats are are heavy seats to defend I I figure three or four seats myself in the house\nIt is entirely possible that we will see the return of Speaker Pelosi and then the the notion that everybody has motivated the way that you and I are I just don't think it's necessarily true Andrew and that scares the daylights out of me\nWell again I Would say to anyone listening please don't set our home go out and vote because if you don't ... you get the government you deserve\nNo unfortunately that's true [laughter]\nThat's the I I absolutely agree with you yes be sure you vote don't be so

called themselves antifa that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course that those tactics\nOf a silencing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these people but that is that is is the sad a problem\nAnd that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective but you are so pure and you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else then the only answer in my book\nAnd you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as written my book is to arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society be reduced to ... to the level of ... who can put together more of violence in the street\nYou know I I think you're going to several important\nPilots in the street you know I I think you're several important porch or whatever\nThe porch so I Try to make in the book has to do again with the ... psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's ... for some time now that there's an increasing degree\nOf of the offices within the society and the judge to increasing degree of moral perfectionism obsession will\nThinking is in society as a result when when when one encounters those types of psychological structuring individuals are those individuals are very prone to what we call projection\nAnd that is that they tend to\nUh take aspects of the the denied a self\nMake up and to place them on people around them\nAre so when you have a group like anti FAA\nAre claiming that the anti fascist and you look at their behavior it's very very obvious that the behaviors that if you're one would expect from the fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left projecting on the ride for everything that they're doing\nA and denying claiming that it's the rights\nDoing it so that I think the motivation for some of this behavior in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely I think one of the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of enforcement of the laws that are ... that are currently on the books\nFor a place like a Portland for for the mayor of Portland to sit by and have people rioting\nOn the streets and refusing to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and boundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah ah again it it it is not something that uh that that can could possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples of some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought the rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass are behaving like civilized beings and that is\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that is is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nWho's teaching yeah go ahead\nWell again absolutely but it it's the role of the Gulf than a political local level in the federal law enforce the laws of the country and if they fail to do that than you can expect a increasing outburst from these groups because they're essentially unable to behave badly\nExactly are we are you telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and ah people respond\nPositively win or are they are told that their tactic is uh is going to be tolerated stay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology\nInvolved in the the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and

the\nForces in places that tend to moderate the extremes of views or at least a as a manifested in the mainstream move of of society\nAnd and in addition the idea of propagating one view only to the

proceedings in the rest\nTo act as a deterrent and you can but we don't do it enough and that's one of the reasons why it currently is not we haven't done it in Pennsylvania all the way back to a guy who was a mass murderer years and years and years ago and wanted\nWanted to end his life he's the only one that's got in the last Thirty years or so I Want to say no I don't want to go through all the average schemes of islands and torturing and doing all that stuff\nA lot of people it also helps to get life imprisonment easier when you have that as a chip if you're not going to confess and is we're going to go through the big trial and all that\nYou get by for imprisonment versus the death penalty it helps to facilitate all that that's a practical argument for it I'm just saying that we have a man running for governor that the media other than what they did it Katie K which was brilliant\nDoesn't want to probe this all this powers coverage all these people arithmetic a massacre oh my God and then ... says there's severe as penalties as heinous crime and all and they asked him well are you in favor the death penalty for it\nI'm not going to end it just it's amazing to me that you can get away with that just answer if you say no\nI think life in prison I Am spiritually philosophically whatever I'm against the death penalty just how us this is what goes on in politics too much by the way this\nThis governor's race in Pennsylvania is running against the guy named Scott Wagner they had one debate for forty minutes and guess who the debate moderator was Alex trip back you may not have heard I'm not making it up\nThe jeopardy guy and he went off on just crazy talk it was embarrassing that was the one debate moderated by Alex trip back you can't make this stuff up", "year":

lifetime job on the U.S Supreme Court correspondent minor Raj who say key Republican senators decided that sexual misconduct\nHigh let's go back to when I'm not sure what happened mainly a fever falls planted the bomb ... most of the pond\nAnd people were falls recovered on the very next play grand Hartman through when I pass to the receiver who turned to run with it before we ... we can do that all the time when the pro players do that but the Bob ... shouldering stayed up in the year high enough but the defender was able to come in and he's in it right on the sideline and pick it off\nSo that was that was unfortunate Fergus Falls convert that into a touchdown Dr before it said and done and lead them six nothing if they failed on the conversion we're just about done with the first quarter already I mean it went that quickly I I the ... make a drive\nLate in the quarter drive the football down the field take them all all the way down to the three yard line and fumble\nTrying to get ... you didn't millions only turn it over on the phone bill you will like the effort but the big turnover and Fergus Falls at that point of stabbed which they're running game when Ninety seven yards\nOn Fifteen place and scored to make it twelve nothing so if you don't fumble there and get in the end zone get six six\nAnd Fergus Falls doesn't get that long drive and the momentum and build and build a ton of momentum because it gave her a lot of confidence that they can run the football prior to that they had been passing was much more than ... than running the football\nAnd their first touchdown was set up by a a a an over the top throw that dropped all over the defenders hadn't right into the hands of the receiver and they did that a couple of three times on the night that same domination of the quarterback Olson informing the receiver and that set up their first touchdown soda ...\nGive up the long touchdown drive and instead of being six six or even ahead seven six\nThey're down twelve nothing\nAt that point the all the momentum in the game change right from that point on Fergus Falls pretty much ran the ball or will the rest of the night all of their drives weren't linked the either ... or ...\nAll the rest of the night all of their drives weren't lengthy either ... or your age or both or their shortest touchdown driving and I was like fifty two yards and even that wants to eight or nine place\nOr they had drives of Fifteen plays they had to drive a Thirteen plays and another drive a fourteen plays for touchdowns battled chew a ton of time off the clock in the meantime the problem is continued to struggle hanging on to the football\nDuring the ball over in this game four times three phone calls and the intersection and it was on the ground at least two other times that they recovered it yeah I Know what was that was a little white and the little a little slippery\nBut it was white and slippery for the appalling two and a a one turnover in the ball game and that was the most part right so are you both have to play with the same conditions unfortunately Fergus Falls took more advantage of the problem mistakes and the problem is doing it for his falls mistakes tonight\nAnd burgers ultimately was able to what established they're running game which they told us before the game they finally found last week\nThey'd been running a spread they showed spread the tiny into but they ran the football out of it and ran the football effectively\nI thought some nice things for the promised I Know the goal Johnson played very well on both sides on the football\nAnd particularly ran the football very hard I bought the ... say utilize their check down routes a lot more and didn't try to go over the top all the time which has been a problem they've had early in the year ... ah they're passing heritage wasn't a lot because Fergus Falls close very quickly in a lot of times on reception there were only getting three and five yards\nInstead of eight ten twelve Fifteen which is what you're hoping on those is that that you get some rec yards and run after the catch but all in all I thought some good execution there are in regards to it to some of that into the game the passing department was up around fifty percent\nOr just the one interception that on the deflected ball early so why not some not terrible things there by any means but uh but ultimately\nFor the river falls or they get beat on that over the top throw a couple of three times\nAnd I don't have the balls but not accepting the balls they were sidelined patterns so into the outside and just dropped by Olson right over the top of the defenders added right into the receivers and they rented four times they completed three of the ... and all of those either cab driver alive or set up touchdown drives\nFor for his falls but it was bad fumble it's a three and I'm a Ninety seven yard drive that ensued that really changed this game and the fortunes of tonight's contest or for the revolver unfortunately for the problems they dropped all when sex\nAnd it gets to if if if that's tough for tougher\nYeah I get they get the latest now on next friday night and then they turn around on the following Wednesday and go to Detroit lasers on beating and ranked in the state yeah and that wraps up their regular season before the post season begins when what will be on the road certainly [noise] South American legion post one Seventeen and the focus was in\n\nWell in any in any event at the point is that it's hard when you get beat thirty or nothing to say they played better but they played better right than it is a you know they did they did some things well they had some longer drives are they putting together a combination of a running game in passing game tonight I defensively they had several big stops on Fergus Falls\nBut I got to watch the heart down right they got being done the hard got five or six times tonight on defense and that's a lot of families are gym well the thing on the hard county is the guys that were in danger or interior Lyman may\nNot get it if a if a a line backers jumps to count trying to come in and a run Blitzer or past month and just gets there too early that happens right\nBut these weren't for the most part interior Lyman you all can see the football Mm\nWait for the football to move then you move your bed and unfortunately it cost him some key are they in turn some a second and third belongs in the second and third insurance and help resolve keeps them drives alive but but ultimately this game turned on a fumble at the Fergus Falls three and then in suing Ninety seven yard drive that made it into the score football game\nFor his laws as a season has gone along I Believe they opened up the oil into the open up the year and oh and three on three and now they run three in a row they're three and three and they're playing a very good for you is it both ways\nThey are but they play it was very difficult schedule early on uh I mean they opened up with a with a Wilmer and with a Detroit lakes\nAnd [noise] or um or be quiet I forget which in there and dropped all three of those first three games all three to go to football games right so why their schedule has have lightened the little bit here\nAnd are they began to play really good football now I think it was the quiet they lost and I believe they beat her own last week and then the week before that but in east Grand Forks in that game they were down twelve nothing at halftime and fought back to the for the first three and a half games in play real real well right\nThis is not a devastating Fergus Falls team like we've seen in the past I mean they've had some teams have been all my goodness look at them more in this article but did they did they remind them just to get some really weird they reminded me of the problems of about Fifteen Years ago\nGrind it out punch it down your throat chew up time off the clock and oh yeah score and make the lead bigger right and that's what they did tonight\nAnd and unfortunately for the problem is they come out of it with another loss and go down to thirty and nothing to be\nYou know those lines thirty points or its downs to do it especially animal but for hours of not been able to score points this year you pick a believer and a ... down ... yeah they well they got to be able to put a dry is together ... when he was in there longest ride this year\nWell the one right before after right before the midpoint of the second quarter when they uh you know aren't you football now in the film is online at three and was a very nice drive and then you ... ... hanging in there and you know first and foremost trying to get extra yard age which is a good thing right\nNow you're you're you're one guy is the fight for your age but when you find that I did you have to protect the football yep and they didn't tonight\nIs that better probably lawyers off and on off and on but you know when you're trying to make big things happen sometimes those kinds of things do happen to you in the it's not right if not what you want to see but it it's part of the game sometimes\nAnd uh right now more than anything else the problem is the best thing that could have happened in the process and I didn't if they got paid on that long drive and tied the game up\nNow I'm not saying they beat Fergus Falls out but I guarantee it's not thirty and nothing it you'll be able to score it on that Dr ... would be I think it becomes a very good football game at that point because all of a sudden everything neutral again well let me also got a lead in laws and you've got a little met them yeah and you got\nFor as long as it's going to have to get the football and they're gonna have to take a dry themselves but as as as as a ... ... what do they have to do I mean and it seems like they're getting the holes and they just can't recover from them\nAnd that's a that's a big part of it is they they've they've dug themselves some old this year and unfortunately some of those laws have been deep holes and and it's hard to climb out of it was it just is right and now they're they're scheduled doesn't help and you know and they they play a very difficult schedule yeah you know there's\nNot a soft team on their schedule out of jails having a good year and deal with but I mean thousands just fell the five hundred tonight but they build a viable losing done being Detroit legs\nWho they're probably still play right and ah they get a good first falls in east Grand Forks is now a drop the couple there for him to write but uh they had that one point there at one point were undefeated and and playing very very well\nA than the cast it in the first half the big thing was down the stretch in that first that with time winding down gets in Comedy Central got the ball back trailing eight nothing\nAnd and\nReally needed that it was funny because I I don't know how there was just like a couple of minutes left before happen is that really bad at first out they had moved the ball they haven't had a first down their office was terrible they couldn't do anything right and I said all first thing they do is just pick up a first out\nWell on that that that\nDrive up to look plays later there was like\nSecond out or they got it first out first burst out\nThen they would get another first out and they got to drive established and they got to go and they did this with the help of Daniel Gonzales it was the ... and found some yard is not a ton at first but enough to get some first downs enough to ... ball down field they would get down field they would have a fourth down for the goal\nAnd if the charges hold them they're going to have time leading a nothing big difference it but it's been ... central which scoreboard down they go in the end zone they score now it's eight six they try to do going to a point conversion it looks like they're not going to get it he just run into quarterback throws\nA to point diversion deep in the back of the end zone and you dive in and the officials that were there I didn't see any of the case we're watching all the official nobody's making any indication that coming out in the end we will go by the indication of kids who got his that's all the fans of the players all jumping up and down there going yeah her right\nSpecials aren't doing anything we did but he caught it we couldn't see on that\nPart of the answer is Lee is you know I told you remember that and\nSee anything didn't give him ... Smith garden even give them either [laughter] when it was\nA it was a touchdown and it was a to point diversion where ... natural though and it's a halftime so great first out a chargers had out played kissing county central but we're we're in a tie it's eight eight burn that apps that can have comes up the bears cats are the first uh scored back the second half\nWas changed kissing county's central now started to pick things up and went to the air a couple of times got a couple of passes the drop in that open things up for them a little bit\nThey would score they would take a fourteen to a delayed and now they're in control and the chargers can't get anything they can't pick up a first down or the defense give them credit for kids who got his central late they really Stein made\nA jade and key so they they shut him down he had over a hundred yards and the first asked he had only a few yards most of the second half a end up with like Seventy or thirty seven carries an a hundred and\nUh I don't know what it was a hundred and forty hundred and thirty seven hundred forty or something like that but they really support him up\nAnd that that could have had that allowed there up in the kind of take control and get going because now they start to run the ball they start to\nFix them things up to big place in the second half in a very tied ball game made a difference and it was both\nFrench Peters is\n... ... did it twice he got thirty some yard touchdown run that opened it up to it to score game late in the ballgame and at that point it was\nTwenty I think it was like sixteen and six twenty to twenty two to twenty two to eight\nTwenty two to eight hundred you know any time I think there's that\nThe kickoff comes on the barricades and lows is Jens than\nThose Seventy six yards and scores the touchdown a kickoff return for judge down and the two point diversions good now we've got a ball game again it's a six point ball game with a couple of two and a half minutes or so to play but now it's on the chargers deep as to get the ball back\nThey hold him on a first backing down they got a couple of yards\nUm and they call a timeout from both they use a certain time out so now they use up their time I'll just element and a half left and his third down and about four and about\nThe I don't remember isn't that isn't a thirty thirty five thirty six yard line something like that\nAnd only into was holding their they hold a mirror the charges get the ball back and a shot at the time is up or winning it down the stretch and bad trend Peters then again the big name trend breaks off the left tackle\nAnd he goes sixty some yards or the score\nAnd that pretty much did it end up when I get that I thirty to sixteen but what a ball game it was closed it was ... it was entertaining\nAnd here's a couple of the things later that that I mentioned before we started to uh go back for their turn over a we're big tonight but did not decide it gives the central three or was it three interceptions and coupon bowls\nWhile the chargers had two bumble so there was a lot of turnovers bear cats that more but still end up with a winner did I\nKnow is these two teams playing tonight as you mentioned with the weather and everything and there were a lot apparently he's combing the football game or a believer\nYeah there was a good break before over anything\nBut yeah there was a break before anything\n[laughter] it does there was like ten and eleven penalties I think on the charges for Seventy some yard um and yeah that that hurt\nAnother thing I heard Lee is is the fact that gonna hang on to the ball for the charges they couldn't hang out with a ball they only had two bubbles they gave up but they dropped the ball the number of times on the snaps it was either through the and the ... so he dropped the ball or whatever that ... was a problem\nFor the chargers and they had a couple of opportunity is one of the ponds went through the ... Peterson and at midfield charges recovered it and now you think okay now they got it now they'll start gone but instead they follow the gator right back it gets that got his central turnovers we're back today timely\nThese two teams now as we go into we numbers salmon\nOver Shirley I'm concerned counting central big win for them\nBecause they were offering a smart in law's a couple of weeks ago\nTo a student or no to him a smoother forty two to nothing and a half to feel good going down the road to being murdered drug Britain walk with only two of the games left in the regular season and we get ready for the play offs\nDoubt no doubt about it this is not only are a huge when it's confidence builder for this team now knowing that what they can do what they can accomplish they got a big win over good game and go to rich Greg law\nNow that gives them a shot they got two games left it they went out they win the next two games they have a legitimate shot here it'd be the number two seed section eight I'm at you know um and for the chargers\nYou know they really and I was at night they needed to when they when they got a great shot at being number two seed 'cause they they need to it but now these guys are gonna have to win I ended up the charges even at the charges went out and they're cats went out and be very cold as you get the number to spot because\nCharges now a drop one to the bear cats but they're close enough that if you are at than the bear cats could add the upper ...\nMirror cats willing to die or mustard like ... cents slowed down a ... when I went up there a couple of weeks ago a boy I tell you what are you in one heck of a gamble the nonsense and on the fence and even on the ... returns [noise]\nYeah yeah it is a is a heck of a player he had a good first apps solid burst out he really didn't get going in the second half I don't know what kind of adjustments Corey wailing made for the kids have got is that the one who made the right one\nLine cook county's central or individually who stood out\n[noise] well ah office will be trying to figure out a couple of big place a deep and simply there were a couple of like really was a little bit of everybody a gang tackles that's big tackles a battle\nAgainst dollars on off that a couple of ah not long runs but it deaf uh these short ones to get the ... going again so those are big problem but defensively their big Josh running a good leader he's a quarterback on this ball club\nWhen they needed about two or three yards up the middle as a quarterback keeper he just keeping himself go straight for he's a big quarterback and day out some good yard spoke to a good leader the leadership on the field\nReally are going with two weeks left in the regular season ah what's next for these two teams\n[noise] um if I remember I think ... and a ... at all I Believe in the last two for the chargers\nOkay and her kids and kind of central I think it's when a Mac and Clyburn conduct\nNuts Riyadh just moved up here you know there is going to tune games are concerned counting syndrome bows to finish emphases I'm happy with that\nOh yeah and if it if they can pick up two when's the next two games legitimately or they're three and three now they could end up five and three and again very much a I have a shot at than ever to state one of the unknowns I didn't get section eight I met Kelly and ours all nobody plays them so we don't know I think they only had like one loss or something to\nWrite a one or two losses so they're a team that nobody plays so they're going to be if they can do to win a date ... there'll be in that mix too just because of their win loss record\nBarry gasping for denied their last two weeks and they had licensing and lost to two teams that are still undefeated on the season they lost to Stephen are no and then they lost to norm and counties storm last week\nI see Norman counties we want again tonight ... to nothing so you know you lose those games but as long as you may be a respectable and looks like being on the street going into burglar tonight\n[noise] yeah yeah they were really focused and of course they play for a trophy a nice to see that I Can't I Can't remember the name of the trophy but it's got is that the ones that again a ... a\nThat were held today again have the Grand Forks China's Saturn first of all are camped the
