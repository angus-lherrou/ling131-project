live from me Geico Fox Sports radio studios were Fifteen minutes good debut Fifteen Percent or more I'm car insurance visit Geico dot com for a free\nRate quotes so a game three of the world series is going to go down in history as one of the great postseason games and most remembered or discuss postseason games\nOr in all of sports and I I don't know if I can if I can call it the greatest game I've ever seen there are some other great games that come to mind and that's to the prisoner of the moment sort of talk but just everything surrounding that game\nThe atmosphere the length of the game all of it jumbled into one of the way that the game ended absolute craziness a as we saw a seven hour and twenty minute baseball game in game three of the world series or the game started a little after five o'clock local time in LA\nI had just gotten home\nFrom doing a show here at Fox Sports radio when the game got underway right I just got no\nI didn't realize that same game was going to be on a as we were in the middle of our two of our we do overnight show it is it's just bizarre a thing after another that took place in the game or a but it was to the Eighteenth inning\nMax Muncie up to bat for the Dodgers bottom of the Eighteenth and already the longest game in a history of the major league baseball post season and this is outside of courtesy of Fox [noise]\n\n\nCrazy the absolute craziness and so the Dodgers uh survive a now the series is a two games to one\nWith a game for coming up later on today I Would imagine this is a big disadvantage for the Boston Red Sox by the world does a Dodger fan those crybaby Dodger fans who have been complaining about Joe Buck and John small uh the entire post season\nUh where are all you twelve year old [laughter] I'd like he's [laughter] but there are showing more excitement for the other team you know there's been a lifeguard team shut up but what are you at twelve years old pitching because you get a three musketeers here in your Halloween candy\nShop I\nYou sound like me when I was younger you go trick or treating if somebody gives you whoppers you remember those things because basically I shock with chocolate on the outside\n[laughter] I agree Dodger beds complaining because you don't bug and John ... being mean to my team a good change your diaper\nUnreal that I I did see that all postseason it blows right and we're not talking like just Dodger fan but members of the media\nTour or or or just claiming that John ... and Joe Buck or being mean to their team I don't know where do you think John smokes and Joe Buck would rather stay three days in a row Milwaukee or LA words in eighty degree weather\nCome on man a but nonetheless\nGreat win for the LA Dodgers a fantastic performance by max month the a ... in the clutch bottom of the Eighteenth I hear was max Monti who joined Fox moments after his walk off when a Dodger Stadium I\nSaved over seven hours\nWe just drove by the way\nEye on that but I I'm a really good I argue about\nAh you know he ... he went on my way or the you know caught and everything and bought it and it was all like but uh [noise] and I don't get it by about ... about that on ... fought back and [noise]\nA kind of want to take like that before he tried to go back to her daughter saw\nAnd so he gets it gets to the gay parade bath afterwards and uh it just ban what what is what a crazy set 'em ... set of circumstances ... months he wins it on the opposite field home run but ...\nI actually thought max months he won the game a earlier against of all the because he hooked one down the line that looked like it was out and it was foul by less than a foot had to be less than a foot that it was a foul ball I thought that you did it out so it does point he was seeing ... better than any other hitter in the Dodger line up\nUm and and and the real victim and all this\nAnd the guy who's going to get it you're just going to look at the box score and you're gonna chalk up all lost the Nathan a ball team and he's going to have a loss on his record in the world series ... did was absolutely amazing like the performance of Nathan ... in that situation\nBut you gotta you gotta consider this\nSo neither of all the ... and just these are all the the circumstances and all the factors that that led to why Nathan ... he was in the game\nShow the Boston Red Sox tied the game up\nA home run by Jackie Bradley in the eighth inning off can lead Jansen and so the red Sox all of a sudden find themselves in a position to to potentially win the game a game to\nPosition to to potentially win the game a game that they thought they were going to lose because they were trailing late and so the Boston Red Sox now changed their approach so a couple of more innings go by nobody's scores nobody's scores Nathan ... comes into the game\nAnd Nathan of all these brought him because he's going to finish the game out\nAnd best case scenario you get a lead and Nathan of all the is there for the ... and and potentially to save and he's going to close it out and the red Sox are going to take a thrill lead and then after the Boston Red Sox go up\nTo ... to one there's a bases loaded situation\nAnd the red Sox hit a little uh a number on the ground and and you just bad luck if you want to call it uh the Dodgers pick it up step on home plate and it's a force out any innings over they go to the bottom of the thirteenth\nAnd the red Sox would have all the dealing he ends up walking max Muncie or they get a couple of outs but on the second out\nNext month the advances to second base because a Red Sox player defending against the shift to add to add to run so far to catch a pop out that he fell into the stands\nAnd maximum see was able to advance to second base so ...\n\nTo find out fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for details tap tap water\n\n[noise]\nJonas knocks Fox Sports radio [noise] company alive here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios [noise]\nAh in about ten minutes from now here\nOn our focus our rule I have a another edition of the scraps with Kevin figures that's where we uh get to some things that we have not had a chance to get to on this show and there are plenty\nOf them are because if a but just a crazy crazy Eighteen innings seven hour game\nThat wrapped up a that started as I was getting a whole ... from doing the previous show on friday and ended while I was doing the overnight show on Saturday morning just the bizarro land at Dodger Stadium as the Dodgers on an Eighteenth ending walk off\nBeat the Boston Red Sox three to two\nAnd now a we've got game for coming up on Saturday um five o nine pm Pacific time eight or nine eastern time I is first pitch so we'll see how that plays out uh we got a a Dodger fan boys\n[noise] fan\nBoys who are listening to the show and they're upset because we're praising Nathan ... apparently everything's got to be a a a ball wash the Dodgers\nAnd you've got to talk nothing but Dodgers or you can only uh you can only talk about the LA Dodgers I'm a guy wide eyed guy right then and he goes ah\nGet off of all these beliefs he wanted to do his job and he lost the game [noise] what about the job Walker buell or did that was an awesome performance which was\nParked my car wash sure that's as\nBig as it gets right there was a ball washing fan boy a football\nThat's amazing that is somebody who cannot absolutely cannot see the other side of things they just can't\nEven it'd be nice to my favorite team that's probably somebody also has been complaining that Joe Buck and John small to been picking a new team here in the nice things about our team\nGod [laughter] so I Do I tell you they're they're the little kid on Halloween\nWho goes trick or treating and gets pissed off when he comes back and he opens up his bag and he got like lassie taffy instead of more Snickers bars\nWhat a child right\nUm see a game for is a is coming up later on a Saturday Night uh I'm actually I'm going to defend somebody in the world of sports that it's not gotten a lot of defense and I'm going to defend them\nBecause I think some of the criticism is pretty ridiculous um so I was talking about this earlier on the show so Jimmy ... below spoke for the first time since he injured his knee or out for the season\nAnd he just talked about you know the the idea that these injury prone to it they they you know people don't know if they're talking about it that's what they're saying and some of the the criticism that drop below got I think\nIn large part due to the fact that he's a former patriot and I say that because\nIt is in large part due to the fact that he's a former patriot\nAnd I say that because like if you have an impression or an image of somebody that you went to high school with and say there were in a hold of you in high school\nThey could go on to do great things in the years since high school and and be a completely different person but for a split second when you see him again for the first time at the reunion you still go back to where you knew them in high school and they were the bag\nAnd and you're never going to get that out of your mind I think Jimmy ... deals with some of that because when when he got criticized for going on a date with a porn star that was a big time story and to me that was a big time store because he was a patriot and because so many people hate the patriots or when the guy tears up his knee\nInstead of people saying man that's a tough break for Jimmy ... there were a lot of people out there who are criticizing him oh well he's an idiot I mean why didn't you just go out of bounds the game was out of reach a Kansas City you didn't need to make that play God Forbid the guy wanted to make a play for his team\nGod Forbid but I think he's dealing with a lot of the heat because he was a former patriot and somebody else in the bay area who is dealing with a lot of heat and it gets completely ridiculous is Derek car their cars been getting crushed\nAh people thinking that he was crying out an ad on the field after he took a hit\n'em there's the stories that are going around about Derek tar and his teammates losing respect for him because he cried while he got hit a in an NFL game that teammates don't respect them there are some people out there that are floating the idea that ... cars soft\nYou know maybe he's not tough enough\nUh you know maybe you can't trust her depend on their car from a from a mental aspect because maybe he's not tough enough um\nDo you know how ridiculous that is how ridiculous that sounds for people that are crushing Derocher like how how completely ridiculous an asinine it is to call anybody in the NFL\nSoft it's completely ridiculous\nTheir car had his leg snapped two years ago he said numerous injuries the past couple of years and he's always come back always\nI'll be honest with you I blew my knee out a few years back dislocated kneecap torn ligament destroyed my knee destroyed or playing basketball\nTo this day I'm cautious about climbing down off a ladder because I don't want to step wrong and have my knee cap sitting next to my ankle again like it was a few years back\nI'm paranoid about it to this day I'm overly cautious about it just imagine a pocket of three hundred forty pound lineman collapsing at your legs thirty times a week\nAfter you snap your leg two years ago imagine how tough mentally you have to be to overcome that fear\nThe idea that he's soft\nOr not tough enough he's completely and totally ridiculous I Do a show with Brady Quinn here on Fox Sports radio every single Sunday night I Can't tell you how many injuries Brady is dealt with\nPlaying games in college where he had a concussion that was so bad he didn't remember what happened on the drive\nHe has to sit a certain way and the chair because of his back injuries that he suffered while he was playing back injuries that were so bad that he had spinal leakage\nOr a a a leakage from his school India was fine what Steve Kerr ad Steve curves issues where he was he would feel nauseous and all that Brady dealt with those as well to he can't sit in certain spots in a chair because of the damage that he's done\nHis left foot is completely deformed because he got Liz Frank and he said other foot injuries that he hasn't been able to get fixed because if you do get it fixed you're on the shelf and on crutches for six to eight months and he's got two little girls at home that he's got to take care of\nThe pain and the agony that these guys go through we will never know\nWe'll never have any idea what it's actually like so when we flowed out the idea that there are cars soft\nYou're an idiot he it doesn't it doesn't make sense\nLike fans in media members calling out an NFL player soft\nUnderstand that there's not a player in the league that you could out of violence on the field\nNot a quarterback not a kicker not lineman not a hunter nobody\nAnd it's why I've said this and I've always maintain this and this is just a fact I've said it before football players and fighters top of the food chain\n... you cannot dispute that toppled the food chain\nEvery single plays a coalition of collusion every single play is violent every single play you're risking doing permanent damage to your body every single time out\nMost of us we go to work and if we got like a really tough sales job you you know what a real rough day for us is like you know when you make eighty calls and you get rejected eighty times in a row man that's a rough day sales wise proof\nThat you go back home and you got to hope that you'll hit quota later on down the road man you know a rough day but you know we'll figure it out or a or your show up late because you had to deal with traffic or you blow a flat tire on the on the side of the freeway that's a real rough day\nAh that that's called a combative day or that's called an uneasy day at work for a lot of\nUs for an NFL player every single time you show up to quote unquote the office\nJust got their good she stepped Steph Curry on Thursday ridiculously good and then they they go to New York and it's\nLike you go on the road you travel all that way you get to Madison Square garden you've got an earlier I start time to a game that you're not used to get your Golden State and they still win by almost thirty ... back to back it's crazy you know\nBy the way out Kevin to rent erected a giant billboard to try to recruit him to come there and Kevin ... before he ended up dropping forty one and a victory in New York says yeah that really doesn't do much for me so I got to bring a little bit harder in New York if you want to try to Kevin rats come to the next\nSay come on man you know you want to do something or a good James Dolan to sell the team you're in if you want to get them to get Kevin ... to go to New York at James going to sell the team either that or quit his stupid band JD in a straight shot that band stinks and you could tell James do and I said that\nToo but I Will pass the message along thank you [laughter] I don't know if you have a leader of course if that's what they re doing right now it's five thirty in the morning we are by the way you live coverage of the world series that show you Kiss My math exactly well right now I don't know if you have anybody\nIn your family Who's Afraid of spiders or my sister has a giant beer spiders us I don't know if you have anybody in your family a giant arguing the recognition\nWill be no not at all okay I'm I've I've I've held tarantulas before um uh my my girlfriend is is very afraid of spiders but yes I I Know that those those people are out\nThere so maybe she'll be similar to this gentleman in Fresno war porn reportedly burned down his house tried to kill spiders while you watch a TV station a local TV station or Fresno says firefighters recall tore Fresno housing development earlier this week\nTo pull up to put out too alarmed boys they say there was a man sitting in for his parents in at their house and he tried to kill a black widow that he spotted where they blow torch\n[laughter] that'd be great\nThe attic and the second story of a home or actually damaged by the fire because he was trying to kill the spider and the craziest part is they still don't know if he killed the spider or not it's very possible who's got burned down the house and the spider probably crawled out and got out safely\nOh that's awesome that's like I like the more on who tries to kill the bugs on his windshield with a hammer [laughter]\nI quit it idiots I so each completely burned his house\nDown the brunt of the top story the the addict and an ... and the second story of algebra burned down\n... ... it's just it's not the spider offer pick it up\nAnd I happened to those shoe method yeah I mean you could do a shoe I you know what I Do and this is only for good karma because there's that stat how many spiders you swallow year what is it like a ... to spiders a year the adults in their sleep\nThey swallow spiders um so what I Do just for karma purposes I never kill a spider I always scoop it up and I put it outside because I'm hoping one day I'm being attacked\nOr by like a you know like if I'm In Venezuela and being attacked by a bird so that one of those Venezuelan bird eating spiders can all behind the bird wallets attacking me and put it in like a dark joke or something and that way all those\nYears saving lives will will come in handy\nLater on down the road here rather the spot or eat the bird and then you afterwards that\nDo that is that a a very likely possibility as well to now let's go live to our grew up on a farm and that is not buying into the spider hype insider Iowa sample the latest Sam you're dispelling the rumor that you swallow to spiders a year\nOr I think I read an article that that's pretty much hogwash or that you don't really know how do you come to you like that like you know it's not too when I was growing up that that the number was eight ... fighters cause you you'll sleep with your mouth open and they'll just crawl in there but I think that you might swallow one like once a year maybe\nThere are certain things I don't want to know about it if I if I go to a restaurant I don't want to know the U.S that the cook was playing a pocket pools [laughter] ten minutes before handling my van\nDam which I've always really really nice to ah to ... restaurant we don't mess around with that man of research always super nice yeah 'cause they're handling your food yeah so I put fan but spiders or misunderstood\nYeah of course they are blood blow torch for a spider that's a bit overkill no pun intended now did he did he end up killing the spider the mess\nWe don't know well we wish having no evidence has been found as to whether or not the spider actually survived another more\nOn oh wow well done I think it's got a problem and that was the scraps\nAre Jonah stocks here Fox Sports radio [noise] I Want to let you know we all brought you discover card we treat you like you treat coming up next to

just not no right like you just don't need to do the truth sometimes you know if\nThings are you there it's an old adage you know some things are better left unsaid or unspoken I think that that applies to a lot of things um I think it applies to to certain things in sports\nNow I've talked about this before a lot of scratch yours I had a a just an entire a grip of lotto scratch yours that I'd gotten for Christmas or holidays or or other holidays or birthday or whatever and I'd forgotten about him\nAnd so what I did is when I took him in I put them under the scanner to see whether or not they were still good\nBecause the lotto scratch yours have an expiration and like in small print on the back of a lot of scratcher and I'd forgotten describe I just forgot I forgot I had him and they found him in a drawer and home took a man got 'em scanned to see whether or not they were good and then I found out none of 'em were good and I threw him all the way\nAnd I had a buddy say why didn't you scratch him as a man or it wouldn't have amounted to anything I Would rather not know could you imagine\nScratching one of those off finding out you won like fifty thousand bucks and then you go take 'em to go cash in and the person at seven eleven says oh yeah sorry these are expired\nLike I Would just rather not know like I don't even tell me like it's not just like don't you know I I Would rather certain things you just don't want to know\nI don't need to know it's fine like I also don't need to know how a cow\nBecame my cheeseburger I don't eat it I don't need to\nBe having boneless wings buffalo wild wings and have them show me from birth the chicken\nAnd how it got to my plate next to my Bud Light I don't need it like I mean there's certain things that you just don't need to know right like the I it's the two minute review in the in the NBA the last two minute report dumbest thing they do first of all\nWhat's the point\nYou can't go back you can't correct it you can't take back the point you can't take back the when the last what it does nothing and then you expose your officiating crew as being flawed and making mistakes the most important part of the game so there's two minute report to the NBA does\nLike just why we wish there were two what even come out with that watch the games over toothpaste tube you can't do anything about it\nIt's done\nBut it's just you don't need to know like I don't need to know what was on those waters scratch or is it wouldn't have done me any good to throw away the hell out of my face and I don't need to know I don't want to know\nI I don't I don't need to know what happened to the cow on its way to my plate before turned into a cheeseburger I just don't need to know that stuff all the NFL has decided\nTo ah well they're going to ignore all that and they decided to come out uh with uh a little something on friday\nRight so the NFL acknowledged on friday that there was an Arab whistle and it cost the browns a fumble recovery and they're over time lost to the raiders on Sunday\nNow if you remember there were a lot of odd plays in that game and buy on I mean crap calls in that game um you know the spot\nRoughing the passer so on so forth very very bizarre game but the call came I guess there was a little under seven minutes left in regulation their car lost control the ball miles Garrett recovered it I'm\n... and and he was hit on the thirtieth yard line Garret recovered it and he became running towards the end zone but the referee had blown in errant whistle\nBecause he thought cars for progress will stop now the NFL comes out and says a as a matter of fact uh we ruled the pastor's stop for forward progress and we killed to play this is not for progress obviously this is a fumble we should not have blowing\nThe whistle okay why are you telling me that we lost the game like I don't need to know that\nI still I don't get this stuff I did the two minute report in the NBA this crap we don't need to know man\nYou don't need to release the information that does nothing could you imagine if you're a gambler if you're a a degenerate funky gambler and you're the browns and the money in line for like fifty Fifteen thousand dollars\nLike you're eating Rahman and drinking out of a coy pond\nBecause you blew all your money on that game only to find out that the Russian Blue the call late and I had an impact on how the game went\nI I don't like what what point does this do anybody any good I Would just rather not know\nIf your wife calls you up and said hey by the way honey I'm having an affair is your first question who'll give me as a measurement\n[laughter] I don't want to know bad I guess I don't need that [laughter] [laughter] yeah oh God he how is he no I don't I don't need to know like it did to over done we're done here we don't need this crap if I'm a browns fan this is nothing for me\nGreat you guys for the call cool I feel even worse about myself I don't like I just don't need this nothing good comes of this stuff and the NBA does it and the NFL does\nNothing good comes of this stuff and the NBA does it and the NFL doesn't we're trying to be transparent no\nYou're trying to over corrected by over correcting it's a problem now now everybody feels like they got screwed now there's conspiracies out\nI just me and it it it's at a certain point I Would just rather like let's just move on man it just move on it just it it's over it's just like we just we just got to move on I'm like hey babe I I heard a rumor yeah what's going on yeah I heard you slept with for my friends\nYeah I did oh that's cool um so who is the best one through four what's your Mount Rushmore my friends well what would you say as a better in bed ... what go ahead

frustrated the giants are one in three he's got no touchdowns he's fits in the league interceptions but he's not been in the end zone yet although back them decided to open up a little bit\nAnd now

I Love Fox Fox college football I think does the best job on my radio wife Brady Quinn a calls games for Fox but let me tell you something man when that CBS SEC music comes on\nI don't it just does something to me I I I don't it it just you start thinking back you start all those it just feels like Saturdays in the fall\nTwelve thirty kickoff out here in Southern California SEC covering college football in the south you hear the music you just it it just I don't every single week like that it seems like a damn good game I don't know if it's just the SEC or whatnot but every single week\nThe SEC rolls out a decent games he can criticize Nick Saban eight and criticize the SEC and their non conference schedule and all that stuff but when you hear the ah\nAh SEC music on CBS damn\nJust do something to yeah um and I was talking about this last week now I think about the big tent traditionalist college football you know sometimes you think about man things are so good back when you were a child or I used to remember this place and I was younger and everything seems like it\nWas better all these years later when if you really think back and maybe it wasn't even that great at all you're just sort of romanticizing your youth\nUm I did that last week\nI was talking about man I Wish Big Ten football would have their best games on earlier in the day and then a few hours or a few hours later one of the best Big Ten football games on the best football games period Penn State Ohio State kicked off on Saturday Night so I was proven wrong\nI grew up on Miami, Florida state\nHow many people actually realized at Florida State in Miami were playing this weekend\nI I grew up on that some of the great games you could ever imagine in college football season where Miami, Florida state and how awesome they were and every time those teams played it went down to the wire there was a wide right wide laughed incredible play's incredible players\nI mean they're playing on Saturday I don't even know how many people even know or care and yeah it speaks to Florida state's not what everybody thought they were and you know Miami football isn't what it used to be but damn man I I remember those were being some of the great games in college football\nSo All right uh and by the way a ... I mentioned my radio ... he will be on the call for eastern time on Fox a number three Ohio Ohio State and uh and Indiana so odd why do you do\nYou guys have CBS or is that what you're getting me too I don't know I'm being yelled at and the other studio or so I'm All right Jonah socks Fox Sports radio comedy live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios alright so piece of trash talk here on our focus our we have a a piece of trash talk here on Fox Sports radio\nSo\nSeattle wants to NBA team right Seattle wants an MBA team and daddy preseason game in Seattle on ... on friday night so they went back Golden State playing the Sacramento Kings\nAnd so it was the first game at the ... in Seattle since the sonics left first an NBA game\nPre season or not since the sonics less Seattle to moved to Oklahoma City so Kevin to rant showed up to the game he was wearing a sonics Jersey old school I Believe is Shawn Kemp Jersey I'm the fans are all their old school sonic than it was really really great 'cause I grew up the sonnet or a big deal\nSo they go back they played this game on friday night everybody's all about man let's we've got to get a team here there's talks about hockey team going there gotta get basketball in in the city of Seattle you know it's a shame that they left they went to Oklahoma City look what they could have been\nLegendary franchise so many great players what a bummer and see you see all this you know man this is just just great great great stuff in the city Seattle\nThat it is not unusual for players details seems that there are a wife and they're a girlfriend will both be attending basketball games and other teams meet that information to make sure that the women are seated as far apart as possible\nOkay um first of all I'm not surprised that\nMBA players have wives and girlfriends or professional athletes have wives and girlfriends that I'm not surprised be surprised if they did know yes I mean everybody knows that\nYou you've you've heard the stories I actually remember this he'd make their order just on a fortunate murder or ... who I mean there's that led murder suicide ... there's a lot of details that that don't add up but I remember\n... and if you talk to players um they'll they'll say yeah I Know guys who completely shaped up after that that scared them in thinking man I I'm I'm being foolish I'm fooling around them going behind my wife's back\nHow do I know I'm not going to burn a bridge and something like this could happen like that scared a lot of guys 'cause that was the guy who was fooling around on his wife and\nShe got attached and he's sleeping on fourth of July in his\nYou know a ... pad or how see out on the side some in apartment he had on the side and she walked in and and blue is brains out and then\nAnd then killed herself so that she would land on him and they could be together forever that right there is next level stuff scary yet but it doesn't usually so I'm not surprised at these athletes have a wife and a girl friend here's here's the most amazing part of that whole store ... how\nThe audacity the arrogance to not just say you know maybe you should sit this one out no no no no yeah you can come and don't worry all just send them\nFar enough apart to where they don't know that nothing's going on nobody will have any idea that they both have something in common and it to me like how do you like just imagine being that arrogant to think you know I'll just I can get away with this they'll all be in the same room as long as they're a little farther apart we're all good here\nI Would think a lot of these guys get thrill out of it you know every once in a wife but their girlfriend the size pieces in the corner they give her like little wink or something you know what I mean\nYeah like I don't know I think that's honestly why some celebrities a drink and drive\nIt's not like they can't afford a new birth it's not like they can't afford a limo or or or even a a helicopter to take them from one part of the next I just think it's the whole the thrill of it there's there's a certain thrilled to it and it's all yeah can I get away with this like your ego is so out\nOf whack that you actually think it's a good idea to see your wife and your girlfriend in the same arena not that far apart from each other\n[noise] I mean like somebody's got to know something right they could just man that's crazy\nThing is you can put them both like in the same section one like on ... up in one and rosy and just point there and they and now they're all know which one you're pointing to I mean you got above covered\nIf you're going to go that far too to adjust\nTo showcase what it is you're working with yeah I mean at that point you may as well just have them sitting right next to each other\nSince even get away with it right on and say I wonder if I Wonder if guys have done that just to see if if there's no way that they'll know anything or maybe the girlfriend knows about the wife but not vice versa and then that's insane if\nIt is it is there's another one a policeman harbor Michigan currently investigating how a batch of twelve we laced brownies were distributed at a high school\nNow Harper patrolman Michael prince who's investigating it\nSaid that uh several students receive brownies laced with marijuana and many of them were distributed\nBy a girl who was running for homecoming queen in hopes of winning votes [noise] she gave out pot brownie you gave up her brownies to twelve students many of them football players apparently believing that she could\nBuy their influence and uh when the homecoming foes does she when that was not good for the authority unfortunately\nShe gave out pot brownie from like the I've heard a like a hundred dollar hand shake or something like that but like here although we put a bunch a hippie lettuce inside some brownie mix from Safeway and let me past these out so I can try and win win the award now\nThe hell is that the ... brown is all that's not really must be but I'll say this and she was running from coming queen at my high school she would have won running away all all you got a lot of hot as hell yeah oh yeah I mean a lot of guys kicking in Hackensack\nAround all the time out like skunks there the back of the science burden was smoking for a completely different reason it was a different kind of chemist oh yeah well there rather than a lot of people a a tickle in God's feet in late yeah Aloul either that\nOr a Kevin figures or try to get a homecoming queen nomination Manhattan\nOut a pop around ... oh no I just say it was me I guess that I knew somebody who would have now that she got the idea from your point fingers at I'm just sorry that was a Dutch boy yeah I'm the anonymous MBA gee how is your is your other job falling out MBA players that are over there having wife's inside peace in the same game together [laughter]\nOr they have no problem

more odd car insurance visit Geico dot com for a free rate\nQuote um there are ... and look\nI'll be honest with you I wanted this to be true too I did\nI wanted to believe and I wanted to buy into it I'm partly to blame for it and your partly to blame for it as well too and I think at least acknowledging what it is that we did wrong and our part in the unraveling of an NFL franchise I think at least if we acknowledge that\nWe can sort of start to mend and and he'll and recover from the damage that it's done because as it stands right now there is somebody who has taken a beating for the status of an NFL franchise\nThat somebody is John group [noise] and I was mentioning this before that we are partly to blame in a couple of areas when it comes to the demise of the Oakland Raiders or the status of the Oakland Raiders or how bad the Oakland Raiders are because they are the butt of every joke in the NFL\nI'm John ... gets mocked and ridicule that every single\nPress conference anytime he mentions not having a pass rush or somebody goes\nBut you have a job in Detroit you\nKnow that same tired actor tired routine that people's view out on social media\nAnd so John ... getting all the heat\nHe's getting ripped for it and so the news comes out that Marshall Lynch is is is possibly done for the year it's another blow in a series of blows in a bad season for the Oakland\nRaiders and I think that if you actually look deeper\nIt's our expectations that got us to this point with the raiders because the only reason we all assume that the raiders were the next big thing in the NFL is based on one season\nSo the story is in two thousand Eighteen for the raiders this story really is twenty sixteen when the raiders were twelve and for when the raiders went to the playoffs when the raiders suffered\nA terrible break no pun intended to Derrick in their car\nAnd had to go into battle with Conor cook against the Houston Texans and we know how that played out but everybody came out of that game thinking a don't worry about it yet sucks their car wasn't there everybody came out today but\nThey're built for the future this seems built to last to get a franchise quarterback they've got an elite past Russia they got an a superstar wide receiver this seems built to last\nOut here in LA we were pissed off three teams are relocating we got the two worst chargers in rams\nThe team that was on the rise the raiders we were so pissed man we can't even get that right ... luckily lucky for Vegas\nBut the fact is we all assume that this team was great because of one season\nAnd now when you have a little time to reflect and you have a little time to look deeper into things you realized yet twenty sixteen wasn't all it was cracked up to be you see the raiders were twelve and for that year nine of their twelve wins we're what by one possession or less\nIn fact there were a couple of games that they won by appoint a single point week one against the saints how did the raiders win that game or they went for two late\nFlip a coin\nA couple of weeks later one in Baltimore\nBut they were trailing late night game in fact the raiders only played eight games all season against teams with a winning record they played three playoff teams that year\nThere were one in three because they played Kansas City twice or oh and they lost the Kansas City both times but they did beat\n... while they're in the Texans you know ... the same guy who was a disaster he was one of the laughing stocks that year of the NFL because he was a member of the Houston Texans and he took all that money to go to Houston and he burned the Denver Broncos and as it turns out he stunk\nOf the joint like that team wasn't all it was cracked up to be we just thought it was that's on us we overrated the raiders I always say when\nWe go get the most disappointed in life when our expectations are way too high for things it's the difference between getting flakes on by somebody who's dependable and getting flake on by a flake you expect it when it's a flake you bake that into whatever your ... thought processes up upon their arrival time\nOr when they're going to show up or if they're actually going to show up\nA Mike says he's going to be here by thirty but you know it's my kill probably nine Fifteen or ten o'clock\nBut what if somebody dependable who doesn't do that in our expectations are really really high that it hurts the most our expectations were way too high for the raiders that was a fluke here\nWe assume they were the next big thing but if he actually took a deeper dive you realize a lot of things went there a way that year and so now John Bruton\nThe guy getting the blame for because John Bruno how dare he trade away ... back him in how dare he traded away that guy you know the guy that they offered a boatload of money too and they thought they had a deal done\nI did they offered a boatload of money too and they thought they had a deal done and all of a sudden the Aaron Donald signed his contract and the raiders came back for more and then they decided yet we can't go\nThat high so they treated them away because\nThe way John ... and looked at it won't mean if we're not going to be a playoff team with clue Mac why don't we keep them around when I can actually cash in and make some you know get something back\nFor a guy in his prime\nYeah but it's just it's Reggie McKenzie is guys like he's going after Reggie McKenzie guys before John Gurdon got their Reggie mackenzie says five years with the raiders organization they were thirty six and sixty\nBoy what a group of guys that is\nBut I don't think that our expectations are the only reason why we are to blame because clearly we were wrong about that I think we just really really were happy to have the raiders back and I'm\nGuilty of a new book man [noise]\nI don't hide it [noise] the lie him raises the rebellious attitude\nOf certain ... from see Conor McGregor so mixed save in all of our favorites\nHere on the show all have a common denominator is with a B sometimes they're in a ... and the raiders had a reputation with the same growing up you always heard about the old school raider was violent they were called\nDon't you know there are still under an episode of health goes by\nThat I Do I feel like you say that your wife secret about ... hill the most expensive basketball sneaker on the market let let me read what the ah the desire to be four Ninety five price pointed to the goal of being previewed\nDisrupting keep the gold make people look up the the audacity and the swagger paintball Iran at the fact that we can do even do that as a lot about the fact that a little bit more than anything else I mean maybe even know if he believes what he just said no\nI mean really I I'm looking at this going these are all famous seekers from the past and here it is one\nTo get the rest of what Jason Smith and my comment that pod cast in by searching the G ... Smith show when Mike harm it\nAlways hear that you didn't match what might harm in week night to me I mean if they're big right here on Fox Sports radio\nLeads to our coverage with clay trap NBA\nRatings on opening night we're down thirty seven percent [noise] and I think a big reason why that happened was because well brawn James was not playing on the east coast anymore in the NBA guy used to this idea that they were going to have the ability to really take advantage of all abroad Advil wheat in for everybody on the west\nCoast I'll check that coverage with clay tribe and they say yeah I mean there are three I'm back on Fox Sports radio ...\n... ... rockets didn't get better they just got older prisons Paul whose race down every year when even the most got a year older they bring in Carmelo Anthony who was just a year old and still really can't play but somehow continues or find guys\nTo poison the rockets did not get better so I'm not surprised that they take a downturn this year ...\nMike ...\nPound boxes ... all of the NBA is ah\nTo me the most type ... than ever ... are you in\nBecause we are down the far\nDo I have I have to wait and to make use [noise] we\nA camera but here as we covered that when you see on a on a on Fox Sports radio Thursday off by the Houston Texans looked at take down to Miami do\n... in tax\nThursday at seven thirty there not by now [noise]\n\n... Fox Sports radio um\nHow many alive even the guy go Fox Sports radio studios are\nUp in less than ten minutes from now here on our pets are will have the scraps\nOf that is where we uh go there some stories maybe we missed around the world of sports or we will have those plus uh you know usually one or two stories that could potentially get us fired\nSo we or walk the walk the plank you're on Fox Sports radio and try and save our jobs in the process so that'll be coming up here a less than ten minutes to pronounce your on Fox Sports radio\nSo that'll be coming up here a less than ten minutes to a firm now here on Fox Sports radio uh sometimes people are really really\nBad at a at listening really bad it's um\nIt's actually like no no matter how many times you try and put qualifiers into something to be very clear about it\nI'm Still some of you guys are awful at listening [laughter] I I don't like it it it really is amazing so I was making this point last hour on the show about often to blind play in the NFL\nAnd my point was if you want to just look at the teams in the NFL\nBetter ranked are like six of the top nine teams in the NFL and so that the way that I presented it was if\nI were to say to you one of these teams won the super bowl\nYou wouldn't be surprised ... most of us that are at least sober coherent and logical if I said that one of these of the following teams\nWas going to win the super bowl you wouldn't be surprised by it and the teams are the patriots\nWouldn't be surprised if the patriots won the super bowl the Steelers you wouldn't be surprised the Steelers when the super bowl you wouldn't be surprised the saints won the super bowl if the rams won the Superbowl if the eagles won the super bowl again or the Packers because they may have the best quarterback in the league\nLike you wouldn't be surprised by any of those teams winning the super bowl those are all either preseason popular Superbowl picks\nFor teams that have already won the Superbowl recently\nLike none of those teams would surprise you\nPatriots Steelers saints rams eagles were Packers none of them would surprise you if they did in fact when the super bowl the reason I brought those teams up\nIs because those teams are all in the top nine according to pro football focus\nWho ranked every ... offensive line in the NFL so far this season six of the uh those those teams are on the top nine all six and four of those teams are on the top five and my point was\nThat often so blind play is still important it's still a big deal and so that's not just\nA coincidence there like offensive line play is a is a big factor into success for off fences and teams in the NFL you wonder why the Arizona Cardinals are bad they're ranked dead last and they're often says atrocious and of course because some of you guys are not good at\nListening I'm this guy writes in\nRavens Phillies ramps Steelers patch chiefs pass because of the patch and chiefs Packers stink saints get beat by raven Sunday\nWho asked you what do you what are you hearing\nThat the point is there are six teams I just throw him out there I gave you plenty of qualifiers and still you guys get so emotional about this stuff that if your team is disrespected at any point during the during the process even if it's just\nHypothetical you still attack\nPut the booze doubt that's almost say listen put the booze down it's late enough you've had enough to drink either that or share them share some boos give me some\nMan I I don't know how difficult distance for some people\nRight Jonah socks Fox Sports radio um so I was talking about this earlier that I got to hypnotize by the MBA and I didn't even know it [noise] um I was more in to the Thursday night debut of LeBron James with the Lakers\nThat I was Thursday Night Football now look there was a dog ask game everybody knows that I mean I'd rather uh pay twenty bucks and watch to homeless people throw up on each other a than than watch profit or ... cardinals again for free that was terrible and awful football game\nUm so I acknowledged that um but you also ... going on\nAnd I was more into LeBron James is debut at the Lakers and I wasn't anything else\nLike I ... it didn't meant like ... Thursday night game could have been a great game I probably would have still lean towards LeBron James and the Lakers and I was totally hypnotized by the NFL because I poked fun at the end at the MBA um I ... and and I poke fun at what they do and I was hypnotized by the MBA in this regard because\nThey try and throw out all these garbage stories\nI mean we've got the season underway and all the talk by some people try and force feed you these stories are or what about showing show who may go to the next at the end of the year oh what about nuts free agency Kiss My asked what about this season sunny but underway and you guys are already talking about which do superstars are going to team up for the next\n... ... what are we doing All right do you have that\nLittle confidence in your regular season that you're only focused on the off season\nBut man all the talk during the off season all the hype about LeBron James and the Lakers at work I cared more about that than I did Thursday Night Football or the American league championship series which was the deciding game in which Boston went on to the world series\nAnd both of those played second fiddle and third fit all to the NBA which was LeBron James making his debut for the Lakers\nAnd it was all that hype that I didn't think they had an impact on me\nAnd it did\nAnd it's it's great for the MBA cars look I poke fun at the NBA because of the the the stories in the path of aggressiveness by some MBA players is is just too much bad way too much drama it's over the top it's ridiculous\nBut I also do it because look let's have an honest conversation about it I think there's some\nReally good reporters an analyst to cover the MBA and then I think there are a lot of fan boys and girls\nI mean a lot of pom pom waivers a uh a lot of uh a lot of uh\nWhile I Would think I mean look this is a chance for the Dodgers to go back to back World Series they have not won a World Series championship since Nineteen eighty eight\nI mean it's pretty easy for me if it were me I Will be trained and again it's not that bad ourselves on the back here Fox Sports radio and EPA's won by me to the game seven of it you know so yes for the Dodgers I Would imagine that would have a little bit more important\nThan the game number two of which will be many of the brawn James playing in the Los Angeles Lakers uniform I understand the significance of it it's a star player in the city of LA\nBut it's the second game of the regular season versus the opportunity to go to the fall classic\nI don't see how there's much of a comparison so if it were me and say I couldn't go to a sports bar I Would have oh I have my eyes trained and focus on each and every pitch in Oso yes well periodically checking in to see what's going on with the ...\nYeah but ... it's LA man you know we've been here our entire lives uh they have an affinity for new and shiny things sister and that's LeBron and this team could be for one eighty one and this is their last chance to win a game and I I think there's going to be a large\nPortion that are are going to be so in tune with that and ... it's the first game and if\nThe Dodgers are getting blown out at that point oh yeah uh all all the\nBandwagon Dodger fans are going to go ahead and turn those a Dodger hats inside out and\nTry and turn into Laker fans all of a sudden a it's a great fan base but you know this and look I was making this thing this earlier\nNobody goes from high to low faster than Dodger fans of anybody I've ever seen to where they were mad was over and they were cocky and we've had crickets since the last game six 'cause everybody so nervous\nTo roller coaster of emotions they do and what our Dodger fans out here trust me we talk to them every day and our local affiliate I Know how it goes\nUp some NFL or the Jacksonville Jaguars lived a pretty charmed life last season now so much this year they've been struggling\nLast through the last four and got absolutely both raised by the Dallas Cowboys last week in a big reason why that is the fact that little for another place this week one\nThey're going to be out again this week as he nurses that hamstring injury um I don't know if there's any way any light at the end of the ... for the Jacksonville Jaguars this season if so it might be a train coming but obviously all come on disappointing I'm Sorry I'm just being honest just be an artist Jonas\n... obviously a disappointing season for people for the people about what's going to take a next step\nAnd they were taking about what three or four steps backwards more there were last year\nUm ... I mean they're tied with Tennessee in Houston, Tennessee is so bad yeah Marcus Mario with us thanks sorry guys that I and I know we can make as many excuses one he's not very good Houston's got no business being three in three I still think Jacksonville is going to win the division\nSo most disappointing part of all this is now jailing Ramsey isn't talking\nTo solve the book I I mean if you're not doing that what's the point man like nobody nobody goes to see a comedy special and the comedian just doesn't tell jokes like if I'm going to see Andrew dice clay\nI'm going there to see some of the rhymes I I'm not I'm not going there to have them read poetry do not come on man like your jak wars nobody's going there for ... Ramsey talk trash\nThat's a dark comedy watching Blake borders play the quarterback position that's what\nThat is well I don't know why race had to be brought into it was just wanted a dark ...

com for a free rape\nQuote so uh we've got four games in\nCollege football and I had four games in college football um and they're all\nImportant for one reason or another right because you've got\nThree games that ... top twenty five teams going against each other as everybody is sort of jockeying for position because we've got the college football playoff which will be coming out I'm In a couple of weeks or now\nWhich is always fun and it's always a hot topic and it basically saved a Wednesday's during the football season for sports talk radio host because Wednesday there's not really a whole lot going on so when you could ... it kept the college football playoff committee selection for the Tuesday night before\nIt'll save a lot of people's ah shows on a Wednesday and so teams are trying to jockeying for position and so there's four\nGames that I think are the most important games right here so the first one you've got number to Georgia number Thirteen LSU so that's the\nCBS SEC game that's going to be a fun one eye LSU last they're going to be pissed off\nYou know a a Baton Rouge is going to be ... is going to be rolling their ah Death Valley it's going to be awesome that's going to be a fun game to watch you've got Washington and Oregon number seven Washington at number Seventeen Oregon Justin Herbert I don't know look man I'm not trying to pretend like I'm some quarterback whisper\nI have no idea how how he translates to the pros I leave that to to the professionals to break that stuff down but I'll say this I watch them make a couple of throws this season that guy's got a real arm and he looks like it'd be you're a real player at the NFL\nSo if you're a giant fan walking watching on Thursday night and you're trying to figure out who the quarterback of the future is maybe it's not ... your fourth round pick\nMaybe it's not Alex Tenney maybe he's playing up at ... stadium and you can watch 'em up coming up on Saturday ah and then\nThe third game is never Nineteen Colorado at USC it's ten thirty eastern time kick off on Fox Sports one\nThe only reason I bring that up is because my radio wife ... will be on the call\nIn that game at the coliseum I mean he couldn't come by the studio and hang out with me [laughter]\nLike why are you know why not I mean yeah I just I always seemed like three times a year ... what do you want to come by and hang out with me you know just go to your game and that and get the hell out of my state while you're at it but as we've got that\nThe game that I Want to focus on is the one and I kept by the way the British are a good dude he's a friend who just joking so don't don't run run in cattle to them on social media you rats are to the game that I Want to get to is\nWisconsin and Michigan [noise]\nSo the

anything anywhere\nBlah blah blah blah blah I was in Hawaii when they last\nWeek one to Notre Dame and that's not bragging I'm saying that because I actually wanted to see what some of the reaction was because I watch the game at the hotel bar you know it was pulling one of those uh where I Would tell my girlfriend uh am gonna run downstairs and get towels\nAnd then one of the trips I a halfway up I forgot that I didn't get towels so I had to go back and grab somebody's talented break it up like actually went down there to do something worthwhile when reality was I was just having a a Michel ... two beers and I was smoking them as fast as I go to run back upstairs but um\nAnd who hasn't done that\nBut I I was watching it and and I'm looking through just seeing as I'm watching the game play out and Notre Dame at home week one great environment people are fired up for the game and Notre Dame is dominating the line of scrimmage\nAnd I'm watching I'm seeing some of the reaction on social media and I ... I knew it was going to happen and I just wanted to make sure that everything was confirmed and it's like the the game wasn't even over and everybody was all ready firing\nOff ... hot takes already just ripping Jim Harbaugh eased overrated Michigan what a shock I there was supposed to have a quarterback this year getting crushed\nAnd I'm watching I'm just making the no ... to keep to myself thinking okay well let's just wait and see how the season turns out or as it turns out Notre Dame is pretty damn good if Notre Dame wins out they're going to the college football playoff period as it turns out Notre Dame ... pretty damn good\nMichigan was in that game for most of that game on the road in South bend in a crazy environment week one of the season or crazy things happened week one in the NFL and college football\nSince that game and all the horrible hot takes Michigan is five and ... and they ... their opponents two hundred twelve to Seventy one\nI get it\nNot the greatest strength of schedule over that time it's not like he's playing powerhouse programs during that time but don't you want to have big games to look forward to honestly think don't you want to root for that if your team's not in it\nIf your team's nowhere close to being a top ...\nIf your team's nowhere close to being a top program in college football or if your team is it in the NFL playoffs don't you at least want to see a good game ...

ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio uh I'm Still waiting by the way to get in reports of what the hell this burger joint was in Milwaukee\nApparently this was put into play years and years ago like in the Nineteen forties or something where a burger joint\nNamed George Web in Wisconsin if the brewers won twelve straight games will be giving out free burgers in Nineteen eighty seven they give out like a over a hundred and sixty thousand free burgers apparently they are going to be doing that upcoming on Thursday because the brewers beat the Dodgers in game one of the ... and I'll see

do better than this these are the reviews on a on George Web that we've gotten so far\nI have a little bit of a just the music here because this is a this is good stuff little little bit of the music here's agreed off some of the reviews of George Web a burger joint\nThat nobody had ever heard of before this promotion popped up and started making news on friday there we go [noise]\nThe Ben mellor show talked about that ... restaurant last week that's the only reason I have heard of it [noise]\nThe Web is fantastic better breakfast and burgers though [noise]\nJak Web nothing but the facts

coming up Thursday from Milwaukee Brewers fan [noise]\nAh forcing their team wins drought twelve straight games so congratulations enjoy the burger um it's free\nWhich is code for you'll never go back to pay for one so enjoy that on Thursday All right no I agree [noise] I don't know if anybody else does this but sometimes you'll see something and you immediately think a one person\nI get so it'll happen on this show from time to time we talk about Conan A beer so much because it's one of my favorite breweries\nAnd so people send me pictures when they're drinking like a big wave or along words the Hawaiian ... but it's awesome great beers I don't think they have a bad beer um and so people whenever they see Conan beer\nThey'll send me a picture of them drinking a beer\nAnd there's just certain things to where you see it and you immediately think of one person\nYou'll beat an airport and you see a coffee mug or T shirt or something like that\nYou'll beat an airport and you see a coffee mug or T shirt or something like that and the gift shop and you think of one person to take a picture and send it to him you'll see a street sign\nA you you have a buddy whose last name is Louis and you're passing Lewis wrote and you'll send a picture of it like this happens from time to time like when there's anything Iowa related I immediately think of Iowa Sam our technical producer\nWhich I don't like because I hate his guts and he's an alcoholic but\nHe used to non Amish with Iowa it's it's ... ... ... put in my mind is planted there it's a stamp whenever I see anything Iowa related I used to think field of dreams that's all been wiped out it is now Iowa stay on my technical producer 'cause he's a friend of mine and I see them every single weekend\nBut I was watching Thursday night and I'll be honest with you\nThe only person I could think of while I was watching Thursday Night Football was Ben Mac do that's probably something I shouldn't have admitted on the air that sounds a little creepy that I was thinking about bend Mac or do or watching a football game but just think about what went down last year\nBen Mac do\nAfter his team went to the playoffs the year before after you took over for Tom Coughlin\nAnd they lost in the playoff game gets the Green Bay Packers bed Mac do goes into last season and there was a lot of promise there was a lot of people that actually like the giants to win the NFC ISI year ago\nAnd vent Mac do dealt with an injury to his best wide receiver and often civil line that was a roast shifts and that's putting it mildly\nAn inconsistent defense with all sorts of dysfunction guys and the secondary calling each other out like all of that stuff\nSo Ben Mac do later in the season what did he get Gino Smith a look\nSo he approaches Eli Manning and he says hey I Want to keep your consecutive starts street going but in Oakland at half time I'd like to put Gino and to get him some work and he lie manning said no either he starting\nOr I'm not coming out of the game I don't like how this feels so Ben Mac do started Gino Smith and Eli Manning\nWas emotional talking about it and he had tears in his eyes and all of this stuff\nAnd ... you made the tough choice he made the tough call\nAnd he got clipped for it got fired organization through one of the bus got buried for it crushed I backed bin ... a year ago he gave Eli Manning the option\nYou made it could have started and come out of the half time and I sort of give you lie manning a little bit of credit as well too 'cause he didn't want it to feel artificial and I totally get it but it's not like Ben ... said hey man FU you're sitting this one out and I'm putting in Gino Smith\nNo he gave me the option listen we understand how much the consecutive starts streak means to you I don't want to take that away from you but I Do want to give Gina Smith another look he's been playing while in practice\nThat was the thinking behind it and you're going to Oakland and Eli Manning said no I don't want any part of it\nAnd the organization through Macedonia under the bus fired him cleaned house everybody rallied around ... poor you lie manning how dare you snapped his consecutive wins St ... consecutive starts streak rather how dare you do that Ben Mac do and now here they are still a disaster\nStill drama still dysfunction\nAnd bend Mac who gets to kick back and have a diet right and watched that game on Thursday and go [laughter] I guess I wasn't the problem\nBut here's the thing about the giants bend Mac do was just one example of what the organization is\nTheir heat checkers their temperature takers that's what the giants are\nMac who made the call last year with Eli Manning he made the tough call that nobody wanted to make their because his last name's manning anyone you a couple of Super Bowls and what did the giants do\nThey fired him last may giants\nOwner John Mara was talking with the M M QB ... nobody's brought this up John Mars talking with the M M QB about the possibility of signing Colin Kaepernick and these are quotes from John Mara quote\nAll my years of being in the league I've never received more emotional mail from people\nThat I did about that issue if any of your players ever do that take any we're never coming to another giants game it wasn't one or two letters it was a lot\nIt's an emotional emotional issue for a lot of people more so than any other issue I've run into and quote so let me get this straight\n\nBecause some fans told you they weren't going to come to your football games\nThat's why you wouldn't entertain the idea of sighing signing Colin Kaepernick are having to your players taking me\nIf I was John ... and I said at the time I Would have said oh you don't want to come to the games I don't care don't show up there's there's a season ticket waiting list for years long somebody will be right there to take your spot\nBut he didn't do that because he's a temperature taker their their seat checkers that's what they do\nThey take the temperature of the public and the media and then they proceed\nYou've got multiple examples of it they fired a head coach for daring to sit on the line manning it half the time of the game because it got negative backlash from the media\nThe season and the idea that you should still be putting up these great numbers that he did his rookie years just unrealistic\nYeah really is I I just I I I I don't understand now the petition to bring back Tony Romo mhm [noise]\nI was a so I was watching the Tony Romo football life documentary I have ever going to be out you know it's it's actually really good um Fox Sports radio makes an appearance on the uh Tony Romo documentary oh somebody sent out a tweet like they did a screen shot one of the reviews of Tony Romo Z I early games as a broadcaster\nAnd it was a quote from the Fox sports radio Twitter account that said I'm Tony Romo is the home run already a as a broadcaster and uh that clearly meant\nThat they didn't hear a my show with Brady Quinn because we have crushed ... several days\nBecause of some of the calls he's made but uh we're getting more religious teasing we're just spreading balls but um yeah it's it's pretty good but I don't I don't think he has any interest in going back then I don't think so either I think he said I I think there was an offer on the table and I heard there was an offer on the table from the Houston Texans\nUm if you wanted to go back there but I just don't think he would walk back and I've heard that his relationship with Jason Garrett is not good they were really really close to hung out all the time together and after the jak Prescott decision was made to making the starter\nTony Romo was so pissed off that he wasn't even given a chance to compete for the job that that image Jason Garrett have not been the same sense so\nTo then you're making you have a cushy job sitting next to Jim Nance making a lot of money why would you want to go back down there and have J what snap your\nBack and a half again and he had bad injury yes a lot of injuries in the pro down some of the injuries you got in his career tough dude man and he was a good quarterback I don't even really was what he says he was I thought he was so misunderstood and so under rated 'cause he's the cowboys quarterback everybody hated us that that's a problem\nWhen he had enough talent around him when he had a legitimate running game where they are they're fourteen ensued that you're demaio Murray who not work at Fox is an analyst at that excellent Seventy are rushing year that was the year that the desert Brian catch ... Green Bay I mean they're on their way possible to go on to the super bowl that\nA perfect team that season yup enrollment was she was one of the best years of his career\nYet they were good team or his fourth quarter numbers are amongst the best history of the league I just think he he gets a bad knock 'em you know the because he's a cowboys quarterback in because uh you know ... ... ... ... people assume that he was fake ways enthusiasm but no I always thought he was really can\nSome will never forget the or the botched nap in Seattle yeah and that that playoff game heart out\nI Would have ... to man up all looks that looked like somebody at a blown not rock I think that's why it's you know that was going to look at the tape\nNo doubt a one more forage I got to hear a leafy Merkel of Raleigh North Carolina he passed away earlier this week uh he was a big Buffalo Bills fan and a lot and those obituary reads quote\nWe has requested six Buffalo Bills players as Paul bears so they can let him down one last time [laughter]\nOh yeah [laughter] wrong is that\nAnd they're fairly Mr Merkel\nWent through all four of air a Super Bowl mosses there for ... or above the\nWith attended every last one of the big long suffering bills fan in every sense of the word\nOutlook this is a topic we can get into a died during like July when there's nothing else to talk about we don't want to break down the all star game but I\nStill think the those bills teams I still call that a dynasty easily yeah Boris rate Superbowl people that say no you don't win one man no B. S. four\nStraight Super Bowl to get over the disappointment and to get there four times in a row that's nothing dynasties ridiculous now it's a dynasty so listen we don't need to do a\n... and we're not gonna let Sam's negative energy or feed into this segment any more than ... already has a\nBike call the dynasty I really do I I and if you watch the documentary the four falls of buffalo how devastated Scott Norwood to this day still is oh yeah\nLike he is devastated he was a good kicker and he won a lot of games for him but he just missed that one kicking in his life was never the same reason\nI wasn't a chips chip shadows what forty five yards was eleven I mean come on yeah forty seven guys are missing extra points at thirty three yards today what are we talking about\nYeah it's a man yeah that's that's right but the bills can let him down and let them go to that that is real good by the way I was gonna say um be careful\nAfter you pass having former Buffalo Bills around um 'cause the last time that happened Ritchie incognito was in a a funeral home and he was requesting to remove his father's head\nSo it's just saying yeah\nScraps no problem [noise]\nIs raw militia [noise]\n\n\nBe a professional here I joined us X. box portrayed and going to let the shenanigans take over the show where these immature people I work with are coming up next year on up I saw a a people have said some nasty things in the world of sports you'll hear all of them even some things that you never thought you would hear those are all coming up next year on Fox Sports
