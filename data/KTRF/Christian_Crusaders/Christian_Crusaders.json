was and these are the ... century listening to a century where I Would go into a region we have a\nWe have a state wide reach we as I said a thirty seven institutions are spread over forty seven different communities and have fifty four different campuses so we had in every part of the state sometimes we get to metro centric\nIn just staying in the twin cities as important as that is because the majority of our population is it but it also makes sense to reach out to other parts of the state\nTalk to the local businesses there with the help of institutions and colleges and universities doctor the businesses chambers of commerce legislators other community leaders in the nonprofit space we're focused on what development\nAnd just being a listening mode understand what is working for them we had our colleges and universities are deliberating for the need to understand where the gaps are\nParticularly with regard to how much your job than the margin was closed shortages and then work without colleges and universities to make sure that broke I'm Eric portfolio\nAs well as our work is very well on line in order to ensure that the uh Minnesota as the talented late and David with all parts of the standing gets economic growth and prosperity\nAnd chancellor ... ban on what would you say are some of the challenges we're hearing from manufacturers across the state\nThe challenge is really very region to region depending upon the composition of industries located in a particular region and the kinds of shortages that off but\nOne thing which comes up diamond again is that right now unemployment is at a very low rate and so the shortages are even more imminent\nAnd so there is some sense of urgency\nOr on the part of the uh businesses that we are ... a line of work quickly so that they need the workforce they want and the second round is\nThat'd be business as also realize that the knowledge content of all occupations is going up just to give you one salient fact Seventy five percent off the gutter\nAnd then they're not getting jobs right now in Minnesota they require some secondary credentials that is some credential from college you're\nAlmost half of them will require a forty year degree and so it is much more you need much greater lead time to train the what going off today than of the study it who could learn on a fly on the job\nChancellor still teams right you have a really close working relationship with a different tack companies across state kind dance I guess transforming your curriculum to prop help me care needs\nYou know it'd be it'd be local businesses are very very complementary of the work going on uh in our colleges and universities and they are very engaged aren't without without colleges and universities are our presidents in colleges and universities\nA regular basis reach out to these businesses but as you know the world around us it's changing very rapidly\nThat that change very rapidly those business needs change very rapidly too and the kind of training needed for the work of\nAll those also considerably over time and so we have to continuously align our portfolio and I work to the needs of a a business partner\nThanks again in my gas Minnesota state colleges and universities chancellor singer Mel hot chocolate he's\nMake Utah shut Minnesota matters will return after the [noise]\n\nYou my friends have connections in the government yeah usa down\nThe officials orders for government information on thousands of dollars and like any good connection there is no only were contained\nWhy one day you're getting a loan from the next thing you know you need a job hunting down the road construction in both have users you for telecommuting ideas of the more the more you use you in\nThe more you you'll find more and\nMore now medications for example\nThey've been known to lead to some interest in travel advisories [noise] our new mobile apps will be even up to you on the go whether\nYou have the information to get more ideas to give your government check out you know a lot of resumes today could lead to retirement when\nConnections there's no way you can\n[noise] looking\nBack to Minnesota matter it was coming week on the U. of M. campus in much of that revolved around athletics former go for basketball star Quincy Lewis was recently named the director of the em club which helps connects former go for a letter winters to the department and then in sports director Mike room sat down with Louis to talk about his new role I'm\nSuper excited you know I'm [noise]\nI'm In the super sweet spot to get to work with two Napoli\nAnd I use I get to work with the alone\nSo I get the help to build up in the with the young guys and I get to a\nBelief in the name what's the alone so um\nI really look at it really simple in my job is that every goal for his goal for because they decided\nThey made the choice to come here and in my role I wanted to see him as a student to be probably the source and then as alone be proud of the choices they made back and I think that's really important and in my new role it was really just getting back to that\nEverything that I Would try to do to try to make our loan proud that they made that decision whenever it was who was Nineteen Seventy three or you know two thousand Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen and the young Gulf or is that a common future if you want to be a goal for and we want to make a profit that decision um because\nWe all know that kids can transfer who's a pig and we want to recruit to have options you know we don't want to be the only school in on the on the sheets so uh it's super\nSuper exciting for me and how important is alumni support for the greater good of the school to have a lumps who want to talk positively about the school might write a check for the school or all that stuff I think is so important I think that you know most of us came here because some\nAlone you know made me look good to us or made it feels good to us and the most important thing is is that the degree that you have on a wall is only valuable wouldn't how the school was doing now are being a basketball player is only as good as the basketball team is now so\nYou're always tied to go first and one of the things that we want to do again is that we want to be proud of it and one of the reasons and one of the things you can do\nAs a loan them is if you care\nAnd the things you can do as a loan miss if you care find a way\nTo be involved find a way to help you know I look at it three ways you can help athletes department by an advocate or by donated [noise]\nDo you want to help student athletes to calm if you're a mentor you can come and helpful for Ford jobs you can help them with internships and then last part is\nYou know what ... go out do fundraising go out and be a part of the community do community service\nAnd you know what if you don't like the way that the border regions and everyone is ... legislating and say hey stop it bill for athletics is important so those are three ways that we're going to be looking at really trying to activate a villain I give them a sense of purpose and say hey look you know what\nAre you still have a purpose does a lot of not come back and help\nEveryone is in the same you don't have to do a true and you know the same way do what's your way but just come back and give off and\nLast one for you because you're a good example of this year very young man from Arkansas all of a sudden you decide to come to Minnesota you have a professional career and where do you choose to a set up shop you're back here in the twin cities representing the ah the em on on that chest and still every now and and I see where in that Letterman's\nJacket [laughter] every once

probably somebody's best [laughter] we have every ... every protein a chicken imagine you know Jay Z and Beyonce come through a you know when you think about\nLike the I laughed because you know being a country boy but if you think about all of the country ah concerts has just come through the twins stadium it's just a great place to\nUh to live and I love the fact that you know you drive about thirty or forty five minutes you know you're out in the middle of the wilderness or men able to\nRelax and have that but also too I think that people are great\nAnd like I said before and I always say is that it's so hard to leave because everyone loves go for sure and I tell the young guys take\nYou come here you work hard you take care of yourself and you do professional development you care

...\nThe Lutheran our bringing Christ to the nation's\nYet as we are in our sinfulness we placed little value in lives that are no longer able to contribute to society or to us more rightly\nSaid it\nWas good could bring a disabled child into this world possibly brain what purpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer or one with a disease that will keep them requiring care for a long time stripping them of their ability\nTo be active citizen even though\nIt was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away\nIt isn't really a life until it fully enters the world we hear today and until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want with it\nWe need not look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are our thoughts may even shock us at times looking at strangers seeing how they are dressed or thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less than our own\nBut what if we are wrong what\nIf our sitting written reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once created in his image\nOh that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold cell value above others in this world should be seen as a sign of sickness you see\nAll were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnants of it and God loves us so much that he wants that all would\nBe saved and if his value for all of us is so great even broken and simple as we are there must be something to each life that he grants to exist and therefore we have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not\nAnd as Christians we cannot be complacent about this issue we cannot claim to see God by his words to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exist today\nPro choice is sitting in God's throne and making decisions that only he should make\nEuthanasia is also the same sure\nThings are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives yeah using evil for good as God does all lives have purpose\nWe may not see it as clouded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils lies but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he\nIs you see God is a servant king\nEach action is one that is meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is and how valued his creation is to be seen\nThinking we know better in seeking control we'd be left looking at an eternity of darkness Jeff and torture in choosing the devil as whom we should follow\nYet wanting none of that God in knowing how we could never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us since his only be gotten son to save us\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded as life for our dead ones ones that deserves nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nTo see how lucky you are you must see how enemies as we are God's still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still\nHold precious value to him all lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own the facts maybe then we can see how his love VIX tends to every one everywhere and that they too are valued and deserved to know of his love also\nThose who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdens are precious in the eyes of God\nThose who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist as lives that we may grow\nIn love by and that is the real gift\nGod grant says to learn of how we too may love and in doing so may receive love and return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with it trials in hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be in closer communion with him trusting as he draws us into deeper understanding of his plan and purpose amidst the chaos\nNow if you are listening and you have gone against that which God wish for you to have\nTaking a life and now find yourself surrounded\nBy the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain I encourage you not to hide in the shadows where the devil wants you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save the center the last the broken\nThe one who's forgiveness knows no limits\nThe sooner the last the broken the one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you a gym in his love\nAmidst darkness storms in trials Jesus Says I Am with you always even to the end of the age and in that there is much to be thankful for\nThe whites giver our lord and savior seeds to give us life eternal in him she wants to share of his love but you would share his love with others also I mean we always think of God's created children how wherever they arrive in this world and wherever\nWe find them in the age of this life has full of value and purposes God declares us to be for the whole children are a heritage from the lord the fruit of the room a reward\nMe we thank the lord always for valuing our wives enough to save them but there was nothing greater to be thankful for today than a father who spared not even the life of his\nSon to save ours and trusting in this most precious work of Christ we will arrive home again to share in a life that never ends\nMade bad piece which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in your lord and savior Jesus Christ in his name we pray all men\n[noise]\nTo learn how you can support wing wide outrage of loose or an hour ministries go to Lucy run our dot org or call one

you begin to resent your author you hate him one day you try something new\nTo protect yourself you start to tell a different tail it goes like this there is no author\nThe universe is a an accident of undecided evolution from\nThe idea of an omnipotent author is a infant tile illusion from an age without smartphones\nI must make my own meaning I must create my own the happy ending I Am the author of my story it's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living\nAnd so it goes you know that when we reject God the problem of justifying life in the face of evil and suffering doesn't go away it gets worse\nAnd now you and I have to bear the God awful burden of justifying ourselves justifying our actions justifying our world or else we pass the buck onto a government and that will become our author and master\nQuestion of justification is on a void of all we cannot find meaning in life unless you receive it as a story and there's no story without an author and so the problem is

haven't been telling you and you need to hear it before it's too late hour author is not limited to one way\nAuthor character relationships are author is not a solitary and moved mover he's not an evil genius playing with us like puppets are avatars he's a father before even started this story from eternity\nThis author has a given take relationship with his son and then the power of his spirit he loves his son and as much as he loves his son this is how much she loves you\nThat's why he created you you know so that you could become not merely a character and his story but he's adopted son his adopted daughter he justified your existence stopped because of what you could do for him but because of what he wants to do for you\nTo bring you into an authentic to weigh relationship\nFather son father daughter relationship of love and trust and to recreate this relationship of love for us the father sent his only son to be born into history to take the name of Jesus to become a character in his own story\nAnd as a character the son suffered all the unanswered questions that you and I suffer as characters in this strange and sometimes confusing story\nJesus showed us what it looks like to actively strive and to passively suffer as God's love children in his death he showed us how to express doubt with job like faith my God my God why have you forsaken\nMe he said father into your hands I commit my spirit Luke twenty three forty six\nIn in his resurrection of Jesus showed us how faith weights on the author of life\nGod is God with us or without us yet God became God for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth\nFace alone was the phrase that the Protestant Reformers used to describe that to a relationship between God the father and his beloved children the reformers were just following the apostle Paul when they insisted that we are justified we are put right with God to face alone\nThis means that we are rescued from our rebellion by hearing in Jesus the voice of our author and taking them at his word trusting him receiving his story is our story that's what it means\nTo be justified by grace along through faith alone in Christ along to the glory of God

as Christ's tells them you have no idea what you're asking for\nExcept that as Christ in St James and John\nWhat they're asking for one involves going through what Christ is going to go through on his

being accused of terrorism unjustly imprisoned having served as a missionary in a Muslim country for decades\nThese sorts of stories do not get enough attention in the media but they're really encouraging to hear servings of Christ in our world from claiming their lord and savior rather than themselves\nIn this fall period of remembrance as we approach the time of the of the Sunday of all

I remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm on the middle of a cornfield or we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we didn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine at one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that\nAnd to think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] something like that and then then all of a sudden those technological advances started and they started to you know kind of multiply in their speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out\nI had to stop that will I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't need 'em [laughter] and now today you know how it is kind of permeated everything so yeah a technology I think is an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin it it also\nBrings questions of of morality and in usage and in how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriate as well Dr Hoffman\nSpeaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world but I'm not someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die really yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a faith of any kind um that's talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that say no this is the right point no this is the right point or my way as and here's the proof or this or whatever it might be I think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and\nAs I could go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town but now every religion every thought every philosophy that exist in the world comes to you and I think for many people\nThat is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um is clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages\nThat are there so on the one hand technology is this great tool for us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents a challenge is with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge or just for people who might not be as as strong in their faith and thought about their faith that might challenge them\nAs well I'm not that we should pull out of technology but I'm understanding\nWho we are in whose we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change\nAnd as much as technology continues to change what remains the same is God's love for us in Jesus Christ and we've reached that message each week you're on the program\nAnd that's kind of beauty I think of Christianity is the goalposts really never move [laughter] you know it's a a Jesus is already kick that ball and and the game has been one [laughter] um\nAnd for us the message is the same the message that because of Jesus Christ\nThat the love of God is here\nFor you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy is not against you he wants you to be with him forever and his kingdom and that comes through\nThe crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and wild things are changing you can never change that that's something that his his historic it's something that happened and it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes the difference\nThen that crucifixion and resurrection we find our identity then as as people of God oh and this is the kind of the beauty of it\nOur identity then as as people have got a and this is the kind of the beauty of it it almost a knowing beauty but it's it's like a beautiful mystery to me are identity being connected\nTo Jesus that in our baptism that death that we talked about that that that saves the world from than\nWe are connected to that death so in our baptism we'd die and we rise with Jesus and our identity is directly connected\nTo the identity of the son of God and so when you worry about who am I a in these changing times uh how do people perceive me on Facebook and all these other a technological platforms the real question that we should be asking is is how does the gods is and God sees us in\nJesus our identity as him\nIn him we have a diet and risen with him and when he looks at as he sees through that death and resurrection of his son and he loves us and he cares for us any for gives us and he wants us to know who he is\nAt the same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously ... and by those who don't Yeah Dr Hoffman talked about that the ah the foolishness of the message that the that is being preached and yet that is the message\nThat contains the power of God for saving us\nYeah it's interesting 'cause we talk about the Christianity is foolishness I'm On the one hand a person could say that and you think well that's a horrible thing to say I'm sure that's not correct but if you ever take time to look at it you know I guess it [laughter] um it's foolishness to our human\nWay of thinking really the why is this person in the world would not have come up with this is a solution to the to the problem is and you know so you think that okay\nSin came into the world and the solution is that God is going to sacrifice his son Jesus and that belief in that\nJesus in in that son of God in his sacrifice is somehow a toning for us that doesn't make\nSense it just doesn't make sense and and so when you try to think about it a cognitively with your mind or academically or treat it like math or science or you know something like that in dissect it in the end you kind of step back from it and go\nWow that is not how I Would have thought about that that's that's not how I Would have done that but in many ways that that again is where the beauty of it is that God's solution\nFor a problem that transcends our ability to cope with it also has to transcend our ability to cope with it so I got I had to provide a solution that was so beyond us that in many ways I just kinda really stand in all\nOf what the gospel is and the ... that he went through and what that meant\nFor Jesus I can only barely begin to kind of crafts but that you know I I read the Bible and I I Try to imagine what would that be like and of course I I Can't put myself in in Jesus you know shoes at that point\nOr you know that he would die and then he would take on the sins of the world and and uh that he would descend into hell in you know for claimed victory things like that\nSo I just have to stand back and I just say uh you know I Believe that but I don't understand it and in many ways when people say that sounds like foolishness I just said yeah you're you're riot but it's not really about understanding it\nFrom a logical perspective for me it's about faith\nAnd faith is a trust and its trusting that the solution God has provided in Jesus crucifixion in his resurrection is sufficient and even though I don't understand it even even though I don't think anyone probably can I trust in it\nMay be another way of saying that same thing is to say that the the cross of Christ is not so much foolishness as it is an offense it's offensive to those who are trying to be right with God on their own terms and it's also an offense to those who think they don't need to be right with God\nYeah I in the passage that was the basis for our tax for it today in many translations it's translated as a stumbling block or a scandal on and that is something that causes one to

comment\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the lose for an hour and we just heard a classic message from Dr Oswald Hoffman\nTalking about the connection between faith and fear joining me here now to discuss that is Dr Tony cook director of us ministries here at Luther and our ministries Tony let's talk about fear in our lives and uh how face interact in intersects with that\nSure ah thanks for having me again this is a topic that\nI can get in the way back machine and go back who um I think if I'm remembering correctly too about when I was seven and and um I was going through some rough times uh in my life\nAnd I started to have\nNight terrors ... when I Would have these dreams that felt like you were kind of locked into them you know you couldn't get out um they repeated every single night it was the same dream\nThat that happened every time and when I Would uh when I Would wake up from his dream I'd be like really startled and in in my heart would be racing and I'd be half awake and half asleep and I would see\nThe shadows in the room is a little kid you know and that's scary stuff it was that I had a closet that didn't have a door so dark um and I had a a Barney rebel nightly news though yeah in fact I had a night light\nAnd that was the only light in the room and sometimes it help and sometimes it cast odd you know shadows on the wall but\nWhat happened is I was going through this period of when you went to sleep I have this dream and I would wake up with this tremendous sense of fear and for boating and I I'm a little kid I thought what can I Do\nTo keep these things and um I really only knew two prayers at that time I knew now I lay me down to sleep\nAnd I knew the Lord's Prayer and so what I did is um before I Would go to sleep I Would close my eyes and in my mind every time I said one of those two prayers they would make a brick\nAnd I would\nTake these bricks and I would put them around me in a circle and as I pray that they would get higher and higher and higher until it was like a pillar you know ... and I was inside of this pillar of brick of prayer and that would help me fall asleep and it gave me a sense that this this pillar of bricks was\nProtecting me if you will from the fears that came in the night and eventually eventually they they went away after a period of time but I still have that very very vivid sense of\nNeeding to be protected from that fear as well as not being able to stop those fears from you know in invading my sleep but I Do remember that little I don't see a childish technique because now that I think about it ... it probably wasn't that bad that bad of a thing to do but uh that was a time in my life that\nI had these kind of foreboding fears and and how I handled it as you look back on that as an adult\nDo you continue to use prayer as a shield and as a protector yeah for me it's interesting with the prayer it as a as a Lutheran\nA lot of times we'll say a when something happens will pray for you mhm and a and a lot of times that's a a a way of saying I'm Sorry for what you're going through or whatever [laughter] um but what I realize that prayer has\nPower and and the power of prayer is something that I've learned over my life and I still use it today I'm when I'm fearful and anxious anxiety about decisions I Need to make things like that most of the time still oddly enough I I use prayer\nWhen I go to sleep I'm a person that thinks a lot in their head and turning off", "show_name": "Christian Crusaders", "year": "2018", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "14", "locations":
