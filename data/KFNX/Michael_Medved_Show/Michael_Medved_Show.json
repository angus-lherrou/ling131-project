buying a home is one of the largest purchases they'll ever make what risk you have when you buy a home for one you ever ask a market value lost many people are in that in two thousand eight right\nMany people thought that there was no significant risk from your home and going down in value but that perception is now changed forever what about risk of property loss flood fire earthquake when storm or theft those are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment\nOther properties you might only have the same risks if you own a car a boat airplane or any other property was significant value there is a risk of loss when you own something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you know the obvious answer here you get insurance on those assets right the church costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they'll probably never use so why would you buy insurance on your home\nYou might say well I have a loan on my house so I have to buy insurance on it so that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for what'd you still buy insurance on your home I bet you would but why\nWhether you realize it or not\nYou'd buy insurance on your home because of something called a catastrophic risk\nCatastrophic risk means that you have any chance even if it's a small chance to lose a lot of value in other words you can lose a lot of money if something bad happens\nThe reason we buy insurance on our home is because the cost of insurance is very small compared to the last we might incur if a catastrophic event happens\nJust for the fun of it let's assume you\nLive in a modern home it's up to current building codes you don't smoke and fall asleep in your bed you don't light candles and leave them on attended and you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the catch it\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the loss\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list there's this when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero and the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes me forty three percent gain just to get back to zero\nHere's another question when did negative thirty equals zero and the answer\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out\nOn top of the loss that's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list is is is when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero\nThen the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes a forty three percent again just to get back to zero\nHere's another question when does negative thirty equals zero and the answer is one year my client that's because my clients have no possibility of market losses\nSo you never have to worry about trying to regain those losses also upfront bonuses of up to ten percent when you begin your account they guaranteed lifetime income account that contractually

higher return with red money we accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater games\nRead money is always exposed to the upside and downside of market risk\nGreen money on the other hand is about safety and security when green money were not willing to accept the risk of losses showed this money typically we're willing to accept a lower return in exchange for safety and security\nGreen money does not have downsides market risk so Fred money is exposed upside and downside market risk angry money has only upside market potential which ones better\nWell that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad\nIt all depends on your situation the very important question we should ask ourselves or these what percentage of

the definition of insanity as going to Albert Einstein is doing the same thing\nOver and over again expecting different results from the moment you started investing you're probably fresh out of high school or college I'm sure it became very apparent to you that the market goes up and the market goes down\nYou've seen it over and over again that every few years the market crashes and sometimes it crashes hard\nFor most of your life you didn't really care in fact if you're like me I wanted the market crash back in my younger years why because it was a buying opportunity besides I knew the market would recover and I was young enough that I wasn't going to be using the money anytime soon anyway\nThings are different now closer I get to retirement the last cavalier I get towards my retirement money the more I realized that I have very little or no time to recover from a major market correction Mark Twain once said I'm not so interested in return on my money as the return of my money\nFresh out of high school or college I'm sure it became very apparent to you that the market goes up and the market goes down\nYou've seen it over and over again that every few years the market

opportunity besides I knew the market would recover and I was young enough that I wasn't going to be using it in the money anytime soon anyway\nThings are different now closer I get to retirement the last cavalier I get towards my retirement money the more I realized that I have very little or no time to recover from a major market correction\nMark Twain once said I'm not so interested in return on my money as the return of my money this cold is this true today as it was when he sat at corruption uncertainty and the ups and downs of the market they haven't gone away are you interested more in the return of your money\nWhat if we could do more than that\nGive us a call at eight four four three seven one safe that's eight four four three seven one seven to three three we have a free save

other financial shows or the other brokers out there I Know it is because we keep you from doing something and saying with the retirement\nRemember the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results the truth is that nothing's changed your portfolio is at risk when you were twenty five years old just as much as it's at risk today\nSo what's the difference the difference is your age your time period for recovery\nWhat makes putting your retirement money in the stock market bonds variable annuities are any variable investment crazy is that you're doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results the results aren't going to be different\nYour investments will go up and your investments will crash\nWhat's different

crazy have you heard of something called a financial illustration you probably had and just maybe don't know it\nWhen you go and you see a financial planner\nThat it's in the business of risking your money they might use their computer software to run examples of what could happen to your money sometimes these examples are based on historical data and sometimes they're flat out just as Derek all\nI had a client the other day that showed me an illustration from their broker that demonstrate a what would happen to their money if it continued to grow over the next ten years at twelve percent compound a growth can you believe that ... percent compound to grow up where do financial planners get the nerve to even print that on paper\nWhat's even crazier is I've never seen an illustration from one of these brokers that shows what happens to clients' money if they wake up one day and fifty percent of their money is gone now why not\nCouldn't that happened you bet it could and in fact so I'm here today might be in that very situation it's so easy for financial salespeople the show you the best possible results and then just to be fair show you may be some moderate losses on these illustrations\nI think every financial professional should be required to show their prospective clients what the worst results were from the clients they manage let me ask you if you were thinking about working with a financial planner and you found out that the last fifty percent of their clients retirement funds would you want to work with them\nWell now that I brought it up you're probably

them\nAnd let us know if you're interested in how you can get up to seven percent compounded annual return for up to Twenty years in a lifetime income account would that account you can be guaranteed an income that you can never outlive\nUs to talk about why no market strategies are so important and why should not expose your retirement to the risk of the market\nJust reminds me of something you know here in the value of the sun we have all these beautiful hiking trails around in some can get pretty rocky and steep the other day I was watching some kids climb up on a tall rock had a steep face\nAnd they got up to the top they weren't even worried about falling they had no thought of how they were going to get down there was just no apparent concern for potential bodily harm\nAs I watch them it dawned on me how risking their bodily health\nBecause they were young they had no concern and it's very similar to risky money in retirement they both have consequences for example when we're young we have no problem going up those hills in rocks slipping in sliding then coming back down as little thoughts of danger consequences\nAnd along the way getting some bumps and bruises it's just easier to heal up from it when you're young\nOnce you get older though we may still go hiking but it's probably with a bit more cautious and\nThe reason for this simple as we get older the ability for our bodies to absorb physical punishment it's decreased and the time it takes to recover it increased if you think about it the same is true for our money\nWhen we're young we can absorb the bumps or bruises you can absorb the huge losses any retirement money you know because of the time period available to recover was much longer however when you're in retirement or close to retirement\nThere's little to no time to recover from those losses\nThe no marketing strategies I work with allow you to see the beauty without the danger you can still get to participate in the fun without any of the

strategy that allows you to build up an income account the compounds that up to seven percent per year this account can be used to guarantee you that you'll never outlive your retirement money you see when you suffer a loss in the market\nEven if it's a small loss you have three problems the lost value is just one problem the second problem is the time it takes to make back that loss\nBut the third problem is is it's almost impossible for you to regained your losses let me explain if you have a market exposed account of a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd the market drops by thirty percent your account has dropped to Seventy thousand very painful right\nBut that's just the beginning imagine the markets go back up the following year by thirty percent do you think you're back to your original hundred thousand the real answer is absolutely not now why not it's the cruel math of losses\nHere's why after dropping thirty percent the account is at Seventy thousand\nSo the thirty percent gain in the following year on the way back up his gain on only Seventy thousand thirty percent of Seventy thousand there's only Twenty one thousand and when you add the Twenty one to the Seventy that's left over it's only Ninety One thousand\nSo the real math is that it would take a forty three percent gain just to get back to where we started which was a hundred thousand\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the loss\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list there's this windows negative thirty plus forty three equals zero and the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes eight forty three percent again just to get back to zero\nSo the real math is that it would take a forty three percent gain just to get back to where we started which was a hundred thousand\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the law\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list is is is when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero and the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes me forty three percent again just to get back to zero", "show_name":
