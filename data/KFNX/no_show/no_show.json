power bill has gone up significantly dramatically and it's going to continue to go up significantly and dramatically and if I can help her pay this bill now\nAnd she can't have this bill we need to find a solution and I knew nothing about solar I didn't know how it worked I didn't know how much it cost and I wrote my sleeves up and I looked into it and it made sense produce sure on power and pay less for it\nAnd if somebody's trying to sell your battery talk to me before you do because people don't understand better either not rate what they can do what you want them to do but the electric

see about us and similarly the Bible sets forth an impressive a ray of events which were to take place in the earth following the return of the divine Christ\nIf we can see the beginning of some of these events it is logical to conclude that the parents here or presents a price but even now be a reality\nKind of Bible student now see any of these signs or events taking place and Jessie can\nAs a matter of fact there are a number of prophecies of his return which is the most spectacular to me certainly nothing similar to these prophecies describe what has yet taken place around us\nDon't be too sure us so much pictorial language is used in the prophecies of Christ returning second presence\nThat is true of the prophetic shout and trumpet blowing these expressions are pictorial of things which would occur during the early years of his presence there shout is one of encourage incitement which already has stirred up the downtrodden people and nations of earth started them on the march looking for freedom\nBy Jesus said that his presence would be as a lightning which would reach from east to west and to come to think of at that may describe the bright shining of the sun reaching from east to West is that what Jesus meant\nYes it is his presence will I should a new day for mankind\nIt will be like the sun in the sense that the enlightening influences of Christ through the agencies have his kingdom will be worldwide from east to west but not until the work of his kingdom is complete at the end of the thousand years\nWill the world be fully in life so Jesus explained

reach from east to west and to come to think of that that may describe the bright shining of the sun reaching from east to West is that what Jesus meant\nYes it is his presence will I wrote a new day for mankind\nIt will be like the sun in the sense that the enlightening influences of Christ through the agencies have his kingdom will be worldwide from east to west but not until the work of his kingdom is complete at the end of the thousand years\nWell the world be fully in life so Jesus explained that the people will know of his second presence but it will all but the result in the late ... and blessing of the whole world\nAbout and that you haven't said much so far about how Christ is president has a fee for the night I'd like you to pick that thought\nWell Jesus himself said that he would come as a fee\nBut his watching disciples has earned the very early signs of his presence and therefore the first wants to know about it the prophecies reveal that there would be a considerable periods in the beginning of his parents see our presence but only his faithful followers would know about it\nThat the world in general would not know Paul said something of the day of Christ presidents that one day she'll say peace and safety then sudden destruction come up on them as Dr veil up on a woman with child and they they should not escape\nThat suggests I presume spasms of destructive tropical such as the world has experienced relate during my generation I think that we could say that\nThe trouble from the first World War on has come as Dr veil upon a woman with child\nIndeed Russell if you notice it carefully we'll see that it has been in in increments towards bathrooms or periods of trouble and that's why I said a few moments ago that only as we see the events of our day as signs of Christ second presidents can we understand the true significance\nAnd remember this soon and Russell very soon\nThe distraught in Fairfield people of earth will be

then renting\nAbsolutely ... so you know um\n[noise] these are your rents there is a I saw it and I think it's called rent monkey just today that the average rent America ... county is going up ten percent a year\nSo every time he leaves me news so at ten percent of an average rent is a hundred and fifty dollars so your rent is going up a hundred and fifty dollars every month every time you Reno your yearly so after five years you know you're at a seven hundred and fifty dollars more than you paid when you started your lease\nAnd when you purchase a home your mortgage is going to go up a little bit 'cause your taxes are going to just every year but it's going to go up ten or Fifteen or twenty dollars or you know a month maybe as compared to a hundred and fifty dollars a month with your rent you know you're just you're paying somebody else's mortgage for them you're paying somebody else's investment for them you need to pay for yourself\nRight and it seems to me that people really should take a look at what that situation is calling because so many people out there I Know many people would just say oh I can never get buy a house because I'm sure I don't have the credit but you're here they can they can turn it around let's talk about that program again so they can hear it\nSo there's there's a couple of different programs but the benefits are are include a having credit as low as six twenty to purchase a home a lot of people think it has to be you know higher than six sixty or six Seventy or you know seven hundred or whatever\nSix twenty which is pretty low credits to be able to buy a home there's programs with no mortgage insurance I we didn't talk about mortgage insurance but this is a little\nFee that you have to pay in your monthly mortgage payment unless you put twenty percent down\nThese programs have no mortgage insurance with no downpayment wow yeah go ahead so uh you know and we were talking about the benefits of um uh owning versus renting and moving costs so um when you move into a ... little rental what you are\n[laughter] you have um you know your first month's rent you have your security deposit you have a clean deposit if you have pets you have large deposits you know that could be as much as three or four thousand dollars may not back either you know you're not right so and and I can get you into these programs for less than a

beings on this planet that we have more rights than we are\nLed to believe and most of us are afraid to get in trouble we're afraid for for something to happen or bad to happen to us and so we stay

ourselves in the hour we're going to heal our nation and our world\nUm things are really great happy to be here today I'm just outside of\nCalgary, Canada in oak talks little community called oak

the lower\nLower frequency there's a lot of despair and physical pain in it there's a lot of people who are depressed I'm lots of illness sadness financial desperation\nAnd then you know you move up a bit and you have people that have moments of happiness and periods of joy but they're always expecting something terrible to happen and so a lot of conditioning and those two lower levels you know a lot of belief systems that are holding them back from moving forward\nAnd then I was looking around and I saw these people are just like really happy and their relationships for healthy and um they

kicking off your shoes and walking barefoot on dirt and grass no we often hear about are things mental health benefits since being nature is a proven way to boost your mood and lower stress\nBut I Know that the you know why he said earth thing cannot to improve our looks and slow aging\nThe idea behind er thing is that if you take your socks and your shoes off and you walk actually in the dirt you can absorb electrons from the earth now why this is important is because\nThe idea of oxidation and so our bodies all day are are bombarded with free radicals free radicals are damaged molecules that are trying to steal an electron from your healthy molecules and you're healthy cells\nAnd the reason why we recommend let's say putting vitamin C. on your skin and eating colorful fruits and vegetables is because you are then adjusting anti accidents\nOr anti opposite donate electrons to neutralize free radicals and that's why these types of foods and these ... are great for your skin they're great for your uh anti aging\nSo the idea that behind her thing that you can absorb electrons from the earth\nIs that you are now then absorbing these electrons and those electrons can act to once again neutralize free radicals so similar to putting vitamin C. serum on your skin or eating colorful fruits and vegetables or drinking red wine you can get a similar effect by absorbing those electrons from the earth and doing it that way\nYou were held these are top priority intelligence for your house [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is intelligence for your health radio\nYou are

we've been spending a lot of time talking about the bomber and that sort of thing and I wanted to grab you on a couple of those things at the end of this interview but would you mind talking about the fact that we see continued that bridge to try to ban plastic here and banned plastic there\nAnd the fact is I thought plastics has actually been one of the things we had done that actually made our lives we take it for granted but it's made our lives a whole lot safer from a lot of the threads that human beings have faced literally for thousands of years and plastic as the way we've escape from some of those threats\nOh absolutely and in fact uh as I wrote this article about it go fundamentalists attacks on plastics\nOr I thought back to the Nineteen sixty seven film the graduate uh and you

I thought back to the Nineteen sixty seven film the graduate or and you may remember that uh Dustin Hoffman plays the title role and he said his graduation party and the guy comes up to him and says uh then I have one word\nFor you time or it as a and a half century since then plastics have really revolutionized are so many industries uh\nAnd uh you know when I was training and and medicine we had just converted from glass bottles for intravenous solutions and blood to plastic bottles and it was such a remarkable improvement they store better they keep better\nThey're safer because inevitably glass bottles which would be dropped a and the ... the glass on the floor and you would you would never get up\nAnd people would get caught and and\nSo on a but medical\nDevices or electronics all sorts of things\nUh plastics had been really a revolution and yet the activists continue to attack it a Earth Day in April of this year was a devoted to ending plastic pollution quote unquote and um\nWe continue to have a attacks on various plastic ... things that make plastics pliable and and more convenient or like this ... a BPA\nUm and the attacks just go on and on and on a a base with without much basis um and uh without\nThinking about it carefully and considering the science\nWell and I thought about that too because I Know a lot of people say well you know there's food safety\nBut I buy my food in tin cans when a lot of people may not appreciate is those so called tin cans with ... which have very little ten in them are actually lined with as you said BPA and other kinds of things that make\nA tin can a whole lot more safe for containing any kind of food you buy the grocery store and and and and the plastics\nYou know dog I think about the plastics where products you know including a lot of food products are package sometimes hermetically sealed and you know the air and taken out or some other kind of gas put in so that so that everything last longer and worries or is better and better protected\nAgainst the kind of common contamination they could literally take your life or a few decades ago\nYou're you're absolutely right and you you bring up a of\nA broader point which is that you have to you have to do with the risk analysis folks called comparative risk assessment\nYou have to ask if you if you will lemonade a product day what are you a substitute for what are you left with a and so we're seeing that in California because there's a a a\nState senator who keeps introducing bills to ban Styrofoam containers from restaurants\nFor

and because it both inflated and kept the juice where I Belong and they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill and when I went on research in a long time ago I had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coated paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last\nDan Styrofoam containers from restaurants\nFor takeout

thing is that a ... a generates less waste water and also occupies less space in the landfill\nAnd the other thing is that we have we now have\nBacteria that will degrade\nA Styrofoam and and other plastics in the landfill so you know ... is that these objections these attempts to band things or just not well founded and well thought out so which is typical of what we say about the anti corporate anti technology a pickle fundamentalist\nPay I Want to ask you about something else because about about an hour ago I was talking to a guest a who's a former police detective we were talking about the bomber you know the bombs that went through the males and he said well what he ... he thought it was interesting that we found out he's a he was a ... a retired top investigator for New York city's police department and he said we found out the postal service\nHas things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about other kinds of contraband whether it's illegal drugs from Asia\nOr we're seeing a stuff come through that's that's a marijuana get shipped that way and if states haven't decided to legalize it it shouldn't be ship\nAnd I asked him we had this technology we see at the airport and I you know while I don't know all the particulars of it I Know that when they watch your bag with computers and cell phones and this and batteries and all that goes through\nThey know what color the screen is supposed to be and they know what colors indicate it may be some kind of contraband whether it's a fluid that liquid or possibly explosive\nYou know I don't know what color explosive comes up as 'cause I Would imagine I haven't been through the TSA line when somebody whose putting explosives through but my understanding is the color coding helps them spot those things pull him aside and do some more examination I said if you wanted to scan hundreds of thousands of uh packages the postal service carried\nCould we do that and could we say to a computer\nWhen a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray you know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that may or may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside\nAnd and let somebody else take a closer look at it that's all the technology that did within our grasp isn't it\nIt it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... and red flag and pass a law uh in fact it's my understanding that\nChecked baggage is a analyze that way as well as the the the baggage that you put put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like\nWhen a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray you know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that may or may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside\nAnd and let somebody else take a closer look at it that's all the technology to ditch within our grasp isn't it\nIt is and with artificial intelligence or this system can actually learn what it needs to reach in red slide pass all are in fact it's my understanding that\nChecked baggage is a analyze that way as well as the baggage that you put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strangers doing the job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that the stuff that's going through the post office gets scanned by that same kind of thing I think the public would be all for it\nYeah I think we could certainly do that for packages or you know flat flat letters or probably sail through may be doing chess for packages that's very good idea laws\nWell I just it just struck me that if that's within our grasp but I'm the same guy who wants to see a chicken irradiated before it gets into the supermarket so we can kill all the salmonella or the other bacteria or eco allied that's on the exterior of it is it isn't a cure all but it was her take a ... a lot of the contamination and probably\nPeople freak out and and and unfortunately with bears a you know that panic attack is often what will trigger the bears to act aggressively\nHere Joe I thought you were keeping most of the nuts in Virginia up and the purple part of the state around Richmond is don't you try to keep them confined up there\nWill you try to at least get them elected to office and then they can do crazy things like you know go back in the valley in on a board member from a jails to try to get you know our catcher in the middle east program

called terrorist threats\nI wanted to drill down on that for a long time people understand what that really involved\nTerrorist threats under the law means that you are threatening to commit an act of violence against an individual or physical property and it also can include threats designed to influence a branch of government\nOr politics so I'm going to be paying close attention to that and said

R.\nAll ...\nAnd this is out of the daily mail but again I'm not reporting back to the says I'm reporting on the daily mail Caesar\n\nAll tear say Iraq was taken into custody on friday morning in\nPlantation Florida in connection with the bombs the suspect is they mailed bombing spree targeting critics of president Donald Trump a male bombing spray\nIt was not a bomb\nI'm going to say that again we guys give me a wide shot here in Studio ... that is a bronze re creation of a famous statue of the battle but was it deliberately\n... and going from memory teleprompter three or ... lost the

soldier we understand from three thousand years ago I Know you know that\nBut I'm trying to explain the Democrats and CNN everybody else that we don't buy your hoax that these fake bombs were real bombs and I don't buy any of the rest of your story I mean you've got this guy they're calling a white male\n\nAnd showed that pitcher to a thousand people that I Would say he looks Hispanic or Native American which is fine I'm not trying to blame some group on race here I Am saying none of this adds up the van looks fake\nThe timing the fact that the media hypes it can be all this violence against Democrats and it's kind of it's coming into Trump's fault the Dow Jones fault it's a free press this fall\nThen fake bombs get mailed out\nHis van looks like something out of central casting\nAnd now this happens they're calling him a white male and I I guess you could identify as white\nAnd now we've got photos I've been coming out at blacks for Trump and other rallies\nI don't think we know

was\nA back rented a pleasure to have you with us\nA very good morning to you guys are yeah October has flown by and welcome back to you got to ah\nYou talked to find a river and what am I in my mind are focused on leaky got repair which we knew was a a real critical issue the physicians were screaming saying look we've got to take care of candy they're parasites and ... and you have to help us with\nTight junction are and the um the soft tissue\nThat makes up the digestive tract because this is the precursor to this is the first domino to fall\nIf we end up do you talk to find a live a wonderful but if you if the guy is still in a a terrible a quantum leap a somewhat the these are condition and this is just that uh we're never going to really have long term results are and so that was the reason that we added candy at a complex and Sarah packed tasted a lot for put about health and\nThen we ended up coming along with the leak got repair for individuals who are you know had the chronic is individuals who have also is um ... or ... you know those individuals severe cases\nLook we can get rid of the or at least I could try to control the candy to population and the parasites and so forth but if it leaves behind all damage a skin a tissue layer or in the digestive tract people are going out and there are vying for voucher thing no that's healthy and it is\nA and the one thing that I say when I'm In front of a a crowd of people that are interested in and sort of correcting a lot of health issues when it comes to the guy is look you have to rebuild that got lining otherwise provided accept no interest in staying\nIt's sort of you know your rent ending new applicants into an apartment building where all the the windows were broken out there's no appliances you have to rebuild thing [noise]\nYou know had the chronic is individuals who have also has um ... or ... you know those individuals severe cases\nLook we can get rid of the or at least I could try to

windows were broken out there's no appliances you have to rebuild saying\nHey I'm Brenda in a family member just got a diagnosis fatty liver\nAnd I'm I'm Wondering what can you take off with your pet 'em in and tell everyone uh the consequences of not taking care of that fatty liver and also how many people in our country or a on average have fatty liver and can you tell us more about how how pads on may help that situation\nYeah thank you it's great question a lot of scope questions here so to gain a little bit of perspective\nAbout one in three people or have ... or so it\nMay not be diagnosed but are in the category of fatty liver and if we look at the spectrum it goes from a fatty liver to massive fibrosis to sort of roses to you don't want to be in that category so uh\nYou want to soon as you get to the stage uh and it's when you get to the point where you're about five to eight percent concentration of fat cells within the liver you're in that ... river category\nAnd had you know uh whether or not you have fatty liver very tough Patel because we don't have nerve endings down there you're not going to get ... where you are going to get some digestive issues and you are going to have trouble regulating glucose cycle you're fasting blood glucose will be hire\nA than a if you had a healthy or liver\nUm there are some other science but those are typically the what the ones that stand out to a third of folks are in that category fifty percent of people over the age of ... um this is a big time trend so forty years ago this uh with about twenty five percent of the uh fatty liver population\nUm was a individuals who are who are getting it from not from alcohol but from other sources now it's completely flipped so we know it's coming from food\nYou can't really get around that if you go out to a restaurant you're probably not getting organic foods I write so\nThese are the issues that we're grappling with and when you take in things like GMOs you know they contain ... for the life of snake pits the digestive track then runs into the liver and then it sort of stops the grind the whole phase one conjugation a phase one\nOr some ... called subtraction face I mean that it also complicate face\nTo conjugation said and both of those are important when you're talking about the ... I\nI wanted to do the mission Brennan that a lot of people don't realize they eat the same foods day after day after day developed to chip in cheese and when this happens the membrane horrors and the gap membrane become a large and as that happens the conscience inside of our GI track\nA leak into our system the circulation\nThat's just off a whole cascade of events or which we call the ige easy for special immune cells that attacking attach themselves to the unwanted or a conscience of getting to the systemic circulation ring the bell Mike through to a lab right on them\nThe whole phase one conjugation a phase one\nA so called subtraction fade I find that it also complicate face\nTo conjugation ... and both of those are important when you're talking about the carpet I\nI wanted to do the mission Brennan that a lot of people don't realize they eat the same foods day after day after day developed to chip in cheese and when this happens the membrane horrors and the gap membrane become a large and as that happens the conscience inside of our GI track\nA leak into our systemic circulation\nThat's just off a whole cascade of events or which we call the ige easy for special immune cells that attacking attach themselves to the unwanted or a conscience of getting to the systemic circulation print them out\nOf my lab right on them because we can repair address this issue and it gets into a very very uh a human face that most people have no clue about how well this product work\nYeah and I'm a little surprised by my my breath rate in this industry too because I Know this is a major should be a major focus of of our industry and yet I I don't know if there's the formulation that sort of addresses all these issues that I think a critical for the healing process\nSo you know we have the zinc in there that's to a address are all sort of repair episode or regeneration college and synthesis very critical very helpful for folks who have a silly act writes a clue to me but for inflammation uh increased costs will secretion\nWe have the organic slippery alum and the marshmallow route\nThat is sort of a to create\nAlmost a synthetic if you can think of it that way although it is natural a protective mucosal secretion\nI in place or the cause of secretion that you yourself will secrete only when you have healthy for yourselves which when you have got\nIs not always the case um we have licorice route again to address ulcers Hartford inflammation we have ... that is also to quell auto immune issues and information it stabilizes the ...\nSo that they released a lot less histamine at the site of the ah got lining\nOr any jeep there are again it's a a episode we'll sell 'em regeneration ... college in ... synthesis but also helps to stimulate your own your costs will secretion so when you combine all of these things together\nI end up formulation you have a tissue regeneration increased me coastal secretion anti inflammatory tight junction were very protective coating that really that's the those that combination of those ingredients help people repair and regenerate and get away from\nAh the constant leaking or as you said into the circulatory system works stimulate your immune system a lot of folks come back to the uh and they say look uh I don't have digestive issues the heartburn has gone away the interesting thing is I can sleep better\nAnd yeah so I all of these things you know and and that may be a as a result it a lot of the neurotransmitters um that help us to sleep a they're created and the guy so when we talk about you know they got being the second brain or that Vegas nerve\nIs Ninety percent transmitting or information from the guts to the brain not the other way around ten percent of the brain to the guy oh if you're having yeah if you're having sleep is your\nUm this may also be something that you might want to focus on we got repair overall\nHave Brandon a compliance with our uh people that come in and buy these types of products what can you tell us about the proper way to really take at least you got for the best\nA lot of folks come back to the uh and they say look uh I don't have digestive issues the heartburn has gone away the and the interesting thing is I can sleep better\nAnd yeah so uh all of these things you know and and that may be a as a result it a lot of the neurotransmitters um that help us to sleep a they're created and the guy so when we talk about you know the guts being the second brain or that Vegas nerve\nIs Ninety percent transmitting a information from the get to the brain not the other way around ten percent from the brain to the got well if you're having yeah if you're having sleep issues\nUm this may also be something that you might want to focus on we got repair overall\nThey Brendan a compliance with our uh people that come in and buy these types of products what can you tell us about the proper way to really take at least you got for the best effect\nYeah a great question and I and I think I like to recommend that folks take this I'm On a a relatively empty stomach\nA and a typically when you know you're not going to be eating anything for a good period of time to a lot of folks that take leaving got repair they're taking it at night uh you know a good hour hour and a half after they've had their last meal or so the coating can\nAh really reside or on the digestive track for preventing and creating a barrier between all the things that the women at the just the track that typically stimulate the immune to a because when your immune system engages\nIt's shooting everywhere and you're going to get a lot of friendly fire so when you put it in their ah and it's got a lot of time to sit there and I'm a create a repair environment that's sort of ideal and we get individual who are highly reactive ... everything\nAnd those people sometimes take the product before they eat a and that probably has to do with again the anti inflammatory and to a certain extent the code and\nUh and that helps them digest saying uh without paying\nRent and how long should we take this product at least you got repair how long should we take it and should we take a break after Ninety Days or will we ever get rid of our ... she got\nYeah wow that's a and that really is a question that comes down and yeah that's it [laughter] that comes out to the individual what does your diet look like now what did your diet looked like before and what's the sense of the damage\nAnd how much or is your immune system engaged in creating a problem and to the to the extent that we were talking about before with can't data and parasites what other organizations are in there that are continuously aggravating that situation\nSo uh when somebody comes to what typically a and complains of of pain\nThey will start taking leaky got repair and they typically report back within a day or two the pain have gone away or at the very least received a dramatic like that's the good side um\nHow much you should take and how long we have individuals that take just one or two a day and they're perfectly fine after a month\nReceded dramatically that's a good side um\nHow much you've taken how long we have individuals that take just one or two a day and they're perfectly fine after a month\nAbsolutely so if you have been on an antibiotic like you said it's just so so important that you take probiotics especially during that time yeah because like you said you do kill off all that bacteria\nThat's really important to re hydrate replenish that got and so in this case I Would suggest for you the urgent care which is that a hundred billion again it's the solar a micro biome that we are talking about and specific that when you come in and you'll see the urgent care as that specific one that would be perfect\nAnd if you're wondering like well when do I take it just didn't actually on the box says two hours after the antibiotic to take the antibiotic you wait two hours minimum I Would say and then you can go ahead and take that probiotics can re cultivate and read you know recalling nights the got\nReal good real good now how long do I have to be on this\nOh well that's a question so if you're on antibiotics you know it's so hard to say because antibiotics you killed so much of your got to really I mean I Would always recommend a minimum of thirty days which is actually in this case it thirty ... per the bottle but easily you could I mean a ... is a central you know you could take this\nEvery day just like you would take your multi so it's really important but if you've been on the the antibiotic I Would definitely suggests at least the whole package of the urgent to really help sort of free strengthen the God\nWill that's real good now I notice too in one of your great formula here you have a weight formula can you tell me a little bit about that one\nAnd I think that this one come January to will be a\nReally really popular one because not only are you getting of course you're probiotics which are great for your digestive health your immune system but the way formula is actually designed to do a lot of different things and so when we think about weight issues a lot of the time we talk about blood sugar right help our blood sugars off were either hungry or not hungry and everything we're going to be thrown off so the cool thing about\nThis one is it does have strains that will actually help regulate your blood sugar will help curb and\nUh basically Kirby appetite but also help you know ... um [noise]\nBasically balance the appetite I should say in general so whether you're trying to lose weight I guess I'm trying to say or maybe gain weight having the balance of your appetite is really important for your way in general so there's a lot of cool things that it will help with the weight in specific okay cool and now that one I can take like a month after month after month correct absolutely\nJust I mean really most of these you could take all the time if you wanted to but of course like things we ... we have with the urgent right that's usually more specific for like an antibiotic or if you're really trying to boost your immune system so like the wintertime you value family coming in with all that's going on it's okay to take the urgent even if you didn't take an antibiotic because we're really help boost\nRight how far blood sugars off were either Hungary or not hungry and everything we're going to be thrown off so the cool thing about this one is it does have strains that will actually help regulate your blood sugar will help curb a physically hurt the apple type but also help you know ... um [noise]\nBasically balance the appetite I should say in general so whether you're trying to lose weight I guess I'm trying to say or maybe gain weight having the balance of your appetite is really important for your way in general so there's a lot of cool things that it will help with the weight in specific okay cool and now that one I can take like a month after month after month correct\nAbsolutely just I mean really most of these you could take all the time if you wanted to but of course like things we've had we've had with the urgent\nRight that's usually more specific for like an antibiotic or if you're really trying to the gym and since I'm so like the wintertime you value family coming and we put all this going on it's okay to take the urgent even if you didn't take an antibiotic because we're really help boost the immune system\nSince we know the eighty percent of our immune system is actually in our gut\nRight and it's all starts in the gut right\nTheory absolutely I tell you about your guts are transmits a signal to your brain so\nThey're not the other way around so much but hey for more information go solar ray dot com so L. A. R. A. Y. dot com also these products are right here at ... in our refrigerated case come in the store were six zero to nine or seventh street come in and ask for solar ray\nWe're going to be talking about more of these products here about the my question is a few years ago we only had one or two probiotics on the show we had maybe six billion or a billion\nNow we have a robotic formula for many different parts of your body a sex men women or you know even have a urgent care if you're taking antibiotics\nSo the key to what can you shed light on why all the manufacturers are jumping on the bandwagon to pick a certain part of your body to help can you tell us more\nYeah one of the things I Want to mention to a probiotic is we are ten times more bacteria than we are human cells\nSo if you think about that it's kind of creepy but we're walking bacteria right I Know it's gross and some hand sanitizer no actually just getting going on um but in this case since we are so much like your it's everywhere in our guts in our ears it's in our nose it is the main part of our body in the way that just as much as we need water we need bacteria\nAnd so without being said since that bacteria is everywhere we could have something that would be cool and specific right we could have something that would be your weight specific the urgent response because there's so many different strains in the body\nAnd there's so many different things are these different formulas that are going to help with different issue that people might be having in fact most of our issued some from our got anyway right if if I got off we're going to be off in one way shape\nOr form right 'cause it all starts in the guts really does so and now it's going to also ask you to a little bit more about the product um tell me about the interior coated\nHolding that you've got on there yeah absolutely so I'm sort of giving you a little idea of what ... means OK I'm genes anybody seeing it in order for a probiotic\nTo have the word and hear it on the front of the package and it has to last a minimum of sixty minutes within the body okay because I think from consumption to actually get to the small intestine it take sixty minutes to get there and so within its guaranteeing that this probiotic\nIt's going to get the small intestine and a fully intact all the way through so that's a little idea of the word in ... and in this case with a micro biome actually this particular collection we've made it in the chair shield\nFor the old technology would coated\nBut the new technology is the shield and the field is basically a pine fiber\nWith pine fat and those together are so strong that they can actually withstand the acidity but when they get to the small intestine the great part is they actually open up their rates so they're not seen talked all the way through and then they never opened the rate parties\nA little idea of what ... means OK I'm Keith anybody seeing it in order for a probiotic\nTo have the word and hear it on the front of the package and it has to last a minimum of sixty minutes within the body okay because I think from consumption to actually get to the small intestine it take sixty minutes to get there and so within its guaranteeing that this probiotic\nIt's going to get to the small intestine and a fully intact all the way through\nSo that's a little idea of the word and ... and in this case with a micro biome actually this particular collection we've made it in the chair shield\nFor the old technology which coated\nBut the new technology is the shield and the shield is basically a pine fiber\nWith pine fat and those together are so strong that they can actually withstand the acidity but when they get to the small intestine the great part is they actually open up their race or they're not seen talked all the way through and then they never opened\nThe rate parties when they get to the intestine the PH level will let those open and then they can call and I forgot oh good\nThat's awesome explanation now the other thing is we have a five dollar off coupon yet the coupon it's only good through Halloween ooh thirty one [laughter] so uh I'm going to get an extra five dollars off solar ray products\nThe a micro biome thirty how probiotics right in the refrigerator case right here to help habit so five dollars off until him through the thirty first they'll come in and get them\nHalloween the news\nAnd I know the heat I wanted to also ask because you've got such great formula here now you also have a colon formula can you go into who should be taking the polling for millennia formula yeah it's Monday\n[laughter] I Know right Colin well the would be I guess you know he definitely has about you're going to think of just pulling issues in general white if you're having a hard time going in the restroom that could be things like diarrhea which probiotics are always going to help you with things of that nature so if you want to

some news here this morning and it's going on and why I was talking about what's happening with our economy don't get nervous\nThese things don't happen in the day but you can set yourself up for success in most people\nDon't set themselves up for success I was having a conversation in the morning or yesterday with some very liberal people and here's what we're finally came down to it because they started calling me I mean it's like\nListen hey you're the one that contacted me so money knows no politics listen to this money knows no politics it doesn't know whether you're white\nRead like me brown like me black\nAsian whatever any color you are it does it know that it doesn't know whether you're Catholic Protestant Jewish Muslim it has no none of that stuff Buddha whatever you call Buddhism\nSpirituality it does it know none of that stuff doesn't know whether you're short\nTall\nDoesn't know whether you're patterns like mayor skinny little Indian didn't know it\nDoesn't know whether you're rich and it doesn't know whether you're poor money only knows trading hands that's it\nIt's a means of getting what we want but it's only knows trading hands okay\nSo what that said most people that I tell him that and I said hey can we agree on that whole man the conversation when death silent I mean it was deafening death funding\nIt doesn't know whether you're Catholic Protestant Jewish Muslim it has no none of that stuff Buddha whatever you call Buddhism spirituality it doesn't know none of that stuff but doesn't know whether you're short\nOr tall\nMoney doesn't know whether you're patterns like mayor skinny fat little Indian didn't know it\nIt doesn't know whether you're rich and it doesn't know whether you're poor money only knows trading hands that's it\nIt's a means of getting what we want but it's only knows trading hands okay\nSo with that said most people that I tell him that and I said hey\nCan we agree on that whole man the conversation when death silence I mean was deafening death funding you could have heard a pin drop on the carpet\n'cause then they had to regroup and assess their thinking because people get seriously money politics those are things that in religion those are things that they get people in a fist fight seriously seriously angry at you\nOr they won't even talk to you anymore so I just laid it out\nThere you go hit took them a while and we agreed to separate and we talk later\nThat we talk of several hours later that day and they go you know what we ... we never looked at it that way it only knows to problems over trade and hands we only know trading hand we only know what we know here's one\nThing that I Try to tell her by and this is what I learned from a billionaire who's going to a program he's in a spiritual program he tells me he said and early on when I was getting sober thirty two years ago he says uh David\nContempt\nInvestigation will keep a person\nAn everlasting ignorance and poverty\nAnd if you want to be that the pride for being with all that was me I can still be that way I'm constantly praying to God humbled me\nHelped me stay home but I don't asking the humble and boy he will\nHelp me stay humble gimme wisdom knowledge and understanding and let me move forward money is a byproduct so anyway let's get back to the point now taking the babbled long enough about that\nI could go all day on this stuff I seriously most people do not take pen to paper\nYou got to sit down with your wife or your husband or your financial advisors and has some serious talks and I was talking to one of my guys at work with ... Mike this morning mind a military investigator by the way I have some of the best\nCitizen journalists in the world were broken five national news stories Fox News picked up two of 'em okay anyway let's get back to the point here most people don't put pen to paper you gotta put pen to paper talk to your advisors and then spend like\nAn hour a day now if you spend an hour a day in thirty days you're going to have what thirty hours that's a lot of hours\nIn a year and you can have three hundred and fifty six hours put into your personal finance\nI Want you to stop and think how many hours or how much time a year you actually put into your personal finance not worrying about it not watching it go up and down but actually putting pen to paper and making a strategy in a plan and put some goals in place to go in place right the planning between those goals and start working it\nAnd then spend like an hour a day now have you spend an hour a day in thirty days you're going to have what thirty hours that's a lot of hours in a year you're going to three hundred and fifty six hours put into your personal finance\nI Want you to stop and think how many hours or how much time a year you actually put into your personal finance not worrying about it not watching it go up and down but actually putting pen to paper and making a strategy in a plan and put some goals in place but a going place\nOr did become billionaires and the thousand airs did to become millionaires so you've got your a thousand there\nAnd you do the same thing that the billionaires during the you become a millionaire and the millionaires do the same thing that the billionaires do and then they become hundred millionaires or ten millionaires fifty millionaires hundred millionaires and then some of them become billionaires but you got to do the same strategies and it's not that hard and anybody with a business can do it\nAll right let me get off of that hundred Ninety two million dollar for those dirty bitcoin thirty thousand back on the game so we're looking at making some trades like that are out there it's just a matter of putting pen to paper see what you got and pulling the trigger now let me get back to one of these stories okay because we are talking\nUm [noise] and here we are where are we at Mike Mike semi some stories here All right we're done with that story and we get back to this one where we're at you want to ... a a a news on Monday here we go All right\nSo Tim Draper let me get back to so I set the story of a famous venture capital investor\nIn bitcoin advocate have predicted bitcoin would reach two hundred and fifty thousand by twenty twenty two well I think it's going to hit it about twenty twenty because it's going to have\nAs soon as it has it's going to become one solid store value and you're going to want to own some coin you can buy with us and then we can do it together okay that that's what I recommend but you could do what you want to do\nA a note here Draper is one who bought the Silk Road bitcoin from the federal government which I talked about earlier okay so he didn't get the Silk Road but he got the confiscated coin\nAlright Draper for further added that the market capitalization of crypto currency would be close to ten trillion dollars well I'd say there's gonna be eighty trillion\nIt's more like an eighty trillion\nNow he's a billionaire or ... in the market guy you know investment guy\nHe these guys think differently because they're looking at the the um the securities end of it this is totally different and he's getting it but you're not going to hear anybody in the world talk about it like I Do okay it's going to end the reason is is it's inflationary\nStore a value and you're going to want to own some point you can buy with us and then we can do it together okay that that's what I'd recommend but you can do what you want to do a\nA note here Draper is one who bought the Silk Road bitcoin from the federal government which I talked about earlier okay so he didn't get the cells grow but he got the confiscated going All right so Draper for further added that the market capitalization of crypto currency would be close to ten trillion dollars while I said it was going to be a trillion\nIt's more like an eighty trillion now he's a billionaire in the market guy you know investment guy\nHe these guys think differently because they're looking at the um the security is the end of it this is totally different and he's getting it but you're not going to hear anybody in the world talk about it like I Do okay it's going to end the reason is is it's inflationary\nNot it's not it's not inflationary it's deflation airy the stock market securities the hot paper money it's inflationary the more you make it causes inflation and more\nCrypto currency is deflation area which means the more you put into it the money's still stays there because there's no more printing of it\nIt gets divided boy it gets divided it's already there it's already there on line all you do it fraction it out\nSo once again for those of you joining us for the first time the the fly Mackey show and I'm your house fly Mackey and we talk about bitcoin we're also President Trump Bible bumping NRA type show that's my mentality\nSo I was arguing with some liberals earlier a ... why do I get into those arguments it's ridiculous you know people want to argue that point here's the deal if you're joining us for the first time money knows no politics zero it only knows trading hands\nSo if you're putting your politics behind your money you're going to lose\nSimple as that don't do it it's the dumbest thing in the world is the bet on politics don't put your bet don't put your financial future if you love your wife or you love your husband or you love your children\nYou're not going to take a hammer and hit them in the towel with it well that's what we do and we put our politics in the way of money money only knows trading hands now the love of money's the root of all evil were not loving it over here but it's a way that we have to pay things\nYou want something you have to have it in order to make a transaction okay so there's nothing wrong with being smart of it that's why I say take an hour a day\nMake plans put pen to paper and I say this all the time put pen to paper and make a plan\nYour first your right to go writes them go and they make a plan to reach each one of those goals and I never thought you become a millionaire I'll tell you this the first time I got there I was like there is no way\nAnd then I was\nTwenty and I go ... that wasn't that hard [laughter]\nOh boy my dad I had a different strategy his was do do everything at it let's see if it works in ... worked for him a lot mother was very conservative Jewish mother Irish Catholic father oh boy Native American kid they adopted me try being a fly on the wall no pun intended those conversations [laughter]\nI didn't know whether I was coming and going anyway hey it is what it is but in the paper right those goals down and then make a plan\nTo reach each one of those puts them goes out there where you never thought you could make it one time I was so wealthy and I gave my well so am I and I we work give her money when they um we were so wealthy at one time\nI was like there is no way and then I

one of their is you have Twitter Facebook you of Instagram as a matter of fact if a bunch of different social media platforms there was another platform called the gab\nOperates similarly to\nTwitter as I understand it\nBut they promised no censorship right\nOr corporate censorship rather I think it's a more appropriate\nPhrase to you know let me share this with you because\nNut job murderer\nThis anti Semite who shot up the synagogue\nShe had to count\nApparently on everything he had to count on Facebook on Twitter he was verified on Twitter\nHe had an account on gab okay\nThis let me open this up\nBand social media platform gab this was a headline after it was revealed that the synagogue murder\nWas a heavy user who posted often about his hatred of Jews\nAnd he posted a lot\nReally awful awful stuff\nThe same stuff that he also posted he posted something similar and same stuff on Twitter\nReally awful stuff on Twitter\nHe it just awful\nSo a spokesman for pay pal confirmed that the company canceled gab the count [noise]\nThey said that there are allowing the the perpetuation of hate violence or discriminatory intolerance\nAnd so they canceled their account\nAnd it and there are other tech companies now as well\nDumping or trying to de platform them\nA go daddy drops gab they gave them twenty four hours to find a new host\nOr completely just beat the platform from the the

they don't have the terms of service they're they're just it's like a free speech free for all\nThat you had pay pal stripe medium everybody's dropped a gab\nThey looking\nAt any other so yeah there were all\nThis this murderer also had Twitter account\nHe was on Twitter he was verified and he said the same stuff on Twitter\nHe said the same thing the same ignorant awful things\nMeanwhile the guy\nThe bomber Caesar or the ... name that\nHe apparently was also on Twitter and Facebook where he posted ridiculous stuff\nAnd he also threatened to threaten people with death\nSometimes I get so many deaths I've already gotten ... death threats because of the stuff\nSometimes you never know which ones are serious and which ones are not to just have to send them all\nI don't understand\nAnd the and the threats that had been\nOn Twitter by the bomber they were ignored\nAnd the murderer who went and shot up the synagogue said some pretty awful stuff on Twitter as well apparently\nIt is just\nI mean it's inconsistent the treatment of Twitter Facebook and then this lesser known service gab\nWhere you had anti Semitic an insane remarks that were shared all of these services but why is only one penalize\nI don't understand that why is only one penalize am I missing something\nAm I missing something came to mind is seen anything why is winding penalize that's what I don't understand when you started\nColumbus they they need a scapegoat and they certainly don't want to use Twitter\nI mean they need some sort of scapegoat to show some sort of responsibility right I guess I have no idea yeah\nDon't know a right it's a little inconsistent it's incredibly inconsistent\nIt's super inconsistent\nAnd it just doesn't\nThat doesn't make any sense\nIs it really about\nThe idea of

that have had one lady a couple of months ago I mentioned this on most of my shows she had a daily headache for Eighteen years\nCame in and worked on our only for an hour out all the knots out of the upper ... all these fun muscle names around her neck and shoulders that I knew were right on that nerve that runs up into their head one of the many nerves that runs up into the head\nAnd when I got done with her she said it was bizarre because she forgot what it felt like not to have a headache for Eighteen years every day she had a headache\nI was a two and a half months ago now in her headaches and not come back\nI've had people that I've had migraines for years and years I've worked on him they come back you know sometimes they come back for monthly maintenance to a couple of times a month once a month just for keep things loosened up this lady's and come back for three months you had ... migrants for seven years\nAfter her migraines situation was and she said had not had one migraine she had a had one slight headache once and she had thrown away all her migraine medications and that's awesome that's really my goal is to get people so they don't have to live with these pains\nI've had one gentleman that had low back pain said he did he knew what he did a injured it was carrying a sack of grain down the stairs at the mill slips slid down the stairs on his back have low back pain every sentence he hadn't worked in the middle for forty years already years\nIt had back pain all the doctors all the specialist all the neurologist physical therapy everything these

specialists all the neurologist physical therapy everything these people had tried\nJust wasn't doing it\nBecause they weren't addressing where the real problem was the stuff I work\nOn the ... you can only find it by\nHuman touch you have to know where to look you have to know what's your feeling for it does not show up on our eyes that does not show up on X rays\nUnless you know what you're doing you know you're not going to fix it and it just really amazes me how people spend tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars through their insurance with all these doctors in special is trying to solve a problem and they come to me and for\nOne visit fifty bucks most of the time I can fix it and one visit some\nYou know but it doesn't always happen in just one visit sometimes people come in two times three times\nYou know to get it worked out because they didn't take adjust to an hour to get all these muscles nodded up like that normally takes years and a lot to do with your your occupation your your daily habits what you do in life how you hold your body how you hold positions of your body\n[noise] again I Do have three locations that I can work on yeah I\nI have Phoenix\nPeoria and good year ah easiest way to look at an appointment at Phoenix or a good year is to call six to three nine seven four three three three three you there's no one there obviously right now it's a business office but you can leave a message thing you want a book on employment\nOr go to my website for the phone numbers\nThat go to Iowa will fix you dot com or a pain management Arizona dot com\nI Do have a lot of great stretching charts stretching is it really important it stretching will help you get temporary relief if you already have the pains but it's really important to do to prevent yourself from getting that\nNot the muscle in the first place because when a muscle is loosened up and stretched\nThen it's more apt to perform better for you with your activities or lack of activities\nI recommend that stretching you know just I mean just about five minutes I mean doesn't have to be long just find a few stretches that are comfortable for you to do do them before you start your day\nIf you work at a desk all day if you sit in an office all day that's even better ... better reason to stretch just because\nYour body as good as ... lock it up us the muscles when you hold them in certain positions that are not just the natural neutral position\nFor long periods of time some of the fibers start getting stuck in the type position once a few fibers get stuck more fibers that are writing connect to do those stuck fibers they start getting stuck to because they can't move either\nStops blood flow you got little pockets of blood trapped in there and that is what forms the not in this and makes the entire muscle field I\nMean I don't even really have to really ...\nYou know just I mean just about five minutes I mean doesn't have to be long just find a few stretches that are comfortable for you to do do them before you start your day\nEven if you work at a desk all day if you sit in an office all day that's even better ... better reason to stretch just because\nYour body as good as ... lock it up you as the muscles when you hold them in certain positions that are not just the natural neutral position\nFor long periods of time some of the fibers start getting stuck in the type position once a few fibers get stuck more fibers that are writing connect to do those stuck fibers they start getting stuck to because they can't move either\nStops blood flow you got little pockets of blood trapped in there and that is what forms the not in this and makes the entire muscle field I\nMean I don't even really have to really massage a muscle very much I Do a little bit too warm it up so it's a little more malleable but then once I start just finding releasing the notch once I've release the Nazi entire muscle just turns the jelly\nIt's just people are just amazed at how relaxed they feel that their shoulders aren't all tense up anymore\nThe pains gone it's a it's really really a really a simple process I don't yawn glad that the government has stepped in and put it restrictions on the opioid prescribing that they're allowed to do because they're just for too long they've been prescribing\nFar too many opioids doctors have not warned about the addictive properties of a lot of these opioids\nAnd uh now they're restricted they for one can I prescribe more than five day prescription at a time without another office visit and they also are required now don't know how many of them are doing it of referring them to\nNon\nMedication based pain treatments such as massage therapy therapeutic massage acupuncture\nJust different natural ways of getting the plight pain to go away or chiropractic that's another good good option for a lot of people but a lot of people do go to chiropractic but I'll tell you if you do see a chiropractor\nYou should really consider getting a massage the same day you're going to get a chiropractic adjustment because a lot of times the reason that your spine is out of alignment is because you have tightened muscles pulling that vertebrae out of alignment\nYou go to the chiropractor snap crackle pop pop back in place but that muscles still tight it's got to pull it right back out to a very short time and then you're going to be spending more money to go back to the chiropractor you get a massage if it's not for me just tell your therapist hey I'm gonna\nI'm gonna go a get a chiropractic adjustment after this massage\nYou know work the muscles along the spy and they'll know to work their wrecked your muscles and that will you know get them loosened up so they can uh\nYour adjustment all stay a lot better\nAnd if you want to a certain stretching regiment ... check out my website that pain management Arizona dot com click on the link to go to the main site there are a bunch of free stretching charts there\nIt's got a great sketch over person in the position of the stretch the muscle is targeting his highlighted and a good description on how to do that stretch

always mentioned that we can really take a lesson from the animal world you know they 'cause you know you look at your your dog or your cat so does your dog or cat wakes up from sleeping the first thing they do is stretch before they start doing dog and cat stuff and that's what we should\nYou know get them loosened up so they can uh your adjustment all stay a lot better\nAnd if you want to a

from the animal world you know they 'cause you know you look at your your dog or your cat so does your dog or cat wakes up from sleeping the first thing they do is stretch before they start doing dog and cat stuff\nAnd that's what we should do in the mornings when we're wake up we get out of bed we should do some stretches before we start doing people's stuff because the body works so much better when it's a little stretched out little loosened up\nAnd we [noise] like I mentioned before I only charge fifty dollars per hour and that's about half the price of what those are other fast food chain of a massage places charge and you're not going to get the quality of care that you get\nThat I I can provide 'cause I did not quit learning when I finished school I kept studying\nI steady several different types of ... massaging mode allergies everything from acupuncture accurate pressure she adds suit time besides Loni Loni\nAnd looked at what the best parts of these are what really works and then I took all those best parts and studied them even further in more in depth compared them to the anatomy of the body the nervous system\nAnd it just really came up with a great system it just

massage places that are popping up everywhere they\nYou know I mean I hate to be mean about it but they really don't have a clue that the owners I've never been in that kind of business they hire managers though one of the ones that worked out the manager that was telling us how to do our job used to manage your shoe store and she's like trying to\nYou know run this place and they all tried to

only one out of one thousand twenty four parts Republican so you don't have to take too much personal blame for this but in a more serious note you know if you take a man who is poor and you tell him he's a poor man\nAnd a loser and what does that make the man happier and stronger\nMake some resentful of angry\nYou take a fat person that you were to ... to call them fat and you bullied him\nIn essence what the left has been doing is bullying the downtrodden in this country which is how Trump came to power to begin with I Know that's a very quietly\nThe left has been bullying the downtrodden in this country for so long and I mean specifically the downtrodden mail in particular for so long\nAnd especially the white male and the white race should have been picked on by the left\nSomehow that's become the the ... the whole Democratic Party which is still ruled by the way by white people even though they make believe that they represent authors it's really sickening\nThey're very racist so they keep demonizing whites white male white male white male not even though the man is either Philippine or a seminal origin he identifies\nAs a white male I don't know if you understand

insane saying the country's being invaded and they're behind the invasion they're going to take away the the few precious resources that I get from this country is a guy a loser living with his mother\nFifty six years old never got anywhere in life\nHe takes out all of his he all of his identity is in his muscles\nAnd ah the identity with a nation in some way you know like a crypto national is I'm not a real nationalism he is almost an actor on the stage of nationalism he doesn't really understand the strength of the nation he's he's he's only the images of the strength of the nation and so you take the twenty thousand marching toward our border\nAnd he's afraid\nWhatever few resources he gets from the country the nation\nAre going to diminish will be taken away from altogether say this is triggering and then you see who's supporting them might they might get hordes who wants to them here the entire Democrat machine\nSo he he takes his heels and it becomes even crazier and so you have to understand how these things work and what gears are in play in the minds of these people\nAnd you're lucky that you have made to explain it to you\nBecause I understand all sides of an argument I always have been able to see things in a multi dimensional fashion then that's not a spectrum thing it's cold intelligence many would say oh that's a spectrum of things that that's an inside joke for those are you on the spectrum it's not really a spectrum thing it's called a a an intelligence they can see many aspects of a thing you know\nSo if you want to comment on what's going on you can on any side but my big question is how is this going to affect them in terms will it affect the election\nIf you're an independent will you stay away from the polls because of this fear that you're going to be associated with Donald Trump and what the Republicans\nOr and the other hand is it making you think your hills in more saying there's nothing to do with me\nI answer the question if you don't mind\nIs this an example of one guy bringing down a party\nEven though it was impotent violence that was a threatened violence\nAnd again going back to what I said earlier in the week trust me I Know what I said I said there was a high probability of a false flag\nSchool intelligence many would say oh that's a spectrum thing that that's an inside joke for those are you on the spectrum it's not really a spectrum thing it's called a an intelligence they can see many aspects of a thing you know\nSo if you want to comment on what's going on you can on any side but my big question is how is this going to affect the midterms will it affect the election\nIf you're an independent will you stay away from the polls because of this fear that you're going to be associated with Donald Trump in what the Republicans\nOr and the other hand if you're making the hills in more saying there's nothing to do with me\nI answer the question if you don't mind\nIs this Neal example um one guy bringing down a party\nEven though was impotent violence that was a threatened violence\nAnd again going back to what I said earlier in the week trust me I Know what I said I said there was a high probability of a false flag event I did not say was certain but even having said that\nThere were elements of the story that don't add up such as the van and the stickers on the windows I don't know how that\nEveryone I Know said the same thing young guys who work for me I mean we picked up on the stickers on them and they said OK runs through your head you are smart leftist okay run the streets had just for a minute don't even call the show how come the Snickers looked like their brand new\nThe Trump stickers and whatnot\nWouldn't they fade into Florida sun\n... they would be faded

program\nLarge thanks for having me\nSo how did they get to this man so quickly what's behind that\nWay police work great police work but the un why pay day\nThe joint terrorism task force which made up of FBI agents in NYPD at New York state troopers and the Federal Bureau of investigation and what they did is they took the forensic evidence from the unexploded bombs and went through it meticulously and forensic Lee\nTo be able to come up with in a evidence which led back to seize or say Iraq as well as fingerprint on one or two of the bombs\nNow that's not always going to be possible but even want to bomb has been set up and has exploded frequently you can still get data from it catch\nYou not only do get data but you can also recreate the\nBomb so one of the things I mean we can we can take it from the Ramsey Yusef a World Trade center bombing in Nineteen Ninety three aware they exploded a car and the\nNYPD and the FBI were able to recreate that car to the point where they came up with a number for the car and the type of explosives and put it together to be able to track it back to Ramzi Yousef to be able to arrest him and satisfactorily convicted where he's still serving time in federal prison\nLet me ask you this in addition to all the physical evidence like fingerprints on DNA would say is our say acts a name naturally have been to some extent on a list anyway because he had prior terrorism on his record\nData from it catch\nYou not only do get data but you can also recreate the\nBomb so one of the things I mean we can we can take it from the

the car and the type of explosives and put it together to be able to track it back to Ramzi Yousef to be able to arrest him and satisfactorily convict him where he still serving time in federal prison\nNow let me ask you this in addition to all the physical evidence like fingerprints and DNA\nWould seize are say acts a name naturally have been to some extent on a list anyway because he had prior terrorism on his record he had ties to both Florida and New York\nAnd would you work at the ... and simultaneously by saying who are the best suspects that we already know may be on in the mix\nBut we don't know if they came to that of eventually they probably would have being that he was in that area the fact that as you properly allude to he had the\nPrior threats of bombings and the fact that uh he was driving around the van that would have probably eventually led to someone making the call if they didn't already\nAt what point do you I don't view it'd be a monumental task I Would imagine but at what point do we need to start screening male or at least packages the same way that people get screened before they go on an airplane where where's that are ridiculous suggestion or physically impossible\nWell I don't know about the physical impossibility of doing it I think it's something that's come out of this case and I'm surprised that they don't do it more often I Know FedEx and UPS de do some kind of screening and to try and determine what they're shipping\nBut the U.S postal service handling billions of pieces of mail a year\nIt may be much more of a difficult task but you would think that if you're going to implement that type of procedure you would start so with packages and work your way back to potentially envelopes and or anthrax\nDetective risk and that's exactly what I'm thinking of and I know that\nI fly I don't know a dozen times a year most of it for work but I Know that when I'm walking through the line and my my years being scanned that they're looking at a screen and the to some extent that thing is color coded it makes me think that\nMay be an automated system could at least ... some of the more obvious ones because I you know I Know that some of this is a closely held piece of information\nBut I Know just by looking at the system that things show up differently on that screen depending on what kind of material they're looking at are they looking at fabric or they're looking at metal are they looking at the inside of a laptop and what does a legitimate laptop battery look like and what does the laptop battery look like\nAnd what does a piece of plastic pipe look like if it's filled with some kind of powder I mean it could be ... or it could be full of explosives and I would imagine in this day and age ah we've got such good technological tools\nThat you'd think you might be able to scan many thousands of packages and just have the computer said to say when you see one that ... that fits a certain set of criteria pick that one side and then we'll take a closer look at it and then you might be able to do these packages\nIs an excellent point and I'm surprised we don't do it already what came out of this case is that we don't do it to that proportion\nLook at an airport when you when I go through the screener and no matter what Loni Iran it goes there something suspicious shows up in that package which calls for secondary screening it kicks it out of the machine to ...\nGentlemen laptop battery look like and what does the laptop battery look like and what does a piece of plastic pipe look like if it's filled with some kind of powder I mean it could be ... or it could be full of explosives and I would imagine in this day and age uh we've got such good technological tools\nThat you'd think you might be able to scan many thousands of packages and just have the computer said to say when you see one that ... that fits a certain set of criteria kick that one side and then we'll take a closer look at it and then you might be able to do these packages\nIs an excellent point and I'm surprised we don't do it already what came out of this case is that we don't do it to that proportion look at an airport when you when I go through the screener\nAnd no matter what line Iran it goes there if something suspicious shows up in that package which calls for secondary screening it kicks it out of the machine kicks it out of the conveyor belt to a second conveyor belt I don't know why we couldn't look to do that in the U.S postal service\nSend you wouldn't necessarily have to do with the human beings sitting there slowly examining each one if you know that a computer never gets tired you know if his scanning looking for particular characteristics\nIt never gets tired and never has an off they had never had the day when you didn't get your second cup of coffee and the computers should and now I'm not saying the machines are everything but if you need to scan hundreds of thousands of baggage is I don't know how you could do it unless you had an army of people saying they're looking at screens all day\nWhere you wouldn't do it we don't do it at the airport where we do is we have a screener\nWho is alerted by a computer screen that there's something that calls for secondary screening at that\nWith this package and that's what kicks it out so if you're a package was delayed by or if my package was delayed by a day or so I wouldn't mind if it needs a secondary screening and therefore was put into separate line and had to then be done by a human or even the second machine to us\nTo a third point where a human then looks at it because I think that the safety of our postal employees and the people who are delivering the mail and people where it's going into a male Roman certain buildings around this country you know the safety of our people\nIn our citizens are paramount to law enforcement as well as everyone else in this country\nNicely said now tell me this one else have we missed and what else have we learned about this one that we ought to be doing differently if anything\nWell I I think what we learned is how well law enforcement can come upon\nSomeone who is looking to do us harm and how quickly law enforcement agencies around this country this happened to be kudos the NYPD the FBI and the joy terrorists task force and the postal inspectors but you know it it shows what law enforcement\nAround this country and what cops do every single day and every single jurisdiction to keep our people safe and how quickly they'll find you if you plan to do an act of terrorism in this country and threatened the people of any city or any jurisdiction the police will get you\nThey will arrest you and you will spend the rest of your life in jail\nSay Iraq is now looking at fifty eight years with just the five charges they charged him with today I think they'll add additional charges as other things are found it'll be a life sentence either way even fifty eight years it's fifty six years is a life sentence for him and he deserves every single day of it if not the death penalty\nI absolutely agree one last thing in about forty seconds and that is do you believe based on what we know and I know you're not you know in that position the crime lab is do you think he intended for any of these to go on for nearly to have devices that we're real old enough to really terrorize people\nAsked director race said today the director of the FBI these were functional devices he didn't say\nAnd threatened the people of any city or any jurisdiction police will get you\nThey will arrest you and you will spend the rest of your life in jail\nSay is now looking at fifty eight years with just the chargers they charged with today I think they'll add additional charges is other things are failed it'll be a life sentence either way even fifty eight years it's fifty six years as a life sentence for him and he deserves every single day of it is not the death penalty\nI absolutely agree one last thing in about forty seconds and that is do you believe based on what we know when I Know you're not you know in that position the crime lab is do you think he intended for any of that used to go on for nearly have devices that we're real old enough to really terrorize people\nAsked director race said today the director of the FBI or functional devices he didn't say if they were capable of going out but they ... they were put together in a way that they could have gone off and potentially hurt somebody\nThat has never been the way that conservatives have behaved so you're asking for something that goes way outside\nOf our usual behavior I mean most of the Tea Party a protest ones that I went to and ones that I saw in other cities and indeed see on television\nThey were incredibly civilized event whereas you you look at the average left wing event a good example January of twenty Seventeen after Donald Trump's inauguration\nThe crazy women's march ... you know the fact is\nThere's nothing wrong with women saying we want to be treated equally an equitable okay it's already in the law was would you like we'd like to burn some limousines we'd like to stage a protest in which people have their safety threatened and that causes a lot of trouble and gets us on TV I think that's what's crazy\nAlthough as I say I don't want to mention was Madonna telling telling us chilling support Trump and that's not black oh\nIs often fantasize dreamed of blowing up the White House that's what McDonald's said and that is wacko is well and yet you know that if\nA Republican had said this very same words in the very same tone of voice CNN would be running it in a video loop but if Madonna says it they say look what a strong powerful feminist she there's adult there is a really strong double standard\nAnd done I I Love journalism I'd been in a long time and I love the craft I was in it as a reporter without my opinion uh being being shown in my stories and as a talk show host I give my opinions every day\nI'm proud of journalism but I'm not proud of what journalism has become because we have people who are supposed to be reporters and keep their opinions out who are inserting their opinions I worked my tail off and\nShe is often fantasize dreamed of blowing up the White House that's when Madonna said and that is wacko as well and yet you know that if\nA Republican had said this very same words in the very same tone of voice CNN would be running it in a video loop but if Madonna says it they say look what a strong powerful feminist she there's adult there is a really strong double standard\nAnd done I I Love journalism I'd been in a long time and I love the crap I was in it as a reporter without my opinion uh being being shown in my stories and as a talk show host I give my opinions every day\nI'm proud of journalism but I'm not proud of what journalism has become\nBecause we have people who are supposed to be reporters and keep their opinions out who are inserting their opinions I worked my tail off and the proof that I think I kept my opinions out of my stories is that when I went\nFrom being a reporter on television or radio to being a talk show host there were folks I'd run into both strangers and people I knew who say you're a conservative and I said yeah\nI'm a conservative ... well I never knew that\nAnd I said what you think I was a life you worked on television I thought you were a liberal I said well clearly I kept my opinion out of my reporting which is what reporters are supposed to do\nThe other thing that's dangerous to the entire profession\nIs if you tell people when we cover stories were going to cover them in a double standard that in other words if one group of people says something or does something we're going to tell this kind of story but if somebody else from the other side does precisely the same thing or something so similar there is nearly identical\nWe're going to treat the story entirely differently\nI mean constantly I look up at these two screens in my studio one was Fox on one with CNN on a big big screen TVs\nAnd I and I look at them and I see them saying with no proof Donald Trump says X or y or Z and I thought during the entire eight years of a bomb uh I never once saw them say\nWith no proof whatsoever Brock Obama today claimed to blah blah blah and I thought the ... there ... there were plenty of times I mean when when when one broad Obama was asked do you know that the IRS has been going out and denying as\nConservative groups free speech rights by denying their applications for tax free status head no he said oh the first I knew about it was one I saw it on the news and I thought\nThat at a bold faced lie you can't\nMake as you can't tell us on one hand you're a Harvard educated lawyer and your ... according to your fans one of the smartest guys on the planet\nAnd then turn around and say no I was completely clueless\nAs ...

your phone calls and emails on this First Amendment friday night but I also want to talk to my friend Dr Henry Miller and you know him as a senior fellow at the Pacific research Institute published in a lot of places both scholarly journals that are way beyond my ability to read and the popular press as well Dr Miller welcome back\nGood to be with you it was\nSo we've got a lot of other threats in this world obviously today we've been spending a lot of time talking about the bomber and that sort of thing and I wanted to grab you on a couple of those things at the end of this interview but would you mind talking about the fact that we see continued that bridge to try to ban plastic here and banned plastic there\nAnd the fact is I thought plastics has actually been one of the things we had done that actually made our lives we take it for granted but it's made our lives a whole lot safer from a lot of the threats of human beings have faced literally for thousands of years and plastic as the way we've escape from some of those threats\nOh absolutely and in fact uh as I wrote this article about it go fundamentalists attacks on plastics or I thought back to the Nineteen sixty seven film the graduate or and you may remember that\nUh Dustin Hoffman plays the title role and she said his graduation party and and the guy comes up to him and says a ban I have one word for you\n... and a and a half century since then plastics have really revolutionized are so many industries\nUh and uh you know when I was training and and medicine we had just converted from glass bottles for intravenous solutions and blood to plastic bottles and it was such a remarkable improvement they store better if they keep better they're safer\nBecause inevitably glass bottles which would be dropped a and the ... the glass on the floor and you would you would never get up and people would get caught and\nWith a and you may remember that uh Dustin Hoffman plays the title role and he said his graduation party and I'm a guy comes up to him and says a fan I have one word for you\nTime ribs and as a and a half century since then plastics have really revolutionized are so many industries\nAre and uh you know when I was training and and medicine we had just converted from glass bottles for intravenous solutions and blood to plastic bottles and it was such a remarkable improvement they store better they keep better they're safer\nBecause inevitably glass bottles which would be dropped a and the ... the glass on the floor and you would you would never get up and people would get caught and and so on a but\nMedical devices or electronics all sorts of things\nUh plastics had been really a revolution and yet the activists continue to attack it a Earth Day in April of this year was a devoted to ending plastic pollution quote unquote and um we continue to have a\nA tax on various plaster size or things that make plastics pliable and more convenient or like this ... a BPA um and the attacks just go on and on and on a a base with or without much basis um and without\nThinking about it carefully and considering the science\nWell and I thought about that too because I Know a lot of people say well you know there's food safety but I buy my food in tin cans when a lot of people may not appreciate is those so called tin cans with ... which had very little pin in them\nAre actually lined with as you said BPA and other kinds of things that make\nA tin can a whole lot more safe for containing any kind of food you buy the grocery store and and and I and the plastics you know dark I think about the plastics where products you know including a lot of\nFood products are package sometimes hermetically sealed and you know the air and taken out or some other kind of gas put in so that so that everything last longer and or is or is better and better protected against the kind of common contamination they could literally take your life or a few decades ago\nYou're you're absolutely right and you you bring up a lot of a broader point which is\nThat you have to you have to do it the risk analysis folks called comparative risk assessment you have to ask if you if you eliminate a product day what are you substitute for what are you left with a and so we're seeing that in California because there's a\nA a state senator who keeps introducing bills to ban Styrofoam containers from restaurants for takeout and for a for\nHot beverages or cold averages and uh it seems popular because we see a Styrofoam trash around but the alternative of course his paper or which is\nI'm more a consumptive of oil and electricity interestingly um\nBy the way I Want people to take note of that and the fact that they say well this or do you START I remember the McDonald's Styrofoam clam shells they'd put hamburgers and because it both inflated and kept the juice worried belong\nAnd they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill and when I went on research in a long time ago I had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coded paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last as long in the landfill ... maybe the Styrofoam would degrade over a you know hundreds of years\nHot beverages or cold temperatures and uh it seems popular because we see a Styrofoam trash around but the alternative of course is paper which is\nI'm more a consumptive of oil and electricity interestingly um\nBy the way I Want people to take note of that and the fact that they say well this or do you START I remember the McDonald's Styrofoam clam shells they'd put hamburgers and because it both inflated and kept the juice worried belong\nAnd they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill and when I went out and research in a long time ago\nI had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coded paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last as long in the landfill it it may be the Styrofoam would degrade over a you know hundreds of years and the paper will degrade over fewer hundreds of years am I right about those numbers are you are my aunt or\nDo you are absolutely right that if the other thing is that the police the Iranian uh generates less waste water and also occupies less space and landfill\nAnd the other thing is that we have we now have bacteria that will degrade a Styrofoam and and other plastics and the landfill so you know that this that these objections these attempts to band things are just not well founded and well thought out\nSo which is typical of what we say about the anti corporate anti technology a pickle fundamentalist\nHey I Want to ask you about something else 'cause about about an hour ago I was talking to a guest a who's a former police detective we were talking about the bomber you know the bombs that went through the males and he said well what he ... he thought it was interesting that we found out he was he was a ... a retired top investigator for New York city's police department\nAnd he said we found out the postal service has things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about other kinds of contraband whether it's illegal drugs from Asia\nOr we're seeing a stuff come through that it's that marijuana good ship that way and if states haven't decided to legalize it it shouldn't be ship\nAnd I asked him we had this technology we see at the airport and I you know while I don't know all the particulars of it I Know that when they watch your bag with computers and cell phones and this and batteries and all that goes through\nThey know what color the screen is supposed to be and they know what colors indicate it may be some kind of contraband whether it's a fluid liquid or possibly explosive\nYou know I don't know what color explosive comes up as because I Would imagine I haven't been through the TSA line when somebody whose putting explosives through but my understanding is the color coding helps them spot those things pull him aside and do some more examination I said if you wanted to scan hundreds of thousands of uh packages the postal service carried\nCould we do that and could we say to a computer\nWhen a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray you know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that they may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside\nAnd and let somebody else take a closer look at it that's all the technology to ditch within our grasp isn't it\nIt it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... in red flag and pass all are in fact it's my understanding that\nChecked baggage is a analyze that way as well as the the the package that you put the put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strangers doing their job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that this\nX ray could we X ray you know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that they may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside\nAnd and let somebody else take a closer look at it that's all the technology to ditch within our grasp isn't it\nIt it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... in red flag and pass all are in fact it's my understanding that\nChecked baggage is a analyze that way as well as the the package that you put put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strangers doing the job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that the stuff that's going through the post office gets scanned by that same kind of thing I think the public would be all for it\nYeah I think we could certainly do that for packages or you know flat flat letters a could probably sail through and and maybe do it just for packages that's a very good idea or as\nWell I just it just struck me that if that's within our grasp but I'm the same guy who wants to see a chicken irradiated before it gets into the supermarket so we can kill all the salmonella or the other bacteria that he'd call I'd that's on the exterior of it is it isn't a cure all\nPeople freak out and and and unfortunately with bears a you know that panic attack us off in the ... you know will trigger the bears to act aggressively\nHere Joe I thought you were keeping most of the nuts in Virginia and the purple part of the state around Richmond is don't you try to keep him confined up there\nWhen we try to at least get them elected to office and then they can do crazy things like you know go ... on a board member from a jails to try to get you know our

of different names but it's him on the Twitter and him on the Facebook it's like there's two different identity\nWhen you see stuff like that in a very very very suspicious one name she's her\n\nOut to Ari Ron ...\nAnd then he has this other name that's different that they're saying is is official name so what do you think about that use Cesar ...\nRon ... an itch him on Facebook and all these videos at Trump rallies\nAnd then there's official name or at least by the police Caesar I'll tear say August so it gets weirder and weirder meanwhile\nAnd you knew what listeners ... needs needs were

do you know it's fake it's like where do you start you don't know exactly what's going on\nBut none of it adds up it's ridiculous\nAnd why would a Trump supporter bomb and do that and then it's not real bombs and then there are all pre programming that's coming in imminent and when it comes it's our fault\nAnd they're of course blaming Rush Limbaugh and Matt Drudge and myself and President Trump and there is no talkers college no talk of Rand Paul no talk on the ice people getting killed no talk of cops that are murder you know five cops shoppers hardly any coverage by black lives matter\nAnd then this nobody gets hurt it's fake bombs it's like the end of the world right now the Democrats are going to want to now it's ... ... it's ridiculous\nIt's like you've got suicide bombings every day

you might have done the work on his computer but a\nPrinter had to create those and the FBI I'm sure knows who who uh printed them and when if they were created you know in the last two weeks\nIt's

God Bless Trump ... Trump Trump forever you know it's all part of it for the next twelve days but I think it's going to have the reverse effect the van and so obviously a bogus part of a\n... well actually it is nobody I Know buys that did this whole thing is real and now this is MORNING EDITION of box in New York on the road map bragging Alex Jones or an aerospace engineer on the bombings what do you think about not just the the fake bombing and the fact bombs but now that\nWell the thing I wanted to point out about the the state bombs being a\nEvent orchestrated for maximum\nPolitical effect that it took him over three days to to send it to believe declared these things I mean on first glance Alex any competent intelligence agent or\nA bomb experts would say no no way I mean the the L E do you think that the dollar store elite the device with a one point five ... watch battery doesn't have the kind of uh\nYeah it's all part of it for the next ... days but I think it's going to have the reverse effect the van and so obviously a bogus part of a\n... well actually it is nobody I Know buys that did this whole thing's Rio and now this is MORNING EDITION of box in New York only or with Matt reckon Alex Jones or an aerospace engineer on the bombings what do you think about not just the the fake bombing and the fact bombs but now the\nWill of the bail on a to point out about the the state bombs being a\nPolitical event orchestrated for maximum\nPolitical fact is that it took him over three days to to send it to believe declared these things I mean first glance Alex any competent at intelligence agent or a or\nA bomb experts would say no no way I mean they ... do you think that the dollar store elite the device with a one point five ... watch battery doesn't have the kind of\nA outputs or even a triggers or gait flooded cave in to do it so the fact that I I have a difficult time accepting that it took them three days\nA to tell us this I mean I certainly hope not honest with me they are really dumb or or they deliberately how this uh information from maximum political fact which latte or I think is definitely the case I forgive the Don lemon and the ... puts his crimes to to\nMilk it which is what they've been doing these last three days [noise] uh it said sure it's a cheesy October surprise and if this is the best they got I mean uh it's pretty pretty bad [laughter] so I\nKnow I agree it's a really cheesy October surprise and that's why I'm really concerned that this is a distraction from something bigger ... like you said I Want to get boxers tank first an attack on that care of and that just like\nJames Woods and you and I predicted they wouldn't be on but they got trucks bringing them up right on time a few days before and claim some militia right winger shoots these phones what do you think box\nWell I'll tell you what I I Do think that um that\nObviously it's staged that one too and uh it's the ... gene sharp ... technique of sort of roping your target\nBeing Trump into and untenable media position by having like pregnant women and children up front and then what the the the guards have to sort of like either physically restrain them or shoot them or something with a rubber bullets or something so this is a way to sort of\nLike a ... an attempt not it's not going to be a successful but sort of rope Trump and and this is the ...\nAnd that's why they share their ... borders no borders no wall know usa at all and the good news huge\nLou Dobbs James was just not to sound shows now it's Rush Limbaugh all saying this is a false flag this is John it's fake everyone agrees I think that's the real moment we cross steer botch it now and I like to say I'm becoming on obsolete in a way and that's why they sent all the news the Republican Party has now been Alex Jones or size\nWell no you just met reality it's not me people now have in common sense it shaped British saying now box right points thank you Matt comments on

Trump analysis shows you're going to bomb innocent ... with no evidence and it pops up right on time I mean it's not exactly\nExactly it's not hard and and but the thing is that you've got lots of people out there that actually believe in television is that's all they know they've been raised on television or anything and everything that they've ever known as been on television like in the movie network right I mean you\nKnow the thing we tell them what to say exactly\nExactly exactly and and then they eat it up and when they censoring you and you can't ... you can't counterpoint to anything and then people are we going to keep the fake\nNews like here in Canada where all our news agencies ... all the fake news from the United states and re packages\nAnd sells it to us I mean they don't even mention about the care of them going on I don't even mention about uh the connection with add on to show he and his I don't know if this was a brother or a cousin and then you have to

is just too obvious\nAnd there's some weird reason it reminded me of Las Vegas I don't know why but it just had that weird feel that\nAnd when they censoring you and you can't you can't counterpoint to anything and then people are we going to take a big news like here in Canada all around you can eat ... all the fake news from the United states and re packages\nAnd sells it to us I mean they don't even mention about the caravan going on I don't even mention about the collection would add on to show he and and I don't know if it's a brother or a cousin and then you have to show you got killed who had links to ice right it just goes on and on and on I mean\nYou see this things lifted the ban it you know when when I saw that Dan I'm like wait a second that that that is just too obvious\nAnd for some reason it reminded me of Las Vegas\nI don't know why but it just had that weird feel that it was just Las Vegas the thing about it\nOh I Know since we didn't buy Los Vegas they shut that down real quick segment called you wrap points that you\nGo ahead oh he's gone Charlotte you know two point man I Want to come back and just heavy briefing they'll let you go yeah but\nWhat the negative is though because I agree with the shows they admit when the exit polls and and people that have been pulled that are record numbers Republicans\nTurning out they're turning out in the mid term why it is a general election every four years this is every to show hey what might they pulled and ... and the next year and a half days stop dish and B how could they grab victory from the jaws of defeat and then\nWhat do they do when they lose big time which all the numbers show because this is not a regular lecture the political once in a three generation political realignment just what's happening right now\nWhere are you going to last ... sorry go ahead\nYeah the last caller was saying it so it's like a Hollywood so but you know what people are hip to that to look at the movies shooter was based on point of impact the whole idea of patties and black and false flags it's mainstream now you know people when they see that van they laugh\nSo I don't think it's going to have the effect they're still living in the old days when they could manipulate us we now are hip to false wax we're we're we notice\nAnd they couldn't help but make it all be perfectly rafting clean and popping clearly in a production instead of like an old sticker or something 'cause that would take something oh that would take some work it's easy to get a new van and plaster all this on it it's

earlier in the week trust me I Know what I said I said there was a high probability of a false flag event I did not say was certain but even having said that\nThere were elements of the story that

know for it and say look we're going to offer more protection for all of these political you know a democratic followers and things like that because I think about it is is that if he keeps on the tweeting\nAnd the longer that this airplane on the selection of what we're trying to discover here about the alleged bomber\nWe keep the media doesn't regulate their coverage on the discovery of this farmer\nIt could actually end up helping Trump as long as he keeps his nose clean because my concern is this caravan we're going to have a crescendo right now and it's kind of climax just\nHours before the election and they're going to show all of the national guard and they're going to turn it on trial and the whole thing is just going to create this medium ... what's the narrative is look at this guy Trump look what he's doing look at the on humanitarian effort that he's\nA well that's why they have to be stopped by the Mexican military in Mexico and and not be allowed within hundreds

um you asked your two hundred times less stems cells and what you started with now think about this though\nYou have to have to stem cells to grow new tissue so you've never had a tissue grown or your growing in size a brain neurology intestines all you have to have the same cells to develop all that stuff so of course that makes sense why we have so many more during that time but what happens over time if they start to they recycle only so many times and then they just stop\nSo we don't he owes vast when they get older and so there was a great example and I went to a seminar about a month ago and um\nUtah and it was a new procedure for stem cells and bone spurs and how to get rid of those um and they said about a baby that rolls down a set of stairs pick it up they laugh it off okay maybe a crowd a little bit but they laugh it off and they got a new toy and they go and they do something else right and no big deal\nI'm Sorry but if I rolled down his that as as you better\nDown nine one one when we're done [laughter] probably be hurting the ice packs I Want to make sure everything's working and you know we don't bounce\nDown and think about an eighty year old you know when when they fall or hurt themselves you know um they just don't respond as well the immune system starts to get shut down says don't forget stem cells also go after the immune system in the immune system is designed as hum is operated by the nervous system\nSo when you have stem cells um ... and you have a lot of them you end up you end up doing much better\nYou end up repairing better [noise] and so stem cells are necessary to rebuild and regenerate issue\nThey get up they laugh it off okay maybe a crowd a little bit but they laugh it off and they'd rather new toy and they go and they do something else right and no big deal I'm Sorry but if I roll down a set of stairs you better\nDown nine one one when we're done [laughter] I'm I'm probably be hurting the ice packs I Want to make sure everything's working and you know we don't bounce back of\nSouth and think about an eighty year old you know when when they fall or hurt themselves you know um they just don't respond as well the immune system starts to get shut down for don't forget that was also go after the immune system in the immune system is designed is um is operated by the nervous system\nSo when you have stem cells um ... and you have a lot of them you end up you end up doing much better\nYou end up repairing better [noise] and so stem cells are necessary to rebuild and regenerate issue this has been around for decades folks it might be a new to you because you know we're just getting it up to the public like on this radio station\nBut it's been around for decades look back in Nineteen oh eight there was a theory that there was a cell that was a master cells that was developing us and then in ... and look at the history on the Internet there's accustomed cool stuff I'm In Nineteen sixty three they were actually starting to use the stem cells and recognizing this potential and it's a power\nAnd then in Nineteen sixty eight they actually did their vote first bone marrow transplant which is worst themselves actually are\nUm and then in Nineteen Ninety eight to George Bush you know a a minister Asian went ahead and stocks\nThe study is themselves but let's clear this up there is a mess out there the myth is that stem cells only come from fetuses and from embryos of abortions that it's not true\nThey actually have stem cells in the ad in the Arctic sack\nWith which you and I grew up in okay for nine months and then it's in the cord and so you have a high concentration of stem cells in these areas these are legal in the United states\nI'm back in Nineteen Ninety eight there was some bad things that were happening unfortunately people were taking advantage of money got involved I think what's happened is often and they had to kind of eradicate that they are doing it in other parts of the world\nYou know for some things that you know we're not doing here because of these ethical laws um but you know right now the stem cells that are available to you if you're having pain in your joints\nUm don't wait I've got my own small testimony with a robocop neon today you know I'm I'll share that and just a minute but you know I Want you also really understand that this might not this might be a new to you but it's not new to science\nAnd so when you come into the clinical you come to my seminar on Tuesday night at six thirty\nI'm I'm going to teach you about these things I'm going to actually sit down I'm going to make sure that you are educated you make an informed choice ah with all the knowledge that you have an or take at least that next step together more knowledge look this is your body\nI'm Jennifer what kind of car are you today remember we talked about that\nYes well right now might that I did I not jaguar jaguar okay\nSo so right about ... titles I Love that [laughter] I'm only half of that alone is not on a cell jaguar so we're looking at a convertible\nOf course so ... so what do you drive at the top down I've choir okay um and All right Jamie return

Thirteen Years and it never had issues with it so I kinda liked that idea\nWell when did you guys let me know get a caller and solve we'll see if we can fix it okay [laughter] so I ...\nAt least that next step together more knowledge look this is your body I'm Jennifer what kind of car are you today remember we talked about that\nYes well right now I I did I not jaguar jaguar okay so\nSo writes about your titles I Love that [laughter] I'm only half of that alone not on a cell jaguar so we're looking at a convertible\nCar so that ... you drive at the top down I've choir okay um and All right Jamie return what kind of car you know the it's called different that your body what is your car what are you driving to the rest of your life\nYou know what I'm trying to get the RV hey beautiful I I\nMy theory for Thirteen Years and it never had issues with it so I kinda liked that idea\nWell when I was let me know get a caller and solve we'll see if we can fix it okay [laughter] so I you know I'm a ...\nD convertible spider I Love that right and I'm thinking what is your C. R. V. I just might drop it down and put some ... some twenty chews on it you know but maybe not maybe that's what you like driving so whenever you are\nAsked yourself right now what are you\nSome people like to be a sea RV some people like to be a tank or the front line but on the football field right some people are like ... like ... or their motorcycles ... the ... is what I was thinking whatever it is you are this is the only vehicle you're going to get for lice\nDon't take it for granted look your body's going to talk to you\nWe called body language it's not crossing the arms are opening up its not leaning forward into somebody to drive a point or set back to accept some knowledge right I don't know what position you're in right now hopefully you're sitting back in Seventy knowledge but you know his body language so when your body starts talking to you you do need to listen\nSo I'm gonna tell my story now because I didn't listen as well as I should have I'm going to tell them myself\nAnd six years ago I was right in the tendency mountains and\nI had a bicycle crash I was by myself and it was a ten mile ride I was about a two to four miles and and I didn't break anything everything was working right now I'm a doctor I can evaluate this right with nobody around and see if I should walk out or ride out I could write out it was no big deal\nBut I had a big old he was home or a big bruise on my inside of my side and you know and I got home after riding the next six to eight miles out I was black and blue all the way from my my uh or my leg attached to my body all the way down to my calf I'm like oh that's not good that was really dumb\nBut for the last six years I just had some nuts and my legs are trying to do some ultrasound insects and they are just must be scar tissue no big deal well apparently there was more damaging their because about two months ago my knee started kind of acting up and I've never damage my knees in my life\nI was a wrestler was a runner all that kind of stuff never and then about three weeks ago I could hardly get up and down stairs\nSo I wouldn't have him or I'd done over a valley radiologist an amazing group of people um they're very high and so if you have a choice they and smile I Love them but I went over there um and I found out that I had torn three muscles on the inside of my leg\nAnd that the inside of them I mean that's just on my knee was actually starting to fray we're starting to shreds\nAnd I'm like okay you know I Need to see the family out of tissue and Dr Miller phenomenal phenomenal injection is his mind that they have the medical doctor for the last two years we work together\nI had him and Jack ... and I've got a robocop me a new I mean I just got a knee brace on an ... races he's nine to unload the inside that need so we're not working harder in order to try to rebuild under duress and stress while I'm Still helping\nPeople in the clinic so I started with body language so my body was telling me something for six years but because it wasn't really detrimental I could still function and run and hike and stuff like that and ride bikes weightless\nAnd I found out that I have two and three muscles on the inside of my life and that the inside of my ... on my knee was actually starting to free it was starting to shreds\nAnd I'm like okay you know I Need to see the survey on the other issue in Dr Miller phenomenal phenomenal injection us he's my ... medical doctor for the last two years we've worked together\nI had him inject and I've got to robocop me a new I mean I just got a knee brace on ... races designed to unload the inside that need so we're not working harder in order to try to rebuild under duress and stress while I'm Still helping people\nIn the clinic so I started with body language\nSo my body was telling me something for six years but because it wasn't really detrimental I could still function and run and hike and stuff like that and ride bikes waitlist I just didn't think there was much there I didn't and I'm a doctor and I and I should've I should've done something and I didn't\nSo folks if you're not a doctor I don't think you know more either I thought I did but if you have an injury and your past and it's just even a slight something or other that means there's at least fifty percent dysfunction occurring there because you don't get a symptom until that happens\nSo don't wake call the clinic called six zero to nine nine to two six five six six to nine nine two to six five six only for healthy habits am I doing complimentary councils that rule changed last week\nOkay so make sure you mentioned that you heard me on healthy habits Jamie Jennifer a dance tunes chair any of the poison here told you to come see me or you heard me on the radio or just mentioned the name and it will be complementary outside of that there is a small city in order to be able to do the consultation\nAnd an examination on that area to tell you what's next where I'm going to send you around going to help you and I'm looking forward to seeing you in the Clinton\nSo just to wrap this up for everyone listening is what you're saying is do not ignore it it's not going to go away when a pain happens um see somebody right away about it I mean because you can't just think oh it'll go away right\nNow without damage [laughter] right exactly yeah I mean I I mean you'll\nJust get more damage and more damage than when you start seeing the signs listeners you know how Dr frost again mentioned healthy habit it's going to be free what do you have to lose you know\nSo yeah people say what do I have to pay that attention [laughter] I don't really love those are going to cost you a little bit of time yes that's it but\nYou know there there's no money that has to come out of your pocket to find out if it's the right solution for you but look if you're already on drugs if you're already on opiates if you're trying to suppress you know the pain that's coming in I'm pleased with at least a decrease that or or get your life back\nUm you know we're helping the military when I was when I was in the home show over Westworld this weekend was amazing\nThe military personnel that were coming in and I'm like guys I Know you were pushed for Twenty years but now it's time to fix you or maybe it was only four years so\nLet's world this weekend was amazing the military personnel that were coming in yeah like I Know you were pushed for Twenty years but now it's time to fix you or maybe it was only four years so\nUm I Would have definitely done clinical exam on your which I'm actually if you don't mind before we leave here today I Want to I Would like to check your shoulder out if I'm not sure okay and let's just validate now what I heard immediately was body language mhm\nNah I worked in a nursing home ... I was the head orderly\nI got to roll patience and change sheets invade them I understand what all that means yeah and that's hard hard work and it takes a special person to do that\nAnd that's why I don't do it anymore [laughter] I went into a different fields because I just couldn't do that but you know I understand the stress in the strain or what ended up happening was your body it didn't just whisper to you I'm assuming it didn't have a whisper ahead of time right now but if you needed was like the childhood that a little pinprick writes screen [noise]\nAnd yeah I had to listen to me 'cause this is not good that's right and the end result you were telling me earlier if I remember I was just general bones burner yes okay um and did you hear anything that you tear a labor them which is that cartridge around the edges of joint\nYou know so when they did the X ray and set the for the surgery they said they thought there was a hair yeah ... when they went in there and they said they didn't see its hair okay with mainly the bone spurs that was probably causing the pain that makes sense you know\nPopping is not necessarily a bone spur so I ran the probability there's other things going on we're not going to solve on the radio today but\nI'm living in a well number one is it sounds like you're probably we're doing everything right and how to compromise issue prior to maybe if you played sports that you went through college are you grew up as a kid and had Fifteen hundred spinal traumas and shoulder troubled by the time you were Thirteen to compromise and then it finally just if finally just reached out to you and said hey you need to pay attention to me\nThe fact that you went through everything that you did\nAnd still couldn't figure it out those are the kinds of patients that I actually like to have come into my clinic because oftentimes we can help people that have been through that so if it's a bone spur we do unfortunately have to tell people that there's a possibility you might have to have you know or just stop at surgery to remove that\nAnd how do we just stem cells after that in order to regenerate and rebuild that just should because people get an amazing results\nAfter they cleaned up so I Do recommend surgery at times but it is the last result the last thing I Want to do is that oh no you're going to be fine do you know and the other issue on you\nKnow kind of growth factors and and the themselves on you and knowing that there's a bones brother probably aggravating and sharing tissue at the same time because from what I can see in all the studies that I have seen and done over the last two years I've only seen one person would appear that the\nAnd then it finally just do it finally just reached out to you and said hey you need to pay attention to me the fact that you went through everything that you did\nAnd still couldn't figure it out those are the kinds of patients so I actually like to have come into my clinic because oftentimes we can help people that have been through that so if it's a bone spur we do unfortunately have to tell people that there's a possibility you might have to have you know or just GOP surgery to remove that\nAn average of stem cells after that in order to regenerate and rebuild that issue because people get are are amazing results\nAfter they cleaned up so I Do recommend surgery at times but it is the last result the last thing I Want to do is that oh no you're going to be fine do you know and the other issue on you\nKnow kind of growth factors and and the themselves on you\nAnd knowing that there's a bones brother probably aggravating and sharing tissue at the same time because from what I can see in all the studies that I have seen and done over the last two years I've only seen one person would appear that the bone spur actually started to go away I'm outside of that there's no documentation but I Know that valid as that but what they talk about on another part of the program\nHow bone spurs are now starting to\nDissolve or start to go way mhm um and it's with nutrition and I would like to talk about that and and you can tell them if you have that in the store here as well but you know um\nBut I Would do it yeah it's just a simple injection we would find out if there were torn muscles in which ones they were torn after doing orthopedic neurological exam\nUm being a sideline Dr semi pro football team for many years I've seen a few shoulder injuries and so it is fairly easy to figure that out but I don't have X ray vision so I Would refer out for like I said the MRI okay I'm outside of that\nBasically it's too it's a two weeks of just activities of daily living then you'll do some sterile van\nLoad jak rehab at home okay I Do need to see it three times a week like a physical therapist and that's not that's not necessary most people are pretty smart when I'm going to get them as we just got me down you\nKnow and just make sure that we are yeah I like that yeah [laughter] we all understand what we're saying your doctors and nurses we can talk right over people [laughter] so no most of the stuff is pretty simple and easy it's relatively inexpensive especially when we're talking about for robberies jaguars ...\nAnd I had a call why you guys are talking and on this is about probably but many people are thinking as they're listening to all of that stature frost I Know I did um we all talk about\nGosh 'cause I Know what surgery costs for talking if I don't have insurance up to a hundred of thousands of dollars absolutely and by seeing you I'm On it just really a sure everybody\nDoes it we're not talking hundreds of thousands of dollars no no no can you give us kind of like a fall apart because that's what we all kind of want to know and I know we're not going to hold you to lake but what are we talking here as far as the caller\nSeveral thousand dollars okay yeah yeah um and it just depends on what your problems are so you know an e mail only required this but if the new shows up some other\nThings right or tissues and that that does it cost more because the dishes expensive yeah I mean you know we're talking about em the autistic coming from the centers and have to be taken from a you know this is scheduled civilian section so you know they have to go through the FDA process and they have it has to cost something for the questioning they have to do the blood work up to make sure there's no pathogens going and\nThen the ATV the American association of tissue bank\nUm they are trained for this a train than a person that\nUsed a skeptic techniques to process is going from a sterile environment for the section into a sterile environment got it and then it has to be washed it has to be you know shift it has to be and these are all done by medical personnel and or train staff that are certified to handle this with precision and an advocacy\nAnd so that all goes in and some fortunately it's a little expensive but let me tell you something how valuable as your shoulder\nExactly you can't really put a value on saints\nI mean you know we're talking about em the autistic coming from a sensitive than have to be taken from a you know this is scheduled civilian section so you know they have to go through the FDA process and they have it has to cost something for the questioning they have to do the blood work up to make sure there's no pathogens going and then the ATV the American association of tissue bank\nUm they are trained for this plane persons that\nUse a skeptic techniques to process is going from a sterile environment for the section into a sterile environment got it and then has to be washed it has to be you know shift it has to be and these are all done by medical personnel and or train staff that are certified to handle this with precision and an advocacy\nAnd so that all goes in and some fortunately it's a little expensive but let me tell you something how valuable as your shoulder\nExactly you can't really put a value on St Jamie How old is your shoulder pay anything for no pain [laughter] very valuable okay fair I mean you can't use your arm I couldn't use my arm I mean it was scary\nYeah yeah ... and and you can't put a price on fear right you can't do that and it's ... and not just physically but mentally and it puts you in a state you\nKnow what I Want us to really come back down to it's affordable Oh absolutely it's it's yeah they might not it is that it's not affordable you've got it is a very affordable I mean if you look at it over twelve month Perrier an Eighteen month period if some payments and stuff you know what it's worth it\nYou know for two hundred dollars a month you know for a payment plan or something like that that you put yourself on yeah it's when I'm just I'm sure you\nKnow we have ways that you can get them out at a at a zero percent right is\nThat we're not talking hundreds of thousands of dollars that you have to mortgage your house is don't end up selling my jaguar [laughter] or\nMight say that one for you [laughter]\nBut I don't know they wreck yeah so it just so if you really you can't really put a value no no no no but I just want to put ... to tell our listeners to you know you got to look at it too is you know quit going out to movies and now to eat and all of that you know and put your money back into your body into your house well\nAnd and you know that's I Want to lighten up a little bit on that you know how about we just cut down going to the movies and cut down on living and going out in the eating but I'm just using that as an example of a hundred percent yeah absolutely\nAnd I'm you know that's the thing is where are your priorities how fast you want to get better you know and how how much do you not want to work okay nobody really wants to work on thinking but [laughter]\nHopefully everybody's retired and we're not however what I Want to say is there is a guy who I really wanted to call in the day and and I don't know what happened I was looking forward to hearing from so I'm going to tell his story\nOK his name is Ken mhm he came to me a couple of years ago and he had two surgeries on one shoulder\nAnd he had three torn rotator cuff muscles not complete chairs 'cause he would have had to have another surgery if that was the case he had degenerative arthritis in the joints where the shoulder bone actually is and then on top where there is what's it called a sea join your generation their\nVotes shoulders absolutely debilitating\nThe man was fifty two years old what did he do for a living he did nothing for sixteen years prior oh boy he was out of work oh he was struggling in all areas of his life mhm\nHe actually worked for a large company throughout the world and he worked in the automotive area and so he was handling heavy tires region overhead oil changes stuff like that could not do any of it\nAnd we were able to help him with the tissue and I believe it was about three months later he was back to full work doing anything he wanted throwing tires changing how Good Wife whatever it is and he he could do anything and that was about two years ago he and I still keep in touch wow\nJoin your generation their votes shoulders absolutely debilitating the man was fifty two years old what'd you do for a living he did nothing for sixteen years prior oh boy he was out of work oh he was struggling in all areas of his life mhm\nHe actually worked for a large company throughout the world and he worked in the automotive area and so he was handling heavy tires region overhead oil changes stuff like that could not do any of it\nAnd we were able to help him with the tissue\nAnd I believe it was about three months later he was back to full work doing anything he wanted throwing tires changing how Good Wife whatever it is and he he could do anything and that was about two years ago he and I still keep in touch wow and is absolutely amazing what this can do so we talk about\nCost mhm what does that cost him sixteen years of inactivity possibly finances you know we started out that up and\nI'm Sorry I just I just have to ask you when you come in and I will ask you how bad do you want to get better if this is the right solution for you and we talk about time and we'll see if you can put the timing and then we'll talk about cause I'm very transparent everything's in right into my office and you get to decide what you want to do um I just want to educate you\nAfter examining you and give you the solutions and allow you the freedom to make the choice of what you'd like to do look if you want to do surgery I'm sure not going to try and prevent you from doing that this is this is our choice and I want you to have that opportunity to\nSay no I don't have to do surgery or I'd rather try not to do surgery like my eighty one year old patient who is now almost\nOut of paying with bone on board and I hope it stays that way of course but uh yeah of course what's what's the cost Jamie I mean I I Can't imagine being as young as you are and having to go through that and not be able to go water skiing or whatever it is you enjoy doing in Alabama with the\nL L I couldn't pick up my kids like grocery shopping was hard um it was yes it was very difficult I really wish they would've known about this and and gone a different route\nYeah and this is the opportunity to be able to go a different route one possible um and this is what we would offer people get out of pain get off of the opiates get back to work hug

vomiting\nNumbness in extremities and problems in speaking at a certain people in worst case scenario is blindness strokes and even death can result unfortunately because there are multiple there are multiple causes of migraines and multiple possible treatments preventing and treating migrants may take some detective work as well as some trial and error approaches to treatment\nThe good news is that in many cases drastic reductions in their frequency and even permanent prevention\nMay be possible since migraines a billions to medical expenses yearly not including lost productivity in the workplace getting a good diagnosis improper treatment is definitely worth while\nWhile the various prescriptions a prescription medications are available there often accompanied by undesirable side effects and are not completely effective they are actually over twenty causes of migrants that have been determined and that could be food allergies nutrient efficiencies chemical sensitivities\nHormonal imbalances which we've talked about on the show with estrogen dominance and ... and the insects says pesticides and the meat to all that stuff hypoglycemia and even deed hydrate dehydration so a lot of different different issues some of the foods that can cause problems in migraines ah or things such as sweet\nCorn dairy and eggs a magnesium is often a deficient nutrient with migraine so that's one thing they might want to consider and that's where a good multi comes into play because having not adequate amount of magnesium is really key and there are USDA studies that have been done showing there's severe\nMagnesium deficiency in our soils and since your body does not produce that\nThat's very important to get adequate magnesium and says supplementing becomes a big a\nBig issue or chemicals that can provoke migraines include MSG mano sodium glutamate a common preservative want to avoid that are also a flavor an answer I aspartame which we talked about and melodies segment 'em and you know not just aspartame but\nSue Grillo ASL so fame K. that's also called ace Kay all those things can be problematic in relation to migraines a nitrates that's often founded pork products like bacon\nSausage nitrogen nitrate not thinking you know is that at whole foods they have healthy bake and that is nitrate and nitrate free\nAnd nitrogen nitrates also inhibits\nOxygen flow and your body and since I like to do cardiovascular fitness to run by do things like that I don't want any of those things because that can be very problematic because you want to get more than enough oxygen and I don't want anything to restrict my oxygen flow\nYou know so again I appreciate some things whole foods does and with a bake and that's a that's a biggie 'cause I don't want to give that up either\nI'm also Tyrone means which is an amino acids found in chocolate and cheese those can be problematic so just chocolate and she's alone because they naturally contain timing can be problematic some people feel sulfites ah\nCan cause headaches or but this is controversial sulfites a occur naturally in some foods they're also found in winds are often times so that's where I get a drink ah you know sort of a natural wind salt\nAnd nitrates free and nitrogen nitrates also inhibits oxygen flow in your body and since I like to do cardiovascular fitness to run by do things like that I don't want any of those things because that can be very problematic because you want to get more than enough oxygen and I don't want anything to restrict my oxygen\nFlow you know so again I appreciate some things whole foods does and with the baking that's a that's a biggie 'cause I don't want to give that up either\nI'm also tire means which is an amino acid found in chocolate and cheese those can be problematic so just chocolate and she's alone because they naturally contain charming can be problematic some people feel sulfites\nCan cause headaches or but this is controversial sulfites a occur naturally in some foods they're also found in winds are often times so that's where I get a drink ah you know sort of a natural wind sulfites are hard to avoid but that's all this now should\nBe yeah should be avoided we have friends that they do some natural\nLike their Italian and why and how they think of themselves and there's no nitrates than not they were big wine drinkers but it was like wow that's cool I've and wind that system nitrate or a ... sorry it's great um hormonal imbalances or more prevalent and women and may involve estrogen or protests are on\nWomen should pay attention to the timing of migrants relating to their menstrual cycles hypoglycemia excessively low blood sugar can be remedied by eating frequent some small meals\nDehydration can obviously be fixed by drinking more water so those are just some of the issues surrounding migraine but\nIt is a very a broad issue and as it needed said there's some detective work that I Need to be done but all those things can relate to migrants to the bottom line is you just in our house we try and avoid nitrate tonight tries to be we don't\nWe don't really drink so we don't get ... you know we try and eat a limit our simple sugar intake you know you just you know and and the chocolate and cheese there are Jesus or don't have as many tiring means but you know in our house we\nTold them look aged cheddar because it has very low lactose there are things you can do practically to sort of hedge so you don't get migraine but anyway all that to say there's a there's a lot of things that can be involved with migraines so you just want to do what you can\nNow all this than the food they the wine and cheese and the chocolate and the bacon so\nYeah right well [laughter] ... I might I might get one of those rude comments a laugh or not I don't know admiring that you might be a lot sadder now [laughter] anyway um\nSo are we also want to do are getting to know you segments of the I'm going to kick it over to you for bringing that to the forefront\nAll right so this week's code forgetting nail you is the word winner\nW. I. N. N. E. R. and I've spent a loser so it certainly is well and day in regards to that we're going to have you trained gas to had a relative he'll always helps them to win and if you had a relative\nWho was always winning\nSo your point is who had a relative that was sort of helping them cheat to win is that your point exactly it's kind of harsh\n[laughter] anyway well we'll let you know more at the end and that you can let that sim or in the end somewhere between now and the end of the show\nAnyway as we both have some fun little stories to share as far as winter goes W. I. N. N. E. R. that'll be the credit for this week but right on in too hyper thyroid as I'm Rick I Know there's some great information here that you've got to share with everybody\nYes and a lot of this information actually we've gotten from Dr ... 'cause you know he has a clinic as he mentioned he sees patients to suffer from hyper thyroid ism and hyper thyroid ism can I can actually be what's known as graves disease so when your thyroid is over active and people just\nWho was always winning so your point is who had a relative that was sort of helping them cheat to win is that your point exactly [laughter] it's kind of harsh\n[laughter] anyway well we'll let you know more at the end and that you can let that sim or in the end somewhere between now and the end of the show\nAnyway as we both have some fun little stories to share as far as winter ... and any I that'll be the credit for this week but right on in too hyper thyroid as him right now there's some great information here that you've got to share with everybody\nYes and a lot of this information actually we've gotten from Dr ... 'cause you know he has a clinic as he mentioned he sees patients to suffer from hyper thyroid ism\nAnd hyper thyroid ism can I can actually be what's known as graves disease so when you're a sigh rate is over active and people that suffer from hyper thyroid ism or graves disease are often very thin\nBecause when you're a thyroid is over active you're going to have a very high metabolism and that's not necessary problem for some people sometimes I Wish I was a little more hyper thyroid but\nNot that I'm really overweight but I live yeah I've you know you always kind of fighting that battle a little bit so but for people that have it it goes far beyond that and not just being thin but you can be muscle weakness and you know\nTremors and all kinds of problems which will get into later but anyway um basically I Want to read a suddenly doctors fingers written on hyper thyroid isn't just for your information so this condition occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones known as\nIraq than T for and I I oh thigh ruining T. three since I read hormones increase the metabolism self ah one can experience many symptoms relating to high metabolism these include\nIrregular heartbeat nervousness sudden weight loss insomnia and rapid heartbeat so there you have there is some basic things that\nAre obviously not comfortable for a lot of people irregular heartbeat can be\nVery concerning uh the most common cause is an autoimmune condition known as graves disease this condition is more common and women over the age of twenty as the immune system attacks the thyroid gland it stimulates the release of an anti body known as ... wrote trope in receptor anti body or T. R. A. B.\nWhich causes the thyroid to make excessive amounts of thyroid hormones conventional therapy offers three main treatment options anti thyroid medications that you press the production of thyroid hormones\nRadioactive iodine which destroys the thyroid gland and surgical removal of the thyroid and I don't know about you guys but none of those sound like particularly\nA a good options now now not yeah those who receive radioactive iodine or surgery will develop hypo thyroid isn't in the last I write activity which that requires thyroid hormone supplementation for the rest of their lives so I had a girlfriend that's in that position\nAnd this is just so in my mind just so wrong and it just again we mentioned not all drugs are bad but you've got to be very judicious and break careful when you take drugs because the drug companies are not in the business to\nFix or cure your problem there in the business of selling products in the way they do that is by managing helping you to manage your symptoms so they say oh here we're getting is radioactive die or a iodine which will go into your thyroid\nAnd it will kill your thyroid and then oh now you've got loads already had high thyroid now you got low third so now we need to give you a sense right for the rest of your life you know we say make money on so\nThere are better solutions and we're going to go with some of those on the show but we want to make sure that you look at the\nNatural alternatives first we're not advocating every taking drugs were saying certainly will take the natural approach\nAnd this is just so in my mind just so wrong and just again we've mentioned not all drugs are bad but you've got to be very judicious in very careful when you take drugs because the drug companies are not in the business to\nFix or cure your problem there in the business of selling products in the way they do that is by managing helping you to manage your symptoms so they say oh here we're getting this radioactive star\nOr a iodine which will go into your thyroid and it will kill your thyroid and then oh now you've got a lot of hype I right now you got low third so now we need to give you a sense right for the rest of your life you know we say make money on so\nThere are better solutions and we're going to go over some of those on the show but we want to make sure that you look at the\nNatural alternatives first\nWe're not advocating every taking drugs were saying certainly will take the natural approach first see if it's going to work for you and then look at drugs if you have to um so hyper thyroid as I'm concerned as the river solely with natural therapy when\nIt's treated in the early stages the root causes of the auto immune response such a stress\nHormone imbalance chronic infections are gluten allergy must be identified and treated otherwise natural therapies can be integrated with anthrax I read medications such as a method a maze all to maintain a better thyroid doubt so even if you take drugs you can balance it out with a natural therapy so you don't have to take such high dosages by\nField so the rise of barley the wheat fields are quite often very close to the field so that's why there can be concerned about gluten contamination and oats I'm also Casey and free a diet so a diet free is cow's milk and you can also avoid artificial dyes coloring sweeteners and simple\nYes and you know going back to your testing techniques um that's one of the things you you might be getting the sense that this hyper thyroid isn't it's not something generally that you can go into health food store and say oh I Need yourself meant for hyper thyroid at them in fact we do not have a supplement that can really\nEffectively deal with this issue is a it's a very comprehensive approach to you have to take with it and when he talked about this testing techniques those are things that are done in a medical clinic so this is where we would encourage people\nOr you know the ... Center for integrative medicine down in ... Dr singer is um\nAnd he's not asking us to say this by the way I just you know we're friends and and he does a great job he\nDoes blood work on myself my wife my kids every year um this is the kind of thing where you really do want to go see some sort of integrated doctor that can help you but we are going to give you some practical or things that you might try that might be helpful but I think our recommend\nSince that this hyper thyroid ism is not something generally that you can go on a health food store and say oh I Need yourself meant for hyper thyroid has some effect we do not have a supplement that can really\nEffectively deal with this issue is a\nIt's a very comprehensive approach so you have to take with us and when he talked about this testing technique those are things that are done in a medical clinic so this is where we would encourage people or you know the ... Center for integrative medicine down in ... Dr singer is um\nAnd he's not asking us to say this by the way I just you know we're friends and and he does a great job he does blood work on myself my wife my kids every year um this is the kind of thing where you really do want to go see some sort of\nIntegrated doctor that can help you but we are going to give you some practical or things that you might try that might be helpful but I think our recommendation it'd be to be more comprehensive and your approach\nWell and one of the things that is it's sad I\nIs that a lot of regular MDs do not\nLook at the blood work in the same way they don't do the same kind of comprehensive panels that natural politic\nMedical physician like Dr ... so you know yes we encourage if you're near Dr ... go visit his clinic and or find a good natural path in your area and natural Catholic and medical doctor because you're going to get more and you're going to get a more comprehensive evaluation that will really help determine what you need to\nYour issues right that's that's really important so anyway ah without we wanted to talk about a few supplements that there there is some research on and things that might help uh there's one a homeopathic a product out there are so many paths like I owe them I owed ... am\nAnd uh it's been recommended to take to palate of\nThirty see potency three times daily for five days or to tell us of a two hundred see one time only so this might not be something that's easy to find but this is the first recommendation that Dr singer houses that homeopathic I owe them so again\nTo tell us of eight thirty see potency three times daily for five days or two ... two hundred and see one time only so and then you know\nYou see if there's an improvement if there isn't than ah than do not repeat treatments best centers supervision about how many the path a practitioner says but then also sending more simple as a ... that's a view G L E a weed bugle we take to middle leaders three times daily bugle we contains organic acids\nThat are believed to inhibit antibody binding to the thyroid gland so that's\nThat's something I I don't know if you'll find that in helping or not you may have to look on the Internet but that would be a teacher so bugle weed\nAnd then carnitine this is something you can find any health food store and interestingly there was a study in the journal of Andrew cannot endocrinology and metabolism and it found that out carnitine supplementation significantly alleviate symptoms associated with hyper thyroid ism\nThe randomized double blind placebo controlled six month trial involved fifty women\nThe research has found that two thousand four thousand milligrams daily of oral L carnitine was able to relieve many symptoms associated with hyper thyroid as I read his him without any toxicity or medication or interaction and that that's really key so if you're on medication you can take this and based on this study\nThere were no issues so it would also help to reduce elevated liver enzymes so relatively inexpensive he lives in ... healthy it's ... it is and there's different types of carnitine in by carnitine HDL or carnitine tar trait\nIs one that's more stable the other kind of cartoons are very high ... which means they suck moisture out of the air and then the castles tend to stick together\nIf it can only alleviate symptoms associated with hyper thyroid isn't\nThe randomized double blind placebo controlled six month trial involved fifty women\nThe research has found that two thousand four thousand milligrams daily of oral L carnitine was able to relieve many symptoms associated with hyper thyroid as I read his him without any talks a CD or medication or interaction and that's actually key so if you're on medication you can take this and based on this study\nThere were no issues so it also helps to reduce elevated liver enzymes so relatively inexpensive too isn't it ... it is and there's different types of carnitine in by carnitine HDL a carnitine tar trade\nIs one that's more stable the other kind of cartoons are very high ... which means they suck moisture out of the air and then the castles tend to stick together so carnitine tar trade is very very uh it's a good form of carnitine a so any way you want to make sure on label it's the elemental carnitine should say carnitine on this submarine facts\nThen in parentheses that you'd say tar trade if it just says carnitine charging no prints he's\nIt's only a sixty seven percent strength material so if it says a thousand milligrams you only getting six hundred and Seventy milligrams of L carnitine so if it's in France sees than they have to\nDo in the manufacturing process they have to adjust to make sure you're getting the dosing if pure pure carnitine and then\nYou know but that's that's how it's done on the label so if it's in parentheses with carnitine with minerals that's in your game the actual elemental amount of the active so what you should do is take a thousand milligrams two to four times daily uh so that's that's really key so L carnitine and uh we're almost out of time so when we come back\nWe're going to be talking about a few other prescription that can help and then we want to spend a little bit of time I want to talk about something called ... therapy this is something that I've done personally it's

college you\nAt this year's meeting nearly forty thousand attendees gather to discuss the growing body of data on advance difficult to treat diseases that do not have many treatment options\nAnd you know ... by a pharmaceutical company dedicated to improving health and health related quality of life\nFor patients with cancer auto immune and other serious diseases in our interview we speak to a doctor he'll about some of the exciting developments that are taking place at this year's meeting including some of the data that his company presented about advancements in the development of targeted anti cancer drugs such as anti buddy drug conjugate\nTraditional chemotherapy often feels who treated ... forms of cancer because well chemotherapy disrupt tumors it also harms other healthy cells in turn this makes it difficult to deliver potent anti cancer drugs without costing too much harm to healthy cells\nAntibody drug called ... which also known as a de Cheech and the other hand are a form of targeted anti cancer drugs that are able to target the tumor cells both sparing healthy cells these means that more of an anti cancer drug can be delivered to the humor with less side effects\nHowever developing successful antibody drug ... has remained a challenge for several decades and to date only four different forms of ... which have been approved for the treatment of various forms of cancer as\nWe speak reductive peel about some of the latest data pretended about a first in ... drug and how ... can be used for the treatment of advanced or make a study triple negative breast cancer\nCancer's the most common tumor type worldwide intend to twenty percent of breast cancers or what it's called triple negative breast cancer\nAnd the type of cancer the tumor itself lack the expression or amplification of targeting all biomarkers such as receptors for estrogen project throat and human ... growth factor receptive to also known as her too\nBecause in the type of cancer the cancer does not have the most common types of receptors known to field I'm a cancer growth common treatments like hormone therapy and drugs that target estrogen project shown and hurt you or ineffective hence the name triple negative\nUdall chemotherapy to treat triple negative breast cancer it's still an effective option intact triple negative breast cancer may respond even better to chemotherapy in the early stages and many other\nEvents are meant to study triple negative breast cancer\nCancer's the most common tumor type worldwide intend to twenty percent of breast cancers or

common treatments like hormone therapy and drugs that target estrogen projects Joan and hurt you or ineffective hence the name triple negative\nUsing chemotherapy to treat triple negative breast cancer it's still an effective option intact triple negative breast cancer may respond even better to chemotherapy in earlier stages and many other forms of cancer but this type of cancer is extremely hard to treat and generally has a poor prognosis\nAs many as fifty percent of patients diagnosed with early stage triple negative breast cancer that stages one two three experience disease occurrence and thirty seven percent of patients die in the first five years after surgery\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back the younger she burns and if you're just joining us we're talking with Dr Michael ...\nOf immediate medics about some of the exciting news and that strikes presented at at twenty Eighteen annual meeting of the American society of Clinical Oncology ethical which took like June first to fear in Chicago Illinois\nThe team of this year's meeting it's delivering discoveries expending to reach of proceeds should medicine let's go back to the program so\nIn in the spending that kind of drug addict and an anti drug ... being able to hear being very targeted ...\nIf you look at a payload to being used to teach more or less a traditional chemotherapy drug ... uh but it's also used in different ... right and it also using different I'm not in a form of navy she um each being used in different treatments\nIs that the mother compound right and the mother compound it's actually metabolized and deliver it to the ... which is that since fifty eight right\nA lot of the top of night about a a part of this transformation from during the peak on to a sense that he ate a responsible for that took the city so if you're working with the active metabolize you already have an advantage\nIt's an fifty eight by itself it's not easy to use because it's it's not very soluble ... short lived so the ...\nWe're being very targeted [noise]\nIf you look at ... or the payload ... being used to teach more or less a traditional chemotherapy drug ... but it's also used in different areas ... right and it also using different I'm not in a form of native she um each being used in different treatments\nImmunity can is that the mother compound right and the mother compound it's actually metabolized and deliver to the ... which is ... write\nA lot of the metabolites that are a part of this transformation from Iran which he can to and said he ate a responsible for the toxicity so if you're working with the active metabolize you already have an advantage\nIt's an fifty eight by itself is not easy to use because it's it's not very soluble short lived\nSo the idea was actually really to kind of views that active metabolites and find it to an antibody to make it to get labeled make almost like a pro drug exactly to make it stable uh and so and then thirty eight itself is not you know she kind of Jews but comes along with some difficulties\nAnd the ... one inhibits I had a he must have logical toxicity and Guthrie intestinal took to the city\nIt's in thirty eight as a matter of fact when it's bound to the antibody and brought to the to my head so much less side effects so the logical toxicity goes down the gastrointestinal talk to you to go down that you can in Homs the concentration of the active metabolites that the tumor so that's not the whole trickier\nI make making a better drug out or something of that re circulate executive right so ... beyond looking at is the drugs are being used in a in a very difficult to treat each a triple negative press cancer now give me a little bit of a description of triple negative breast cancer and white issue of difficult to treat\nAnd it really comes with the word triple negative because it's got a lot of the program that have been made in the past decade in Britain concept comes through targeted therapies\nAgainst her too which is an antigen uh um and then you can use an antibody against it or against a hormone receptors ... you can you set up against\nUh the problem of triple negative press conference it's not expressing these uh antigens so you can't use targeted therapy [noise]\nUm now what our drug it's done and I think that's the first that put the company has been figuring out to say is actually a an antigen on on vulture for like a different kinds of self that you can use photography and that's a\nThat's a big fit I'm due to the fact that there is no targeted therapies available are the only available therapy for these patients is chemotherapy\nAnd when patients are in the mid Atlantic state and when they saw one or two chemotherapies be fun to have a very bad prognosis\nVery little response rates very low duration of responds and and that's the direction of response to the weeks that you're talking about it like a and actually when you're thinking about the overall survival each patient prognosis like an acute leukemia patients\nIt's probably fair way to to think about it if you are an advancement that's probably true but it could have spent concept patient your prognosis is as bad as a patient with a male\nOr a ... truck has been approved for these patients and we ... have been a running a studies in both patients and payment coming up with data and also data that we've been using for mission that show very good response rate\nLoan generational for his bones for those patients and that's very good uh I'm told her ability prefer that book up to the basis for a mission to actually until you're\nTalking about the mission um there's a presentation hear an echo that Britain ... about another\nRight a and actually when you're thinking about the overall survival each patient prognosis like an acute leukemia patients it's probably fair way to to think about it if you are an advancement of traffic trip and it could have spent concept patient your prognosis is as bad as a patient with him out\nI'm known truck has been approved for these patients and we ... have been a running a study in both patients and came and coming up with data and also data that we've been using for the mission that show very good response rate\nLoan generational for his bones for those patients and that's very good uh I'm told her ability prefer that puts up to the basis for a mission that actually until you're\nNot talking about the mission um there's a presentation hear an echo\nThat Britain ... about another very important group of patients which are expressing the homeowner is it that so called H O e a positive mentality let's come to patients\nThese patients are usually starting when they made a study with home on Saturday or the home on set up you know these days combined with a with the kitty for six inhibitors\nAre to decay for ... and you have a have not the John forgive enter and neighborhoods but then the the hormone therapy come to an end and patients are progressing and then the most out of ...\nUsually these patients get onto cycling or they get a kind of one line of type of thing but if patients undergo hormone therapy out CKY and one nine of chemo that broke noted is as bad as it is for the patients were tripping negative comments consent\nAnd that's where we are actually very excited and keeping a lead into also when we're looking at our data we have response rates above Seventy percent\nUm compared to the usual low teens that you get with chemotherapy in that setting and we will certainly talk to more also about the situation on the progression free survival of the space in which we again feel it's a it's a great segue and the starting point for people to Johnny Depp you want to take\nLike now I Want to circle back a little bit to triple negative breast cancer and into kind of patients that are suffering from the ... particular regrets if they teach 'em tell me a little bit about the patient population\nYeah that was trying to say I'm at the starting point is is we all um and knowing patience with breast cancer ... many of our um no these patients into\nA family and and write and friends and and\nBreast cancer patients on not all the same and when you're talking to a patient with triple negative spreads concept um their feel is that there are a neglected group of patients because all the progress that had been made with all these new drugs and all the approval of is enough progress that they have been experiencing and and\nDaddy it's much more aggressive biologically they have a very different paths enough metastases very often they have brain metastases for example\nAnd ... percent of the organs as compared to bone metastases that's with other patients with bread crumbs I mean\nI have a much higher risk of relapse after the initial therapy so the whole biology it's different prognosis it's much worse like an acute leukemia patients and there's no drug debatable patients so it's actually really an eclectic group of patients\nUh and it's not a small group it's round about ten to Fifteen Percent of all the patients uh with mental study breast cancer and we have very very happy and fortunate to finally hopefully bring program at least ...\nRight [noise] um no\nSome subject matter that may\nDaddy the it's much more aggressive ... they have a very different paths enough metastases very often they have brain metastases for example\nAnd metastases of the organs as compared to bone metastases with other patients with bread crumbs I hadn't\nI have a much higher risk of relapse after the initial therapy so the whole biology it's different the prognosis it's much worse like an acute leukemia patients and there's no drug debatable ... patients so it's actually really an eclectic group of patients\nUh and it's not a small group it's round about ten to Fifteen Percent of all the patients uh with metal study breast cancer and we have very very happy and fortunate to finally hopefully\nBring program at least ... right [noise] um no\nSome subject matter to me I'm\nNot necessarily dealing with your company a but more in a broader scope of I'm asked co um some of the treatment options that are out there\nYou being here now for a maybe a day maybe a little bit longer or looking at some of the advantage in in in clinical development in in in college you um\nOther than the very great news that you're actually bringing for a very specific patient population what are some of the things that\nExcites you outside of this area\nI think it's a great point then it stops within that tangible but it's increasingly good understanding in deep understanding of the biology of the diseases that we are dealing with mhm\nThat's actually an area where although we are in a small company we're investing loss that go on the spending the biology of all taught at the impact that it has a in predictive terms and put them in ... not to come up just as a target\nUm relapse patterns of those patients I'm I think the bases of making the real step forward for all of those indications are that you get a good it's this very thorough and deep understanding of not just a target than the biology of the disease and that's exactly what we try to do to do the next step\nAnd that that's certainly a lot of exciting data here in the areas that are interesting for us with checkpoint inhibitors ...\nBut we want to figure out a together with other companies is to identify the exact patient population a defining molecularly\nUm that then gets the right to come in a total approach in order to improve that prognosis so what always excites me when they come to these meetings if the\nProgress in the acceleration of the understanding of the biology ... and we absolutely a and will be part of this and that allows it to them very targeted\nSelect the right come into the approach that we're going to go together with our cynical partnerships that people do let's take a short break here\nBoth [noise]\nMost of us like at the time that fight sunscreen and other safety measures are key to bring your skin and aging and can't be happy I recommend anything is frame of the\nHere\n\nMost of us like to be out in the sun that's my sunscreen and other safety measures are key to protecting your skin and aging in cancer the FDA recommends using a sunscreen with the sun protection factor\nEvery development in every approval off a truck I think comes along with the need for very thorough a side effect management of patients because by the patient that you're seeing in the real life maybe older maybe more fragile or maybe have maybe have more commodities\nAnd the worst thing that can happen is a drug like out in the hands of someone with not being totally educated but I ... through literature and that round thing we absolutely want to make sure we put a lot of effort into it and the second answer that wants to give it that way when we're thinking outside of the U.S\nA lot of the and you're coming from a country of rare reimbursement a and the economic benefits actually tied to um showing the value in real life population actually so we are in the situation where we have to come up\nA bridge the data for the ... population very very early on that's great way to do it on now that data sets available that were not available for five to ten years ago\nBut if you even think about getting reimbursement in Europe and that's something that we absolutely want to do and if you think about having successful discussions also with pay us here in the U.S [noise] you have to come up a with real life data\nI think that's a natural sequence of things here are the company you start with you a pivotal study or you want to make sure that as we've been discussing you come up with a ride\nUm life cycle plan and coming a thorough approach it according to the in ... understanding of the study but I'm very thankful that you say that they said it's very important element which is\nA value proposition in abroad population and the ability to show and show can stop in a in a meaningful way and that's exactly what's on next step is going to look like\nThat combined with a very thorough education on ah the profile of the drugs that side effects of the drugs but then also how to treat and prevent side effects we we're going to take this very very very serious every patient that you're losing suicide effect for me it's a tragedy\nRight and that brings you also the or the next question to some extent if you look at a clinical trials I'm about\nFour to five percent of 'em are people that actually diagnosed with a particular form of cancer or overall participation in clinical trials each between four and five percent roughly\n[noise] uh the value proposition in abroad population and the ability to show and show 'cause that in a in a meaningful way and that's exactly what's our next step is going to look like\nThat combined with a very thorough education on ah the profile of the drugs that side effects of the drugs but then also how to treat and prevent side effects we we're going to take this very very very serious every patient that you're losing suicide effect for me it's a tragedy\nRight and that brings you also the or the next question to some extent if you look at a clinical trials I'm about\nFour to five percent of 'em are people that actually diagnosed with a particular form of cancer or overall participation in clinical trials it's between four and five percent roughly\nUm how can you you increase the number so there was a study presented either today or tomorrow I'm not sure uh which actually talks about eliminating the inclusion of exclusion correct exclusion criteria what they came up with as a result is that it's may\nUltimately you'll one percent increase in participation in the clinical trial\nI'm all for that clinical trials of those people that actually participate the larger number or white male or female patients I'm and we're not talking about it\nA lot of people that are either black or Hispanic and then you had so in order to get a better ID or functioning about boats boats clinical trials how can we include or\nIncreased the number of patients are participating political trials at the same time maybe increase the number off of blacks and Hispanics that might increase in in in that particular way\nCouldn't agree more and and and that is\nThat that has always been an issue and it's unfortunately it's still is an issue um days by the way indications that up doing slightly better than other indications um and we should learn from them when we were looking at some of the logical malignancy is um\nI Would make an argument that the proportion of patients going into those studies and significantly higher\nSo I think as a starting point I'm trying to learn from each other a and and see what other uh doing well enough to well it's a it's a great starting point number one\nNumber two is is I think that an obligation of communication um to start with um when it comes to clinical study not just in clinical trials that go off to the patient organizations and using all the wonderful in that case wonderful new media opportunities that you're having\nAnd having a credible communication with keg events and patients so that they understand the value a and the purpose of a clinical study and how they can profit from that\nI think the sad thing and we've been touching upon that I I\nI personally believe that that you could probably position at at participation in clinical studies I Would say like the ability to document the sick and see and I'm the benefit written profile of a drug\nUm throughout and not trust during a pivotal studies or in phase one foot face to face three but throughout back to that kind of this notion of we want to have\nReal life data in order to learn how whether we are doing\nAnd how we how we can improve upon where we'd given the drunk how were given the drunk and how we do many side effects that's a very important part of it and and I think that's something where we as an industry can certainly do much better I can assure you that this is something that we're going to do\nA lot right or if you bring a ... like our\nI personally believe that that you could put the position that participation in clinical studies I Would say like the ability to document the tickets to see and I'm the benefit written profile of a drug\nUm throughout and not just during pivotal studies or in phase one for it to a phase three but throughout back to kind of this notion of we want to have\nReal life data in order to learn how whether we are doing and how we how we can improve upon where we'd given the drug how were given the drunk and how we doing side effect that's a very important part of it\nAnd and I think that's something where we as an industry can certainly do much better I can assure you that this is something that we're going to do a lot right or if you bring a drug like our into late land populations\nYou want to understand how patients are doing you want to have metrics and being able to measure whether the side effects recommendations that you're giving a working or are not working right\nAnd so that's another area where we are going to put a lot of efforts in because we feel everybody's profiting from federal documentation and review of how the drug doing are we doing well other physicians doing well and then ultimately of course that leads to the question is pay our patients doing well now\nThat means for example larger population based studies maybe ... or ... or observational ...\nAnd ... and I think that's that way though you can do it and it's also a wonderful way to know of at the turn of data capture them and I I think that's multiple weights and we're all going all of them\nLet's take a short break if you're just joining us we're speaking with

when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident and I said\n... you have a little tiny house how could your purview however bilby so high I said there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and heart goes from ATF and the third piece because atheists mentor people had some news or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nUm I used you know gee there's lots of people out there that can make hamburger okay I'm up at these things but there's only one that has the secret sauce now\nSecret sauce is making sure that you have the right amount of panels with smart energy management let me talk about that would see on our built this thing called demanded a lot of people an atheist this year seen this\nNew charge on their bill called demand and it's a number of like maybe ... team point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just day regular one two three and\nAnd what that is is a PS created these amazing rape plans selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hottest I'm of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopolies are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest today oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of ...\nThirteen point five four or maybe Nineteen point seven to it could be nine point six it's a strange number it's usually never just stay regular one two three ten\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power of the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hottest I'm of the day between three and have him and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way that the analogy of the people like like that I've been told is remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate will their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends\nThey could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist met her when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars and forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars um it's the power that you've consumed at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester you want to raise\nIs to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\nHere for its criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you and I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay younger ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect\nYou anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go up\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them and I explain all this to them\nSo not only are you paying between seven and a half and eat and have since for your kill a lot on your roof\nYour tax credits paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of the home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your homes Carol and that's the two things I tell people there is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus the electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um it it just it doesn't make sense for them\nThey built in Ukrainian rates everybody should just call you just find out how to read their bill and then I don't know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he'll go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site and I do a rate I'm review and break it down on\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us\nHave been hearing us for a year year and a half and then the natives out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now I understand what she rains and so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simply this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and\nAll the time and say I do a rate I'm review and break it down on [noise]\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now I understand what she runs\nAnd so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol I'm sending people\nOver half off their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS ... today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home we use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid to the power company cut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well here's what we're\nGoing to do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really should just give recall she does a free consultation she's ready to what the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it six to three\nEight five zero eight two two nine she wants you to go up on her website it is asked solar Sandy dot com go to ask makes sure at ... dot com\nFill out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for today you know\nIt's it's the simplest is you know I really am on a mission when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time due to my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life 'cause I financially wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful then she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the than I was able to help them understand my daughter was able to help them understand it\nSo now it's about I'm there to educate\nAnd give people the the information so that they can make an informed decision about their own power costs they wouldn't let somebody else choose their host what kind of payment they could afford for mortgage they wouldn't let somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe since they just haven't got the information yet but let's get Hugh Hugh with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power cause\nShe's valley wide it's no obligation free consultation to you out there she had lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone\nThe number to call her direct it is area code six to three eight five zero eight two two nine go on that website and check out the ... ... feet it's asked sell solar Sandy dot com [noise]\nChoose their house what kind of payment they could afford for market it wouldn't let somebody his car and look how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe they just haven't got the information yeah but let's get you what the right information you can make an informed decision about your ... cheese valley wide it said no obligation free consultation to you out there she has lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone\nThe number to call her direct idiots area code six to three eight five zero eight two nine go on that website and check out the ... where it's asked sell solar Sandy dot com\nSo you're not only producing your own power between seven and eight cents now a PS is buying that extra power back in your roof is potentially ... you're putting your roof to work and you're putting your that you're leaving no money on your roof 'cause that's what my thing\nSo I must say you have a few of them are I must say this you\nKnow if you've heard ... we've said this before\nThe thing about all of this is that there's different information\nAll the time it's new and that's what's so we're standing all about she does all the research for everybody and then she comes and she taught you it's a no obligation free consultation that you go to them if you give them a a two hundred dollar or whatever it is it's a two hundred and fifty dollar settler ultimate settlers that aiding\nAnd sent to help people when you were installed this is to thank you for for working with me\n... I I work for my family's I'm there to do my best work for them [noise] um I'm not a solar company I'm an energy expert and I actually to educate you about how your electric bills work and all these fees and charges and a gestures and people are really seeing these huge\nDifferences in their bills this year and they're going oh my gosh\nWhy because if you didn't choose your rate plan a PS chose it for you and you're seeing a bill that might have been two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars last year as high as five hundred your might you may be seeing a three hundred dollar bill over six seven hundred dollars and people are quite we're not using any more part they might even be using a little bit less\nThis is only going to get worse if you don't figure this out now to produce your own power pay less for it\nAnd and here's another really important point as wise as it was to go solar previous years and I commend all of my family's that worked with me previous years there's the tax is the the federal and state tax credit is available to you most people that's over ten thousand dollars to you\nAnd then the buyback program a PS has it is is is after August thirty first is TB deep to beat the term so if you are going to do some\nChose it for you and you're seeing a build it might have been two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars last year as high as five hundred you might you may be seeing a three hundred dollar bill over six seven hundred dollars and people are quite we're not using any more power they might even be using a little bit less\nThis is only going to get worse if you don't figure this out now to produce your own power pay less for it\nAnd here's another really important point as wise as it was to go solar previous years and I commend all of my family's that worked with me previous years there's the ... the the the federal and state tax credit is available to you most people that's over ten thousand dollars to you\nAnd then the buyback program a PS has to do is is is after August thirty first it's TB deep to beat the tournament so if you are going to do something this is really the time to do it because there's so many benefits and I say to my family is number one benefit is savings you are going to save\nThousands upon thousands of dollars off your power cost and the other is to live more comfortably in your home why should the power company dictate how much power we use and when we use it now between three and eight PM it's the\nPeak demand power a P. S. S. or peace between one in eight so why should the electric company dictate when we are comfortable that's the hardest time of the day when we get home from work wanting to enjoy our homes that we've worked hard for\nAnd another thing the our power claws stuck in your home is our highest expense that will have in our lifetime so why is consumers you you've gone by your house and you know what you can afford you know kind of car you can afford\nYour ... those should be no different producing your own power and paying less for between seven and eight cents per kilowatt is what it works out to being when you work with me I'm going to show you how to produce your own at between ... and put more of your heart or money back in your pocket not the ...\nI have to say to that you have\nBeen doing this for several years it's not like you just turned around and decided to do that you are very\nEducated basically what she's going to do is talk to you a little bit about how even read your power bill wouldn't it be nice to know what it really means and that way when she educates you know you can do make an informed ... ... ... exactly\nCarole and I mean you know I Love when you say people don't really open their ... just going to pick up the right and they go oh we're just going to pay that\nThat shouldn't be the case this is your home you have basically control over what you consume

one that has the secret sauce so be very careful it's not just about solar panels anymore it's about solar panels in the right amount of them\nCombined with the right rate plan and with smart energy management and that's a whole nother charge on your bill that we need to manage people are seeing this charge an ape yes probably for the very first time hold demand\nAnd that is probably some people were going that's more than my power cost combined with these and the taxes but there's a separate charge for demand we managed that and we medicate that and you live more comfortable in your home paying less for your power that phone number to call a six to three\nAnd I'm going to give you a little bit extra and here's the thing there's a there's other companies that know how to make

end\nAnd a lightning spot opened up\nAnd so this is where I met my mentor Mr de Bryan Shaw and she ran shows a name and\nThe opportunity to help a helping the individual do some flooring um I was running a night crew and I just got to the point where I got tired of\nChristmas Night having to go to work and Thanksgiving night having to go to work and kind of live in that whole lifestyle of of a graveyard shift in dealing floor and kind of gave me more of an open opportunity to be able to\nUm have weekends often and and I liked it I liked the working with my hands and I took quite a bit of a pay cut to to get into the industry and learn it and um\nAnd it's just progressed from their eyes open my my ah first installation company in a in the late nineties which was Taylor installs\nA man I installed flooring for Twenty years and went from the last two years that I was installing I had opened a store which is brand Flora\nUm I was running at night crew and I just got to the point where I got tired of\nChristmas Night having to go to work and Thanksgiving nice having to go to work and kind of living that whole lifestyle of of a graveyard shift in dealing flooring kind of gave me more of an open opportunity to be able to\nUm have weekends off in and and I liked it I liked the working with my hands and I took quite a bit of the pay cut to to get into the industry and learn it and um\nAnd it's just progressed from their eyes open my my ah first installation company in a in the late nineties which was Taylor installs I'm\nIn I installed flooring for Twenty years and went from the last two years that I was installing a hit open to store which is brand foreign uh to kind of set up for the retirement it's a pretty hard trade\nNot one that I wanted to be dealing in my fifties and sixties [noise] um and\nSo the ads\nI open the store I kind of face myself out of insulation and now I Am\nJust doing the sales and overseeing the store seizing warriors ... correct and how long is Brandon\nBrandon spin around going on eight years uh from I've been in an industry for twenty five an hour that map doesn't make sense but there was a couple of years were I was doing all the installs out of my own store\nA fan and so there was that they use and correct yeah it was the boss\nAnd and with growth of of of a business you have to start depending on other people and uh so I got to the point where we were having to hire more people and I've just I've just fades my so I have an insult for five years\nSo you know a lot about different kinds of boring yeah tell us a little bit about different kinds of storing iron and\nWhy some are better than others I'm ordering their application yeah so I'm\nWith the knowledge that that I have with with flooring or different types of carpet work better for different types of situations if you have pets or you have high traffic was there's we have carpet settle little will match that and and hold up to let\n'em tiles it's always going to be your most dependable product\nIt's a terrible as long as it's install correctly you don't want to flying off the floor or would we do would be um and land the floors are a little bit more delicate of a product that take care of them a little bit differently than you do any of the others but if you take care of and the last\n... corporate as well as it was hard for\nEverything carpet child would showers yeah we do everything\nIs our number when I first got out here it's like everything's carpet crowded room wall to wall you know\nAnd you know you always have the static electricity yeah you're on certain touching anybody is that\nYou know and of course some people thought that was funny some people thought that was not funny at our act\nSo what are some of the hardest installs that you had personally as while you were installing 'em\nI I Would say more so um some of the ... the ones that we had to go into maybe with\nUm not not necessarily that that's physical but maybe maybe with um a passing that had to go in and in an intake carpet out of a room or something like that\nUm every every job was hard though does it really hard I didn't really look at one being any harder than other whether it's hard furniture or\nCertain touching anybody like that\nAnd of course some people thought that was funny some people thought that was not funny at our ex\nSo what are

back\nQuite significantly now our tax plan it gets rid of them altogether because we know that\nTaxes corporations don't pay the right folks you know that\nYou know the corporations don't pay taxes they don't they just pass it on at the end of the day otherwise they go out of business right they need to get their numbers their quotas and that's what\nThey did so our taxpayer gets rid of corporate tax rates for Trump's have lower them\nLook what's happening since he's learned dump people are getting higher wages people quitting their jobs because they can get better jobs they're

I mean there's really no turning back to haunt me up any choice dot org under a shock you can you know the some of the courses and learn about that kid but\nAbsolutely homey apathy I mean we have had to tie go\nUm she wrote an infection ear infection my daughter had a urinary tract infection she seemed to have inherited a little bit of my weak bladder and ah and time again on the\nLine one infection and I did work with my medical doctor and a professional homeopathy I'm for this situation\nBut my ... my husband actually got stung by a beam and he's not allergic to be but um that the steam turned into the light is pretty down quickly and um\nIt's a it's a tricky thing and and absolutely antibiotics as the first thing that you know doctors will we used to take care of that\nAnd you know of course we we will use antibiotics if we have to if if we're in a you know I called her role like life threatening situation but I'm a you know we we try to kind of addressed it\nRight away from the beginning with homey apathy and at work I mean the infection kind of got pretty\nPretty intense right there at the beginning and then before we knew what he was on the road to recovery and he was better within five days and let's hope youthful about a situation like that\nIs that ... for example take usually a large amount of antibiotics and they tend to come back over and over again the Saudi led section they tend to be very resistant to antibiotics and it was just fantastic to have remedies in my home\nBut I was able to use for my husband um we specifically is della Donna you know it was red hot and robbing his arm and and I can identify a ... situation very quickly when I see that red hot and driving symptoms\nAnd we use that and we use it a couple of other remedies and during the whole course that within five days it was like nothing had ever happened and it's just so wonderful for me as a mother to be able to take care of my family like that\nThat's a beautiful thing about whom he obviously when do you have an acute situation in your home of course traditionally give that pediatrician call you go to the emergency room you have to wait and then it's you're kind of like taking potluck are you going to get somebody who has experience or called but it\nBut the beautiful thing is coming up and say doesn't cause any harm you know if you prescribe ...\nSo it's not the right remedy and you don't see an improvement world anew seek help with a with a professional but some of these situations who her life and especially if you're a mom you know what you want to take care of your kids immediately\nAnd you see them suffering and ah you know time is a factor show why don't reach into your only about the remedy kit and a prescribe a remedy and just to observe the reaction\nOf right you know raising my three kids so mean article was my friend you know when my son just go after bicycling or screaming bloody murder [laughter]\nNow give them a little bit of articles and ah the pain went away and they quickly we're back on the bicycle like like nothing happened and the same thing with a so many colds and flus you know traditional medicine\nAre waiting though was above ... which is humorous because most\nFlus are caused by a virus and every bodies have very little effect but\nYou know what you want to take care of your kids immediately\nAnd you see them suffering and uh you know time is a factor show why don't reach into your only about the remedy kit and a prescribe of a remedy and just to observe the reaction\nOf right and you know raising my three kids so in order to go was my friend the other one of my sons stole Arthur bicycling or screaming bloody murder [laughter] now give them a little bit of articles and ah the pain went away and they quickly we're back on the bicycle like like nothing happened\nAnd the same thing with the so many colds and flus you know traditional medicine all but you know as a bioethics which is humorous because most flus are caused by a virus and if it was a very little effect but to go to the pediatrician or to get a dinner by Arctic\nAnd we asked we actually right now we're living on a broad for two years but we um our home bases in Texas and we have a farm you have enough Kelly have chicken the beans and garden and without no ... I mean she she got ...\nOne and I'm a couple of other infections her calf only castrated because you know\nBold if they're not kept trying to get really dangerous and aggressive [noise]\nUm and you know he got in touch after being captured and which actually it was a happen very often then again\nYou know I work at the that to identify with what's going on how serious it was because he got a kind of be smart about it and no one wants you to be on why they're foolish but my goodness honey apathy with my farm animals it works so well once the correct remedy is selected\nIt works so well that's really about educating yourself you know partnering with a really great homeopathic can be you know your family home my path and you can get out we can avoid a lot of drugs\nWith the with these you know with kind of\nPlanning ahead and preparing yourself and that's what I think monitor so great at right you you look into any mom person they're prepared with a bunch of things in my purse had our neck I like you said for those accidents it has um\nHas lead on a test and act and I and I always carry that wherever I go because on the Applebee's is so fantastic it really truly as mothers medicine in many ways\nYou know I'm I have to ask you this question but for the listeners who may not know what are we up with the is\nYou know I always told by patients\nSometimes it's easier to explain would hold me up with the is ought to what it is\nAnd I think I already touched on the subject at home you up at the is not herbal medicine it's not good nutrition ... diet so I'd exercised show me opposite he is a particular science it's a particular way of treating disease from from the white person's perspective\nUm how do you explain told me opposite each people\nSo I actually have to do this a lot because um because of the Americans for homeopathy choice on we have a lot of opportunities to talk to people on Capitol Hill and absolutely they don't know a lot of hung out if he is and so basically the best way to explain it is it follows the principle\nOf like ... like they call it a lot of similarities in\nInternational medicine they even use us on summers have seen it with vaccines\nWhere you take a small amount of something and it helps\nPrevent or cure or something I'm not advocating for a vaccine but it that's kind of have that last summer's they've also seen this in um\nAllergy treatment where people have allergies they take small doses of that allergen and they build an immunity to it and so when I go on Capitol Hill I compare it to anything that we already know about it for fighting and we're we're generally comfortable with but again not advocating those methods but it's just kind of a point of reference points on hold me up at the moment\nWe take substances that produced\nNow the choice on we have a lot of opportunity to talk to people on Capitol Hill and absolutely they don't know a lot of hung out if he is and so basically the best way to explain it is it follows the principle of like ... like they call it the last similar isn't\nIn conventional medicine they even use us on summers they've seen it with vaccines\nWhere you take a small amount of something and it helps\nPrevent or cure or something I'm not advocating for vaccines but it does kind of have that last summer's have also seen this in um\nAllergy treatment where people have allergies they take small doses of that allergen and they build an immunity to it and so when I go on Capitol Hill I compare it to these things that we already know about us for fighting and we're we're generally comfortable with but again not advocating those methods but it's just kind of a point of reference on homeopathy on\nWe take substances that produce symptoms in their original state and we use them and their diluted states to cure a similar symptoms so\nMy favorite example the example of onion we've all cut an onion my kids want to you know we're we're being ridiculous and they've been into an onion and boy the eyes were watering the nose was running but it wasn't green sick runny nose and it's going to be that egg white clear runny nose I'm burning in the eyes burning in the nose and so\nYou know think of in Illinois that producers do similar symptoms egg white runny nose watery eyes burning I got a cold got you know allergies and so what you do there is\nIf you have those symptoms then you're sick you take the homeopathic form of an onion which is um we use a Latin term right on the ... and that is going to help get it's going to get your body the information that need\nTo address that illness and bring about balance and um and that's that's an important part of our political things that we're doing is homey apathy is not um\nIt is technically listed as a drug in the food drug and cosmetic act in legally technically a drug but that but it has nothing to do with drones dried treat disease homey Augustine\nEmpowers the person to get the right information the body needs the body stuck capture itself\nGives the information that means now it can cure itself you know and and it's it's similar to acupuncture a lot of other natural things you know you ... the the acupuncture needles aren't\nSharing a disease it's bringing down the body for the balance to to kind of get over this block whatever it is and to finalize curing it and so that's all me up at the end of selecting the remedy that have\nThat mimic the disease that you have and the remedy is\nOn and this was a beautiful part the remedies are so diluted and that's one of the criticisms that it's too early to to work well it does work and we've observed is higher than their spouses of clinical trials in papers and studies about how homey up as he can be effective\nAnd and our focus is you know what\nThere's a lot of skeptics hung out to the this like he'll like doesn't make sense and and they don't understand how something that's so diluted down\nThat how it can work but guess what that then that's okay if if someone doesn't think it works and don't buy it don't use it Americans for homeopathy choice the mama bears out homey apathy choice we believe in freedom for us to try something inherently safe before during or after we've tried conventional medicine\nDown how it can work\nI guess what mocked okay if it's some I think it works from don't buy it don't use that Americans for homeopathy choice the monetary hung out to be trained we believe in freedom for us to try hunting inherently safer for during or after we've tried conventional matter\nA robo homeopathic shoe store each homeopathic remedies to go through studies that would destroy the opposite which is ... millions of dollars to get one drug approved and we have probably oh well over a thousand different homeopathic remedies\nThat in the back and you're you're you're hitting the nail on the head right now you think you're right and that's totally right\nAnd and let me give you a little bit of background on why this is happening so in the seventies or you know I I forget my date but I think it was in the seventies you know there is a strategy that came out and it causes all the deformity than women because in babies because women took them while they're pregnant so then the FDA decided okay not only do that because at the\nBeginning Afghans out what to make sure drugs are manufactured correctly that what was on the bottle it's in the bottle and that's how\nThat's how they regulate and everything but then then there's you know\nThis driving cause all these problems on these babies and said OK okay now it needs to be\nSafe and effective and not just manufactured correctly it needs to be also be affected well the problem it's not now they're they've realized oh let me out but he has never been evaluated for ethic as the but the problem is all me apathy has never ever\nIn its entire two hundred years had one documented that their permanent disability associated to it there are no risk with which to offset by active in it and so that's what I'm telling everybody on Capitol Hill I said okay it on a surface it seemed like trying to determine whether\nOr not me out of the effect is effective as a good idea but here's the problem there's two problems like this the first one is\nIt is highly individualized medicine if you have allergies and I have allergies and we both take allium pizza it might help us poker my only help when it all depends on what our symptoms are not my allergies presented with an allergic hawk which it it has an impact\nOn the roof of the mouth and itchy ears AMC by which we just talked about what am I\nAccrued and how my body addressed that illness but if your allergies presented that way it's fine it's after he wants to stay at home you know the the the fact that for allergies in the eye and see or they're not going to come out with positive result because they're using conventional drug model to measure effectiveness\nYou know that's a very in college because I shall patients that I have a healer degeneration what homeopathic remedies should I take I tell them well if I treat a hundred folks with macular degeneration each one may need a different homeopathic remedies 'cause we treat the person\nWe just rent the standard\nAnd send the way that Disney's has impacted than even emotionally all of that is part of the collecting of their enemy that's in that and so when I say this to everybody on\nShe works with the mouth and itchy ears IMC by which we just talked about will not\nApproved and how my body addressed that illness but if your allergies presented that way it's fine it's after he wants to the of homeopathy is effective for allergies in the eye and see if they're not going to come out with positive results because they're using conventional drug model to measure effectiveness\nYou know that's a very in college because I tell patients that I have ... degeneration what homeopathic remedies should I take I tell them well if I treat a hundred folks with macular degeneration each one may need a different homeopathic remedies 'cause we treat the person\nWe just rented their leader\nStanding and send the way that disease has impacted than even emotionally all of that is part of the selecting the remedy Beth and Beth and so when I say this to everybody on Capitol Hill I have to say Ninety nine percent of the staffers I'm Talking with they understand\nThey get it and they don't think that applying assistant of medicine which has conventional drug to a different system of medicine the rules for once just them to the others shouldn't be applied across the board\nThing that we have the problem with effective ... is that it will bankrupt homey apathy homeopathic remedies or natural they can't be patented in the same way drugs can and it costs about eight dollars around money to buy\nWell the reason the chronicle drugs can do the new drug application of because they cost a thousand or one for one remedy a new drug application would cost upwards of millions of dollars if not hundreds of millions of dollars per remedy are\nAre on the low tide it would cost three million for him and that's a very low side and so I'm telling them it will this new drug application first it won't work at that tell me off of the up for failure because it's using the wrong system that that is and and then on the other hand it will bankrupt telling me up at the\nUp with the is bankrupt and our freedom of choice will and will not only about ... available for us and of course the ... gonna be a reason why big pharma is encouraging the FDA to do this to eliminate the competition simply\nThat's exactly right well because think about it I didn't mean to things that I had you know I was diagnosed six years and they'll think about the the amount per per year of drugs\nProcedures and surgeries I would've donated it's our dollars go to the pharmaceutical industry and instead for eight dollars around any a a bottle which lasts me almost a year\nEight dollars I sure did this so called one dollar spent on hold me off the it can be quite to\nThousands of dollars in the pharmaceutical drug\nIndustry and that's the concern and then and then I think the most important thing that we need to see here is that the SPA saying you know they're going to prioritize this risk based approach there they're going to force hold me off the the the new drug application but they're only picking a few category the Romney got for whatever reason they think is dangerous well\nNothing in their draft guidance actually limits them from just focusing on those categories technically their draft guidance says that they can do this at their will to all of ... nothing\nUp

advent\nHad been prophesied in the Old Testament unarmed on such as the place of his birth his death and his resurrection are some of the prophecies pertaining to Christ second visit our second advent now being fulfilled and human experience\nYes very definitely so that Jesus first advent his disciples\nKnowing of the kingdom promises of the Old Testament believe that Christ was set up that king immediately\nBut when they learned that this was not to be that Jesus was going away and returning later to set up his kingdom they ask him what would be the scientific return\nIt was an answer to this question that Jesus describe world tension and fears of today one of these prophecies is a new chapter Twenty one and states that that would be up on the earth distress of nations with perplexed at the\nEnd the men's hearts would fail them for fear as they look ahead to the things coming up on the earth\nWill lap prophecy is true world conditions today there is no doubt as a matter of fact beginning with Nineteen hundred and fourteen up the outbreak of the first World War there has been little else but the stress of nations with perplexed\nAnd that that distress has not decreased with the passing of the year now it is a fear that the entire race might be destroyed\nAnd Jesus foretold I'd also\nIn a prophecy recorded and Matthew the twenty fourth chapter versus Twenty one and twenty two he said that at the time of his second visit to where\nThere would be a period of great tribulation a tribulation so great he said that unless it was brought to an end all flash would be destroyed\nWell that is inaccurate preview of the president world situation\nYou know and I have heard people say that President world conditions are in no way related to prophecy that what is happening is simply a matter of history repeating itself but I Am sure there is nothing and\nNow it is a fear that the entire race might be destroyed\nAnd Jesus foretold that also\nIn a prophecy recorded in Matthew the twenty fourth chapter versus Twenty one and twenty two he said that at the time of his second visit to where\nThere would be a period of great tribulation a tribulation so great he said that unless it was brought to an end all flash would be destroyed\nWell well that is an accurate preview of the president world situation\nYou know and I have heard people say that President world conditions are in no way related to prophecy that what is happening is simply a matter of history repeating itself\nBut I Am sure there is nothing and past history concerning a time when the destruction of all of us was threatened as it is today\nAnd that's very true actually\nThe only difference between what Jesus foretold and what our scientists and Mila terrorists and others are saying today is that Jesus prophesied it nearly two thousand years before the wise in this generation recognize a threatened catastrophe\nWhich should give us confidence in the prophecies of the Bible of cars but add what about tomorrow we'll man actually destroy himself in this time of great tribulation that you referred\nTo know who he won't Jesus foretold up the tribulation would be would be brought to close before that happened the reason is at the time has come for the setting up of the long promised kingdom of Christ\nThe prophecies relating to Christ kingdom are then prophecies that refer to the future refer to tomorrow\nYes and they presented very complete viewpoint of what is in store for the family of man under that new government over which Christ will be the head\nFor instance the profit ... wrote that of the increase of his government and the peace there should be no end\nMeaning that there will be a worldwide and lasting peace eventually\nRight and another prophecy states that the knowledge of the lord shall fill the earth as the water's cover the C\nMeaning the end of all superstitions and create all religious conflicts and persecution at the time will come when they won't exist\nAnd that's right another prophecy tells it then none she'll make them afraid number less them this the notes genuine freedom from fear\nThank God for that kind of like some of the other prophecies of tomorrow I'd like to hear them you know\nRussell even when the world's assured of these blessings we've just mentioned freedom from fear and freedom from war and so forth

may be and they haven't been able to get it on their own so why not it's not economy it's not the weather is nothing any anything but they're thinking right or thinking needs to change because\nIf you keep thinking the same thoughts because you believe the same thing\nYou'll keep doing the same thing you keep getting the same results so think about it if you're always been on that couch guess why you'll always be on the couch until you change your thinking\nAnd that's what we do we get you to change your thinking all of a sudden you become successful you\nKnow yesterday we were talking on and I'm not going to say exactly everything that we were talking about ... I Want to say there's a lot of people think\nThat hit hypnosis is a little weird you know or they think that they don't believe in it or this and that and there's even says something people that just don't even want to think about it but you were talking about it was very interesting talking about that side of\nWell it's you dad the thing is we was on a mixed TV on channel seven yesterday promoting your new show coming out and that happens man just happened to a an eerie ha yeah here's ears perked up when he found out I wasn't just the executive producer of your TV show but\nI was actually have no therapist and because his wife is they have no therapist and so he he spent all probably a half an hour with is just ... and in a quest man quiz me and everything else about it and it's it's just really kind of neat I Love my job is ...\nBut I Want to say this a lot of people think that hit hypnosis is a little weird you know or they think that they don't believe in it or this and that and as he says something people that just don't even want to think about it but you were talking about it was very interesting talking about that side of\nIt well it's you and the thing is is that we was on a mixed TV on channel seven yesterday promoting your new show coming out and pat man just happened to um Iraq it yeah it was ears perked up when he found out I wasn't just the executive producer of your TV show but\nI was actually I have no therapist and because his wife is a little therapist and so he ... he spent all probably a half an hour with is just talking to and and a question man quiz me and everything else about it\nAnd it's it's just really kind of neat I Love my job is not really a job at all it's it's a it's a love of my life how would I go to the next level of success\nI loved when you were talking about you and what you do you've been all over the world doing this you are telling them the schools 'cause you know he was asking you questions that everybody else should be asking yeah my ... never even ask you that on the air so why should talk about 'cause it's very interesting you\nDid you get involved in ... and and and and your schooling because he asked you that\nThat's right I actually got into hip no therapy or by mistake I was going to do it for stage work and I used to own night clubs and I was going to do my own a a a stage show\nAnd I signed up to the school that got hit by a hypnosis and I didn't know anything about him no therapy I just knew about the funny side of it\nWas talking about people that come in and I give them a free our because they have the misconceptions what hypnosis isn't and what a hip no therapist does and enough therapy doesn't have to be grueling it doesn't have to be hard and it doesn't have\nThe negative on facts all mine is very positive in motivational because there's two reasons people fail at anything I don't care what it is first they don't know how to succeed\nSecond they don't want to bad enough so we got to motivate you so when I'm working with people I ... I ... says first I got an education then I got to motivate yet then we go back and find out what keeps drawing you back in the past to either smoking or or drugs or uh over eating and eating the wrong foods\nPlus everybody out there that's overweight everybody knows why they're overweight and a lotta times I'll just look at people when they come man we go over thanks I'll say I know what you're overweight and it was because you eat the wrong foods is wrong times at the wrong quantity for the wrong reason don't eat up the right foods\nDon't drink enough water and they probably don't do enough that she has their sad that they are eating for their self gratification their ... and that's what they're doing\nSome people fail at anything I don't care what it is first they don't know how to succeed\nSecond they don't want to bad enough so we got to motivate you so when I'm working with people I ... I still am I says first I got to educate him then I got to motivate yet then we go back and find out what keeps drawing you back in the past to either smoking or or drugs or uh overeating and eat in their own food\n'cause everybody out there that's overweight everybody knows why they're overweight and a lot of times I'll just look at people when they come in when you go over thanks I'll say I know what you're overweight and it was because you eat the wrong foods is wrong times for the wrong quantity for the wrong reason don't eat up the right foods\nDon't drink enough water and they probably don't do enough that she has\nTheir sad that they are eating for their self gratification\nTheir ... and that's what they're doing their self medicating with food and a lot of times when people quit smoking on their own they've gained weight in fact even their doctors will tell them you're probably gain ten to Fifteen pounds I said that's the worst and you can tell a client\nMy clients never gain weight and they probably if they're overweight they take off a few pounds because they get more options your system and I explained to it or to them why they will and most people are not prepared to stop smoking or getting off the drugs and we prepare him first and then all of a sudden ...\nNobody takes it away from all of a sudden they don't want they don't need any longer that's why there is no withdrawals\nNow we have everybody calling him direct because he likes that to have you leave a message on its own\nIf you want to walk on water you got to get out of the boat so let's go ahead and pick up that phone that number six had to fight for seven zero for for six it's hypnotic the number one dot com\nIt's hot out there and I know it's the summer and no one wants to deal with all this but it's a great time to do it now because you know what what is now going to not be the summer and you're going to be on top of your game you're going to be ready to go and that our weather whatever it is that you want to do before the holiday is still think oh I'm gonna do it after the holiday let's do it now\nThat's ... ... if you don't do it now when you see that's the big question you gotta ask yourself what ... been procrastinating so long and procrastination seems to be the the biggest disease out there if you're going to call anything a disease of progress nation probably is\nBecause it seems to be catching one person doesn't next person does finally you see yourself sitting on my couch forever if you want to sit there that's fine I'm not trying to get to that person I'm getting to the person that's very successful do you want to be even more successful or their mediocre and they want to go to that winning from just being success\nHere's the thing of addicts folks okay there's a lot of people out there that are procrastinators and you know you've got to do something when you get to the lowest\nOf lows that's what it is people get to the lowest have loads and they say I Can't take this any longer I Can't walk up the steps anymore I Can't put on my pants I Can't see my shoes whatever it is\nThat's it and and and when when it's about weight 'cause I've been there and I everybody that has been there when you get tired of buying clothes because you can't fit into um you finally say you know what am I going to stop doing this in what am I going to start going in the other direction or what do I have to do\nEven myself here a while back when I heard something I was gaining weight and hide finally says and that's it\nNow's the time to change I Know what to do I talk to thousands of people even for us a therapist I was working the health clubs I was getting people in shape\nSo I Know what to do but I didn't do it until all of a sudden I says why not why do the same thing I Do it for for my clients and I did that exactly I I listen to a CD\nI'm programming my own self to look at food is only for body nutrition body maintenance repair I don't miss it and ... food becomes very boring to me\nBut wait because I've been there and everybody that has been there when you get tired of buying clothes because you can't fit into um you finally say you know what am I going to stop doing this in what am I going to start going in the other direction or what do I have to do\nEven myself here a while back when I had something I was gaining weight hide finally says and that's it\nNow's the time to change I Know what to do I talk to thousands of people even for us the therapist I was working the health clubs I was getting people in shape\nSo I Know what to do but I didn't do it until all of a sudden I says why not why do the same thing I Do it for for my clients and I did that exactly I I listen to a CD I'm programming my own\nSelf to look at food is only for about a nutrition body maintenance repair I don't miss it and ... food becomes very boring to me ah I find myself a drink and a lot of water doing a lot more physical activities and it's not that I'm forcing myself it's that I Want to do those things see that's\nThat's the thing is when you change your mindset you're not force yourself to lose weight or get off drugs all of a sudden you want to be free you want to move forward you have energy you have things to do places to go and people will see\nAnd you know what you give them a free sixty minute consultation that comes along with a CD there's nothing better there's nothing better than to try this and it can't hurt you all you have to do is give them a call\nTell them what's going on and he can tell you how we can help you that's it it's that simple you can call them at six has to fight for seven zero for for sick leave a message you know call you right back customized programs to meet their needs\nThat's it I I'd customize the program for the person not for their problem as the wise every every smoker has a different situation so if I have a hundred and smokers probably have a hundred different programs that same with weight loss same with motivation same way with drugs\nSo the thing is we got to reprogram that computer sitting on your shoulders so that you want to do these things it's not you're pushing yourself and forcing yourself no because if you do that\nYou're going to go back to your old habits we have used change your mindset and that's what we do we change your mind since so that you become a winner and you take control of your life instead of being controlled by life situation people places or things are events\nTell them what you mean by a lifetime guarantee\nLifetime otherwise we know in our life that there's gonna be situations that gets us off the focus of being in good health\nWe've all done it so the thing is is you might have to either put that CD back in or give me a call maybe in six months or six years and say hey doc I needed to know how much is is free get back in here and I love it when clients come back\nAbsolutely and you know what it cost them anything he also won't like it fails to tell what that means you know\nI don't let people fail billowing fail stay home and do your way 'cause I'm always in your head I'm always said that you can hear that voice of mine and I've I've been told\nThat so many times but the thing is you want to do these things that\nEverybody that is successful has a successful coach around them every professional has a coach whether it's for the reminder body they have a coach and that's what I become too you not just say therapists and Dr Fred I become your coach in your mind and\nEverybody says the same thing when they come in\nYeah gosh why it took me so long to get in your eyes is\nFear fear is one of his saddest things it stops people from moving for or the complacency tapes all started tomorrow I'll started next week how many times have you done that and when there's gotta be the time to do it\nAnd when you do it you finally say why it took me so long it was so simple and so easy right yeah you become successful and that\nBut the thing is you want to do these sanctions everybody that's is successful has a successful coach around them every professional has a coach whether it's for the reminder body they have a coach and that's when I become too you not just a therapist and a doctor friend I'd become your coach and your mind and\nEverybody says the same thing when they

successful\nAnd that number it's six to fight for seven zero for for six the website is hypnotic the number one dot com leave a message call and tell them what's going on where everybody's got something going on I don't care if it's depression I don't care if it's anger if you're OCD there are so many people at that issue it's not funny\nAnd sometimes people don't even know what the issue is they know what the symptom is like smoking or or depression they don't feel good of a sudden they're not feeling good more often throughout the days and throughout their weeks and all of a sudden hey they come in\nThey don't have that any longer so if you've got something going on that you're not either proud of or that you want to get rid of hey stop and see me I'm not twist your arm just stop and say hey\nYou listen for half an hour to an hour I give you a free CD you can go and think about a talk to your husband talk to your wife talk to your dog I don't care\nAt all of a sudden your dogs got really going to love it because you're going to go out for a walk with a dog dogs always want to go out earlier though no one is so hot but the thing is we put you in control of your life instead of being controlled by\nThat number to call again it's six oh two five four seven zero for for sick leave a message and just tell them hey this too and I I Know we don't always talk about every single time but the kids out there to how 'bout them we all have our children that are dealing with issues some of 'em have terrible issues they're getting a bully\nKids really have an unbroken now they're bullied not just in school or on the playground they're bullied cyber Lee yeah otherwise on the computers so the thing is if you want to have that child\nGetting in control bring 'em out but the best thing is is you comment being controlled you instead of telling their child to tell you to do not as I Do want to\nGet out there because if it's good enough for the child he out but it's good enough for you because we're never too old to learn something new\nYou went to school to learn how to do math and English and everything else nobody ever taught you how to use that in mind and that's what I Do\nAgain that number six so to fight for seven zero for for sick leave a message telling what's going on in a call you back and I'll tell you what he can do for\nYou it's not being

always always willing something we're always successful was achieving things or maybe you're a sibling that's always achieving things when you're not\nDo they think different most definitely do they do different action sure because they believe different and that's what we do we change your belief system so that you automatically start thinking different you change your perception about what your situation is and what you are and your future\nGot to get to the root cause that's what it's all about getting down deep and finding out you you're finding out what's bothering is that we can get it out and you could start being successful at what\nEven message telling what's going on in a call you back and I'll tell you what he can do for\nYou it's not being successful just every now and then or when you're focused on it's changing how you look at things change in your perception what's the difference between you and that neighbor that seems like it's always always willing something we're always successful always achieving things or maybe you're a sibling that's always achieving things when you're not\nDo they think different most definitely do they do different action sure because they believe different and that's what we do we change your belief system so that you automatically start thinking differently you change your perception about what your situation is and what you are and your future\nYou guys get to the root cause that's what it's all about getting down deep and finding out you find out what's bothering is it we get it out and you could start being small\nIt gets it each time that you have a negative it gets applied to the ... that month and by the end of the year now you're getting a check back which is what you've been talking about for what over two years now\nWith me and everybody else out in the world out there that that's how she could show you that she could save you want him a bill that you're already paying way too much\nOn and you know here's the thing some people it takes them hearing me one time Carol and they call me right away 'cause they here's something and they go I really want to talk to her and some people it takes hearing me two or three times and that's okay but you know what\nWhen I meet with my family's in my household I'm there to do my very best work for them just like I was there to help my daughter save money on a bill that she was paying way too much money on [noise] and again I couldn't help her pay the bill\nSo I didn't have any backup plan it's this is going to work and this is the way it's going to work\nAnd so when I come out to see your family and your household\n[noise] this is how I design your families now this is going to produce all the power you need ... my little fang produce your own power and pay less for it there's we've just had one of the largest increases in a PS that we've seen in years\nPeople it's not going to stop there I'm having I've made a pretty important circle of friends people that I trust because there's a lot of inaccurate information out there about ... about our power bills from the power company's ads all over TV we don't know who to believe\nSo I go and find the source that I can believe in I verified truth a trust and verifies my saying\nAnd I'm having lunch with one of the board of directors of one of the big electric companies he's become a good friend of mine in a very good source of information as therapy is going to have one of these huge increases and it's not too far off but that the other things that are going to end\n... my little thing produce your own power and pay less for it there's we've just had one of the largest increases in a PS that we've seen in years\nPeople it's not gonna stop there I'm having I've made a pretty important circle of friends people that I trust because there's a lot of inaccurate information out there about our pounds of butter power bills from the power company's ads all over TV we don't know who to believe\nSo I go and find the source that I can believe in I verified truth a trust and verifies my saying\nAnd I'm having lunch with one of the board of directors of one of the big electric companies he's become a good friend of mine in a very good source of information as her pie is going to have one of these huge increases and it's not too far off but the the other things that are going to influence our builds as these things like and I brought a little flyer\nUm prop one twenty seven and it's too complicated and complex to go into in the short time that we have Carol [noise]\nBut I'm going to be doing a town hall\nI'm the first Thursday of the ... the first Sunday of the month before the election onto the going November elections\nSo that we can have a discussion because this thing is very confusing is worded very confusing you think this person voting no I should vote yes you think this person voting yes I should vote now\nCome to the town hall go to my Web site um it's going to be the date sometimes I'm just confirming the Venus I can announce today until it's confirmed the venue but I've got a pretty much locked up [noise] um you want to know where and when and times and everything call me or go to my website and requests information to be emailed to you\nBecause prop one twenty seven and things of the lake are going to affect our power call 'em anytime people tell us we have to do something or the ... are ... a company has to do something [noise]\nThere's ... there's a there's an impact to us some somewhere along the line so I said to my family some people listening in your in your own hopeful you wanna live four to bleed and comfortably in your home on home\nReading you bought your house second to your home powers second largest expense you're going to have over your lifetime an average hopeful will spend approximately about a hundred thousand dollars in the next twenty twenty five years on their power costs\nSo the way that you don't let

extension one for six three the following program as an encore presentation [noise]\n[noise]\n\nHonestly provocative fed largely gun that's\nRight age six six four three nine five to seven seven if you want to take part in honestly provocative\nTalk it is the best conversation at our journalism glad to have you with me on this First Amendment friday night we'll get back to your calls in a moment but I wanted to talk about a shipping tribute to the United states has with China\nAnd about Donald Trump's withdrawal from that and what that says to China and whether or not they are actually listening to us Sean Higgins is a senior writer at the Washington Examiner Shaun welcome to the program\nFor having me some graft in Portland\nA very good it's good to have you on the program what's a what's going on here why why did the president do this\nWell what the president did was he signaled that he's going to be pulling out pulling out of the universal\nPostal union which is the un run the agency that basically sets rates for international meal\nOr there's been a long standing complaint that it says the rates too low for China basically it was set back in Nineteen sixty nine that rate was supposed that was set for basically developing economies and hasn't been adjusted at least not until very recently in their argument is that this amount specifically to big subsidies to try that it's part of\nIt's obviously part of a sort of broader effort the administration is doing to try and find every sort of way an ankle they can to put pressure on trying to change its trade policies and to be honest I've been very inventive about coming up with new ways to do this I mean this postal union thing as one so there has been\nUnder the radar for a long time and it's just interesting and kind of ingenious ways they found it put pressure on them\nBeyond the political pressure let's start with is Sean is there a case to be made that it's not a subsidy to China because after all the postal service loses usually half\nA billion to a billion dollars every year and while they're in it officially they're an independent government agency they haven't been making all their pension payments and I've read the G. A. O. recounts that say\nIf the postal service doesn't pay for its pensions American taxpayers will so every dime they lose while they're under charging a customer is a dime\nHistory is doing to try and find every sort of way an ankle they can to put pressure on trying to change its trade policies and to be honest with me very inventive about coming up with new ways to do this I mean this postal union thing is one something that's been under the radar for a long time and it's just an interesting kind of ingenious ways they found it put pressure on\nWell beyond the political pressure let's start with is Sean is there a case to be made that it's not as subsidy to China because after all the postal service loses usually half\nA billion to a billion dollars every year and while they're in ... officially they're an independent government agency they haven't been making all their pension payments and I've read the G. A. O. recounts that say\nIf the postal service doesn't pay for its pensions American taxpayers will so every time they lose while they're under charging a customer is a dime a or a dollar or a billion dollars that American taxpayers are going to have to pay\nIs there an argument made that were charging a fair rate to China and they shouldn't be paying more\nUm\nThat's interesting question I mean I hadn't really thought about it in those terms I Will say that uh you know the post ... there's nothing there's nothing to prevent the postal service for simply or the administration physically I'm\nIn charge in China a larger rates which is what they may in fact eventually be doing as the consequences of this administration's a decision on this side on this sort of signal the scent of wanting to China or\nThat that that it may do that and that's basically what they're attempting to do so if if the question is can we get more money coming in the U.S postal service that's actually as a viable question and something that may actually be looking to do later on down the line\nBut this also has implications for\nWell I guess for the way they're trying to compete for the United states because as I understand it the UP you this is this the United nations agency or says we're going to allow a flat rate for packages up to four point four pounds so if somebody goes on Amazon and buy something from China\nAnd you know buy something and whether they know it's coming from China or not it shipped from China\nYou have the packages for point four pounds that's two kilos their lives are then they get charged a flat rate and that that allows foreign companies to undercut us competitors who have to pay market right well at least if they're sending things by FedEx or UPS or the other carriers in this country they pay market rate um\nShouldn't shouldn't we did this does having an implication for people buying things because if you find all of a sudden that you're going to have to pay more to ship things if they're coming from China that might actually make American goods are goods from other places competitive whether or not today and the only difference could be the shipping cause right\nThat's exactly that's exactly it and I believe that sort of vehicles the administration is looking at him into a lot of business organizations in the U.S have been making you know precisely that argument that you know it's just simply unfairly trying to be able to do it this way and needs to do something differently and a lot of them are very pleased with the ministry of ... you know picking up the\nBaton on this for like ...\nWell I guess I'm interested to and the implications for the postal service I mean I don't know how many packages are coming from China but given the volume that Amazon and song I've a feeling it's probably a lot\nAnd if you you know if every one of them caused another dollar a dollar and a half to ship a that would not only have implications for U.S companies that are trying to sell to American consumers but it would it have an ... an implication for the postal service to have all of a sudden the rates went up\nTo something that's more like a market rate and they were a bit higher on a\nFew tens of millions of packages that could make a big difference\nNuts is that no you're exactly right on that point it could it could make a substantial difference I mean part of the thing well what's interesting about the Trump Administration is it\nBe able to do it this way and we need to do something differently and a lot of them are very pleased with the administration is is you know picking up the baton on this for like for a\nWhile I guess I'm interested to and the implications for the postal service I mean I don't know how many packages are coming from China but given the volume that Amazon and song I've a feeling it's probably a lot\nAnd if you you know if every one of them caused another dollar a dollar and a half to ship a that would not only have implications for U.S companies that are trying to sell to American consumers but it would it have an ... an implication for the postal service to have all of a sudden the rates went up\nTo something that's more like a market rate and they were a bit higher on a\nFew tens of millions of packages that could make a big difference\nNuts is that now you're exactly right on that point it could it could make a substantial difference I mean\nPart of the thing well what's interesting about the Trump Administration is that they are\nBasically sort of turning over all these rocks hum of issues that people haven't looked at her thought about in a long time and forcing people to you know uh to to deal with them and ... is again is another one of those sort of interesting cases where they're doing that where they're forcing because this has been something that's been going on with\nThe sort of process has been for decades in the first one to say hey wait a minute why are we doing it this way maybe we should do a different way and that's one of the interesting things about the inspiration\nWell especially because and this has gone on from sixty nine to president we've essentially had no no difference in the rates that are being charged flat rates that are being charged for shipping packages is that the is that the case or has there been some kind of inflation escalator and that over the over the last forty or fifty years\nI don't know if it's been I don't know if it's been adjusted for inflation or not I mean there's a ... I Believe the rate has remained the same whether whether that's a you know versus I I don't actually know the exact mechanism weather works as a percentage or not I'm not sure but the rate has remained consistent whether or not it it's a small percentage of Sonia\nSean you you sound like you're a bit younger than me but\nWould you like to be paying for gasoline let's say what you were paying a Nineteen sixty that if you were by gasoline at night I was mowing lawns so I was buying gasoline in Nineteen sixty nine and I know what it costs then and I know what a cause now I'd love to have Nineteen sixty nine gasoline rage or rent I remember my parents used to be a hundred dollars a month for a very nice house\nFor rent and and I'd love to be paying a hundred dollars a month to rent an apartment I'll bet a lot of other Americans would to\nWhy is it that until we get a real business man in office like Donald Trump nobody any of these administrations as a you know Bush or Clinton or or or a bomb or anyone else and said hey maybe we should bring that rate forward why are we still charging the Nineteen sixty nine right\nIt's I mean it it's that and that's a good question and the answers that\nAs with so many things is just so much easier to say I find whatever let\nLet's just let it let it be and move on to something else that somewhat more pressing um and just not deal with it I mean there's there's so many sort of things that just haven't been looked at her dressed or talked about in a long time um and this is another one of the sort of issues and there's a lot of things that they brought up and when they were talking about the\nYou know the trade you know the NAFTA deal and other things that people haven't talked about her address in a while and\nThis is in yeah I mean it's the the answer your question is\nPeople should have people should have been looking and asking these fundamental questions and there's just that sort of mindset of standard sort of Washington that never really bother to do it\nAnd what things about Trump is that he doesn't subscribe to that mindset I mean and sometimes he goes a little bit of a off the edge on some areas but other times you know take somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say\nYou know do we really need to do it this way I mean now that you know\nThe NAFTA negotiations for a good example I mean for a long time people there who wants to and what is going is working fine we don't need to address this really to rock the boat and Trump said no I'm going to rock the\nBoat and see what happens yeah that's exactly what it is doing that again with this\nThe thing that they brought up and when they were talking about it you know the tree you know the NAFTA deal and other things that people haven't talked about are dressed in a while and\nThis is yeah I mean it's the answer your question is\nPeople should have people should have been looking and asking you something about the questions and it's just that sort of mindset of standard sort of Washington but never really probably just do it and what things about Trump has said he\nDoesn't subscribe but mine sent me sometimes he goes a little bit of a off the edge on some areas but other times you know take somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say\nYou know do we really need to do it this way I mean you know with\nThe NAFTA negotiations for a good example for a long time people they're all saying what's gone it's working fine we don't need to address this really trucks Trump's if I'm going to vote and see what happens yeah that's exactly what you're doing that again with the ...\nWell ... it just kind of stunned me because I have a feeling there isn't a company out there in the private sector who doesn't say what are we charging for this is that what our competitors are charging is that what the market will bear and maybe back in Nineteen sixty nine I don't know how much stuff was getting shipped from China\nI mean before uh before next and even sort of open the open does up an open China so we'd had better relations with them I'm not sure how much stuff was getting shipped anyway probably not nearly the volume today but I have to imagine somewhere someone deep in the bowels of the U.S government\n[noise] yeah I mean other than that almost twelve million dollars I'm just under half of that is for historic assets alone so you know do that as you mentioned the lodges that cat and the places that we use and the memories that we have these parks um culture landscapes the battlefield to cemeteries all of that I'm\nI'm all of that as a part of that that um that maintenance backlog\nNow let me ask you this because I've always wanted to run the numbers my wife and I buy an annual pass every year and I think it's Seventy five or eighty bucks and there's a very good deal if you're just going to go to one of the parts one time on one day every year I think you pay\nThirty bucks but if you buy Seventy five or eighty dollar pass and maybe a little bit more now\nThat they would uh you know that that let you go to any national park you want all year long and it's a it's a pretty good deal and I feel\nThat part of this bill should be paid by everybody in America because they're available to everybody but those of us who want to use the parks we pay a little bit more and I don't think that's necessarily wrong I don't think the visitors should pay the entire ... nor do I think the taxpayer should pay the whole tab\nHis her away and I keep wanting twelve billion so we spent a billion a year on top of whatever we're spending now in the poor maintenance we're doing right now we we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold shoot for denies doing five years instead of ten where you could do that\nHow many people visit all of the national parks in a way that would cause them to pay an entry fee or show their past you know\nIt's that's that's a great question I Know that millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our parks um legislation to protest\nThey would uh you know they don't let you go to the national park you want all year long and it's a pretty good deal and I feel\nThat part of this bill should be paid by everybody in America because they're available to everybody but those of us want to use the ... paid a little bit more and I don't think that's necessarily wrong I don't think the visitors to pay the entire ... nor do I think the taxpayers to pay the whole tab\nUser away and I keep wanting twelve billion ... billion a year on top of whatever we're spending now in the ... right now\nWe we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold shoot for be nice to do it in five years instead of town where you could do that how many people visit all of the national parks you know where that would cause them to pay an entry for your show their past you know\nI'm I'm it's that's that's a great question I Know there are millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our parks um legislation does which has bipartisan support is that it it doesn't\nYou know draw or create an additional burden on the taxpayer and in fact the six point five billion dollars which the legislation proposes um\nTowards is almost twelve billion dollar deficit over five years comes from a federal middle revenues onto this is on showing offshore oil and gas I'm so these are things that we um those funds that are already there but they're not earmark on right now for national parks are allocated to other programs but I'm a ...\nA lot of federal budget expert either monitor but if the if money wasn't going to the park to would go to the general treasury and it'd be available for all the other stuff the federal government bonds right\nYeah well the way that these funds are I mean what we are proposing is to to reallocate these funds to to the park so it's not necessarily um you know pulling drawing down our adamant increased burden on the taxpayer and what it does is it is to\nIdentifying a pot of money that we haven't thought about um that could benefit the national parks and I and I think you know what that does of course is with this um six point six and a half billion dollar influx of fun and I think on the back in and then you know\nYou talk and finding out it's always return on investment right so investing this as a country or what are we going to get back for it and you know to that I Will answer me will will have the you know the statue of liberty I Will be preserved and that has a a backlog\nOf maintenance backlogs right now Ellis Island and we know how important um you know that was a stopping point in our\nAmerican story um you know that places like the Little Rock Central High school um in in in Arkansas and that is a historic site and brown v board of education at that you know these are the historic places that tell our story and so we have a ... we have places we can go to talk about um who we are as a country and to get\nTo the numbers of things I mean um we um had an analysis done by the cabinets group and they found that if\nThe if this legislation passed it would create a hundred and ten thousand infrastructure related jobs and so that directly impacts local and caught economies at these national parks are part of and so I Would say you know\nBy redirecting these funds it's a it's an immediate return on investment um for with these local communities can get and the job they create um by just restoring places that we already know hum are important to to who we are as a country\nTo monitor who's opposing\n[noise] up you know\nUp right now there's a bipartisan support so us on on\nBoth sides I think right now we're we're trying\nTo get through and we're hoping to get this legislation passed in the next month or two so after the election um to to really get boots on the ground and get to work around are around us so we're we're you know kind\nOf caught into um the the bill is now in the legislation is now in sub committee and it's coming out of that soon but we you know or need to the Congress to act right now um to to get this passed for us\nSo it's something that they've already got by\nYou know by redirecting these funds it's a it's an immediate return on investment for what these local communities can get and the job they create um by just restoring places that we already know hum are important to to who we are as a country\nSo Monica who's opposing\nUp you know\nUp right now there is a bipartisan support so it's on on\nBoth sides I think right now we're we're trying\nTo get through and we're helping 'em to get this legislation passed or in the next month or two after the election um to to really get boots on the ground and get to work around are around us and where were you know kind\nOf caught into um the the deal is now and and the legislation is now in subcommittee it's coming out of that soon but we you know I Need to to Congress to act right now uh to to get this passed rest\nSo it it's something that if they've already got bipartisan support it should be a done deal done is anybody playing politics with the same World War not doing that until you do something else\nYou know I'm I'm I Would say I'm I'm sure that day is the case [laughter] but but I you know I Would also argue that yeah I I I'm a big huge preservation is in fact yeah of course I work for the national trust 'em you know but you know preservation as a as a as a bipartisan I'm\nA you know it's it's good for Republicans and Democrats I guess good outside\nThe all clear about our heritage I just wanted I think it would be hard for somebody to oppose it on\nA true but I I just figure on Capitol Hill they don't even agree to go to lunch I'll go to lunch voted for my farm bill while I'm not going on with you unless you vote

across the country\nNow international and national polls show the ... about twenty percent more Republican than it is a Democrat and folks you know the Republicans are conservative tend to vote more than liberals so why do they see Texas as a potential blue state because of election fraud\nAnd because they're cheating we're gonna have to work harder and got the Washington Times you name it\nAll reporting on Democrats public cleave registering illegal aliens do vote\nNow illegal aliens while there's not a big deal usually folks vulgar names of dead folks\nUsually homeless people by bus around to doing that is well no but they're telling you illegals that it's okay and that it's there right now and they have to make it official because the average illegal doesn't want to commit a crime actually on average there to sharing legally spilled which tend to be picked up\nAnd show the extent of their criminal activity is is is generally just wanting a better life\nBut the Democrats are

articles him where they Alex ... still on Twitter despite the ban\nOh we've got MSN reporting we'll see you on that hit him off get everything off\nBut now you can't even make a joke that perhaps we'll all be arrested her doing now is it that you're no longer than a man by who can't criticize\nYou hit that come in the day but I could be correct and I am currently a real rep toyed fourteen years old on the planet and diarrhea\nHillary Clinton's\nRoyal any part in a whole other criticized uh what do you think Mr night\nWhile I think if we could show that she was at least zero point zero nine percent reptilian MBNA then should qualified just like Elizabeth Warren qualifies for being a Cherokee but no Alex ... you know we look at the Elizabeth Warren bang it ... should have been considered to be ...\nAnd I thought it was perfect for the Bible and read that story saying that after looking at Elizabeth Warren's thing ... had her own DNA tests that she's had those conservative July I'm not a hundred percent reptilian DNA I'm only fifty percent now what what are the Daily Beast did\nWas really reprehensible on a number of levels are they came out yesterday at five twenty six pm eastern standard time\nOr they came out that shows that it's been for wars that lower permanently banned from Twitter in September ... moved seemed to be a death blow for input wars just weeks before they make a crop of platforms like YouTube and Facebook now of course they don't mention the fact\nThat YouTube and Facebook and apple recruiting they did it within hours of each other all of them doing it at the same time and then of course they also included with the press and we saw this pattern happened again last week\nUh we had another eight hundred alternative media sites that were shut\nIt was it should have been considered to be satire\nAnd I thought it was perfect for the Bible invaded that story saying that after looking at Elizabeth Warren's thing to equate Hillary had her own DNA tests that she's had those conservatives are lying I'm not a hundred percent reptilian DNA I'm only fifty percent now what what are the Daily Beast it\nWas really reprehensible on a number of levels are they came out yesterday at five twenty six pm eastern standard time\nOr they came out and said our shows that it's been for wars that lower permanently banned from Twitter in September ... moved seemed to be a death blow for info wars just weeks before the makeup of platforms like YouTube and Facebook now of course they don't mention the fact\nThat YouTube and Facebook and apple recruiting they did it within hours of each other all of them doing it at the same time and then of course they also included with the press and we saw this pattern happened again last week\nUh we had another eight hundred alternative media sites that were shut down Facebook and Twitter within hours of each other the press it already been notified the press already had their stories ready to run just like they did with us\nSo they're they're wringing their hands of the Daily Beast saying well they should be down but they're still up\nHow are they still have power they still are communicating with people and how do we get them off for the remaining social media sites and so they then site me they said in fact two months after Jones and infowars are supposedly ... number of accounts remain live tweeting on Tuesday the Twitter account for infowars real new show\nWith hosts David night promoted nights claim that Hillary Clinton is quote fifty percent reptilian DNA\nSo they put that out there as if I'm taking that seriously you know it is a satire or Elizabeth Warren's claims are satire but Alex the real amazing thing about this to me is that it was the Daily Beast that was attacking Danny Williams when he was asking a real question a Bill Clinton\nAnd that was please take a DNA test so I can know who my father as you've paid a highway patrol in Arkansas every Christmas they would deliver cash my mother my mother who was black says that you are my father I looked like you I'm lighter skinned and my sister\nCan I please have some closure on this will you please take a DNA test either a ... a put this to rest and showed that it's not true or then to uh let me know that I've got a father and do and you know ... will come into the family and he was vilified\nVilified by the press there in that press conference especially by this reporter from the Daily Beast that she was so bad Alex ... you remember that it was live streamed Iran and for wars\nI at one point attacked her instead of talking to Danny Williams I said how dare you treat him like this is who are you and it's and I'm David night from ... in Fort Worth and this is the Daily Beast shutting down one land\nOn that ... expand their like how dare they may have more communicate because they want to be a whole lot about us and we want violence and that we want to attack the press\nOh hey call from blowing up the White House wall Rosie O'Donnell call for the military and take crop up at the White House while they say hash tag ... Republican hall they cannot bear and ... all they say all of this insane crap they want to silence everywhere\nAnd then when you read and say it's a satire article I've seen the video replay it later\nAnd he any joke about a satire article and make jokes have and misrepresent that were saying and we've only rep toy that Ryan hang on that not only said that's not what we do it's like I said I say\nThat there is a Martian motivational flame children have offered a million dollars this is a war of mouth from Star Trek not real into health everybody knows that\nThey'll probably say in fact the last time I didn't look like five years ago they said don't things lizards that rail and depressed up like one of the show [laughter] their own readers don't get that power this is an incredible mental illness for\nA one these people are doing and it just gets more and more and more insane David and again do you agree with me that ahead of the ...\nWell they say all of this insane crap they want to silence everywhere\nAnd then when you read and say it's a satire article not seen the video replay it later and he any joke about a satire article and make jokes they misrepresented were saying and we've only rep toy derive from that not only said that's not what we do it's like I said I say\nThat there's a Martian Monday slate and tell her I'm offered a million dollars or more miles from Star Trek this is not real into health everybody knows that\nThey'll probably say in fact the last time I didn't look like five years ago they said don't think was or rail and pressed up like one of the show their own readers don't get that power this incredible mental illness\nOf what these people are doing and it just gets more and more and more insane David and\nAgain do you agree with me that ahead of the midterms they're planning something really really big but they're everywhere saying Trump's going to cause violence I here's one out here\nAre just today there's just tons of each a shame that Trump's going to get a bunch of people killed Trump wants to meeting a dead a vox editor Trump supporters will murdered journalist I mean it's just incredible they're the ones calling from ...\nWell Alex you know they could be laying the foundation for that but let me tell you something they have overthrown our government and our foundation and our constitution and our individual rights if we allow them to get away with shutting down the free press and free speech free speech\nIs separate from the freedom of the press is bad enough to take away the freedom of the press for what they're doing on social media is taking away the building of people\nTo read the press and then comment on what they agree with what they disagree with and that's what they are taking down and they understand that satire I I honestly don't think they're that stupid I honestly don't think the Twitter is that stupid they did it within a couple of hours of this\nNo they don't know what your frog David and again yeah Twitter is used more than telephones now in many areas or\nAs the head of Penn and teller came out and shed that it's more power from the courts now show they show on shows and then they demonize this and they the famous and we don't\nHave an way to respond back where post legal notices are challenged their lives and they are abusing their authority big tax out of control even the head of Google Now admits they're censoring people and says yeah we're helping China he told Congress in a letter last week censorship can help the government it's a good service were offering\nMhm yeah and we can use its outside of China as well and then we saw the good sense or document that was not Breitbart saying that we're not going to follow\nThe model but has been the historically an America where we have a free marketplace of free speech we're going to follow the European idea that we're going to have dignity instead of liberty well that's not European idea really that's a BF Skinner a behavioral modification idea he wrote the book or\nA beyond freedom and dignity that's really where they're going they're trying to modify our behavior\nThat's right and they take your popular Twitter account down very genteel professional show you out and then a lie about you and say you believe space aliens runs range and that does Hillary earlier rap toy and engage in fake news flawed against you when the silence you that use the criminal activity we're dealing with\nWhether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula for just one an alternative painful wars life have the formula for you\nAnd engage in fake news flawed against you when the silence you that is the criminal activity we're dealing with\nWhether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula for just one an alternative painful wars life have the formula for us\nThat would be a step up for I sleep\nThere'd be a reptilian space lizard\nShowing says it's satire he said it'd be a step up for it had to update and apologize hey we're satire sight but everybody's getting really upset about dish yeah people are now being banned for covering your satire and saying it's satire and then lying and saying you didn't say at satire\n[noise] but I never even sits directly said that there were Martian colleagues wouldn't ... children on them\nThey just made it up at why not because of that can silence you than\nThey can say whatever they want about you that's the other equation of censorship David he'll be back tomorrow where people can censor for now am till eleven AM infowars dot com forward slash show and that's why it's so critical ... emailed her friends and family daily unsafe first women under attack here's what they don't want you to hear\n... friends and family are articles the live feed simple wars dot com or slide show works the pages we posted shape what the topic the top top unusual people understand this she's urging they're trying to shut us down out of the election and only by listeners\nSpreading the word signing up for free newsletter and then sending that email on a and force dot com forward slash newsletter only by doing that will we get around the sensors David\nAbsolutely Alex and you know we're talking about DNA as I said before the serious question about DNA was shut down at that press conference by the daily beach though when daily daily Williams wanted to know if a Bill Clinton would take a DNA test to verify or to deny his fraternity but of course we'll talk a little bit about the DNA of the Daily Beast\nOr it was just a few days ago that we pointed out that the Chelsea Clinton sets on the\nBoard of the company that owns the Daily Beast and she's been rewarded with six point six million dollars for doing so so I guess that makes a a Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton part of the DNA of the Daily Beast is their ancestors showed up there and then the grandmother of the Daily Beast\nBut Alex I Want to say something about Twitter because you know we've had the situation with a\nA fair con coming out and saying uh Jews or he's not anti Semitic he's editor might then they said well that doesn't violate our rules because you didn't say that about a specific person they're saying that I violated the rules because I had targeted harassment of a specific person in other words they'll re Clinton and you know being a reptile\nNow so I figure they're not saying it's\nHis fraternity but of course we'll talk a little bit about the DNA of the Daily Beast or it was just a few days ago that we pointed out\nThat the Chelsea Clinton sites on the board of the company that owns the Daily Beast and she's been rewarded with six point six million dollars for doing so so I guess that makes a a Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton part of the DNA of the Daily Beast is their ancestors show the parent and the grandmother of the Daily Beast\nBut Alex I Want to say something about Twitter because you know we've had the situation with a\nA fair con coming out and saying uh Jews or he's not anti Semitic he's editor might then they said well that doesn't violate our rules because you didn't say that about a specific person they're saying that I violated the rules because I had targeted harassment of a specific person in other words Hillary Clinton and you know being a reptile\nNow so I figure they're not saying it's bullying truck if she calls me a dark caught in the worst person in the world\nBut yeah I I Can't say anything bad about her\nAnd she's serious about that but let me you know when we had this a statement this interview with wired magazine that Jack Dorsey had talking about Twitter CEO of Twitter\nAnd he said all that stuff about us being the free speech wing of the free speech party that was just a joke you know they become a joke themselves but they went on to say a lot of people come to Twitter they don't actually see an app or service\nThat kind of looks like it's a public square and they have the same sort of accept the expectations of a public square and that is what we have to make sure they get right also make sure that everyone feels safe and that public square so he uses the term public square three times when he testified before Congress to use the term public square five times Alex we have a Supreme Court decision\nThat says Nineteen forty six marshals Alabama that if you are in the public square even if it is privately owned that they can't stop your speech and the public square we've let a Supreme Court decision roe v Wade killed tens of millions of babies but we ignore this Supreme Court decision that would protect us from having the public square killed by\nAll there is no doubt that they operate and they have liability protection because they are a public square and jump back in the center publishers censor us if Congress just acts the president actions over for them for whatever you do folks they can't stop you

drove up to the it's called the ... river country\nAnd that was developed into a pharmaceutical drugs for cancer treatment and it's been very effective at that had a lot of success with it over the years it's a it's a big seller\nAnd a tax solved\nA drug originally derived from the EU treaty that's how I originally got involved in the ... business was supplying a pharmaceutical company with the ... from the huge tree and that's where they originally extract the extracted the drug before\nThey figured out how to synthesize it\nAnd when they did set aside that um they made the announcement and early nineties for uh we work for them for three years Ninety One Ninety to Ninety three and a Ninety four they announced that [noise] excuse me they had a\nSet the size it so I knew enough at that point and I had been studying the at no botany or the ... tree and the Pacific northwest and how the Native Americans use that and\nI started making tea out of the needles myself I had heard some stories of people in the northwest making a tea out of the needles from the huge tree and creating themselves for cancer was success\nSo I was referred down to the by medical center in Tijuana, Mexico by some folks up here some friends in Montana who had been down there\nAnd been treated for cancer successfully and what they specialize in at the ... medical center which is also known as the ... clinic ... is ...\nNinety to Ninety three and\nA Ninety four they announced that [noise] excuse me they had a set the size it\nSo I knew enough at that point and I had been studying the at no botany or the ... tree and the Pacific northwest and how the Native Americans use that\nAnd I started making tea out of the needles myself I had heard some stories of people in the northwest making a T the

down there and been treated for cancer successfully and what they specialize in at the ... medical center which is also known as the ... clinic\nNut is non toxic cancer treatments\nAnd they've been very successful at it over the years we've been working with them for twenty four years now and I have seen\nLiterally hundreds of patients down there that have gone down there in advanced stages and they got it turned around and they were healthy\nYeah and then out of that use me situation uh you probably take and a\nSin to these patients that go down to the bio medical center the Montana you as a a additional product that the doctors recommend down there that's about eighty to eighty five percent correct rough\n[noise] yeah uh about eighty to eighty five percent of their patients get the you tip capsules included in their protocols\nAnd we we get an email ... Monday through friday every day from the clinic was the name in the address the patient and what the doctors want us to send them and we ship the products directly to the patients from Montana\nRight and you ship the mud and you to Australia to South Korea to Canada and probably Europe too is that correct\nAll over the world the only country we've never been able to get into with through the post office was Germany they have a highly regulated herbal a system there they they regulate or flight pharmaceutical companies\nYes yeah yeah in fact that's what you find on every corner over there is a job and of course some of the names are a little different and you do need a prescription so uh yeah it is a highly regulated in and they're not going to take something or like this through their mail systems so\nUh that's too bad because I'm sure there's people from Germany that have been over to the biomedical centered on your Tijuana and I'll tell you that is very simple to go there and uh\nLater on we'll get some information on on the biomedical center and Jennifer you had to\nCall yes I did I had a call and the caller wanted to know Roger ... time did you know seen because I Know that when you are diagnosed from a medical doctor which cancer and the ... medical center also recommends taking up to nine cats so I stay in that\nStandard can you take more should you take last what about the Kenyan and what is right because I Know not everybody has seen what would you recommend rats\nThe nine capsules a day a dose aids was developed by the doctors through years of experience down at the bio medical center and at three in the morning create noon and three in the evening time with meals with a K some people uh\nWill bump up to twelve the most I've ever heard of anybody taking was a lady in New York through that stage\nYou know seen because I Know that when you are diagnosed from a medical doctor with cancer and the ... medical center also recommend taking up to nine capsules I stay in that\nStandard can you take more should you take last what about that scene in and what is right 'cause I Know not everybody gets the same what would you recommend rats\nThey nine capsules a day or do said was developed by the ... through years of experience down at the ... medical center and that's three in the morning create their own and three in the evening time with meals with a okay some people uh\nWill bump it up to twelve the most I ever heard of anybody taken was a lady in New York to that stage for breast cancer if he was taking a sixteen a day\n... she got very aggressive with it but last I heard she was okay in the cancer wasn't there anymore and she was still alive that's been many many years ago\nBut if somebody's just using the capsule says are preventative like what Terry does is two to three days it\nSufficient\nYes that's about what I'd taken the capitals are so small very easy to do even a senior citizens can take those with ease and uh [noise] we do have some information about bio medical center and uh\nThe u._s. telephone number six one nine four O. seven seven eight five eight six one nine four zero seven seven five eight you call those are numbers\nThey will tell you how to um possibly get a hotel room how to get picked up on the California side of the border a chicken directly right down to the bio medical center and even picked up after your a day is over\nIt's about medical center in a bus you back across the border in the medical line which will save you about an hour and a half to get back to cross the border\nWhen I was down there a couple of years ago to look and see and meet the owner\nUm we took the bus on the way back to the band stretch ban it took us about an hour to get through customs because we're in the medical line which they do have a a\nMuch easier ... grass out of Mexico into the country\nSo it must have been ten or twelve fourteen lines of traffic mhm\nCrossing from a Tijuana into San Diego so it's a super busy place however you can drive across the border and uh I tell you what you just drive across the board because there's absolutely nothing stopping you are there are cameras so I imagine they could react really quickly\nBut you could just about three miles over the border when you get to the bio medical center\nI went there to find out hey if it was legit\nAnd I walked away thinking that\nIf I ever knew to decide the tuition that the place that I Would go\nThis is the places I'd recommend to my family and friends to go if they ever wants to treat a cancer and do it

the bottom medical center at then breast and ovarian and cervical cancers\nOr prostate cancer that's one place where really signed non small cell lung cancer and lymphoma this\nAnd that was they used they even included in leukemia protocols\nSo it's got a pretty broad a application to several different types of cancers\nThe only one that it doesn't seem to be as effective on as far comas um sometimes that well sometimes it ... it depends on the individual and how they respond and I think their diet has a lot to do with it in those situations but the garden anonymous melanoma is a\nAre

could be somebody that I could partner with the tell everybody what you do out there\nWell heck millionaires so I'm the kind of back story of how I got here as I grew up in farm in Nebraska right no conversation about money that whole thing that most people grow up with a K. and then I'm\nJust decided you really commit my when I read thinking grow richest Seventeen and I thought oh my gosh there's a way to get rich and not let this you know work hard\nYou know work out of life and um did a lot of work with the rich dad a community um and then in two thousand four wrote my first well spoke with Jake Oliver loves when I'm really well and McGraw Hill found me\nGave me a huge huge huge retainer and said well you write how you create millionaire so Nineteen Ninety nine with my millionaire year I did it in real estate and gas and oil which a lot of people rich don't realize um gas and oil is an eighty five percent depreciation schedule everybody needs in their portfolio so I became a millionaire and then just kept doing it uh making\nOther people millionaires in real estate and then the guy how civil rights about how you do it and I said I'm a high because I just do it well when you have to write down a process you gotta like al ... got to be duplicated ball so we committed all of two thousand five\nInch or two thousand six\nReally really documenting how do people become millionaires and there is a system there is a process it's not difficult and we just ramped up our game I hit five New York times best seller is year after year after year and you know got a massive following in every continent but Antarctica\nAnd then if you're serious about it we're we know how to do it we did three five years for the majority of people who work and you know is their crop out\nYou know take all the real stuff doesn't work well I Would I Would challenge that person to get on the phone and say you don't work you just want to sit on your house and do nothing now what I Love about this emergency meeting you is\nKnow you don't it's not you don't have the have you been in real estate well actually I don't have tenants I don't have\nAnd then the got health or write about how you do it and I said I'm a high because I just do it well when you have to write down a process you got it's got a system it's gotta be duplicated bull so we committed all of two thousand five\nInch or two thousand six really really documenting how do people become millionaires and there is a system there is a process it's not difficult and we just wrapped up our game I hit five New York times best seller is year after year after year and you know got a massive following in every continent but Antarctica\nAnd then get you're serious about it we're we know how to do it and we did three five years for the majority of people who work and you know is their crop out\nAnd say well world stuff doesn't work well I Would I Would challenge that person to get on the phone and say you don't work\nYou just want to sit on your house and do nothing now what I Love about this emergency meeting you is you know you don't it's not you\nDon't have the have you been in real estate right just like I don't have tenants I don't have mortgages that you know it's such a different strategy and like you said more millionaires have been made in this space and I think also um heavily in the green rush Canada space I think\nWe're in the greatest from her life yeah yeah and then you say ... ... um that it's that\nRings true to me and I say this all the time it's not hard to make money but it's hard to keep if you take it a step further though it's not it's not hard to become a millionaire is what you do when you get their rights there's this process and with from the get go day one\nOf making a plan and that's what you do your people write you set on a plan with them and then you work with them you make sure that they have everything behind them so if anything happens like emergencies et cetera that are covered right\nWell they're covered if they have and they pay attention I mean what most people biggest problem in life and business if they're an entrepreneur is most people don't follow through\nRight and so you know once we start to plan you got to follow through with the economy is starting to shift if Trump makes another announcement of whether it's the cannabis space or the wall or digital currency the SEC makes like you just got to pay attention I think most people don't pay attention\nThey want the park and pray methods around the park my money that's going to work out and I've ever have to do anything so I'm regrets and you saw it and ... if you don't want to learn than I'm not your girl I'm not I'm we're not done for you uh were a do it

people who cannot just using it gives us a lot on how the child gets it you know you can learn it and the biggest thing is to thank you if you care about someone else and you're curious about someone else\nMight ask them questions so what do you do how do you do why do you do that it should be engaged with somebody else's life instead of your own problems in your own drama\nThat anybody can learn I liked that\nKerry and care and you'll learn it just it just to come in natural and then it's not a mistake rehearsed because there are some people who I have to train it they just actually\nIt doesn't occur to them to give a shit about anybody else but right now right at it I guess somebody buying your business you know product or service you're never going to raise capital\nLike you you have to care about somebody else and you got it curious about somebody else so anybody can learn those I think you know I master fleet trained obviously I mean I get a lot of money to get trained to

to worry that I ah\nThat I was too enthusiastic and my descriptions of it to people who elevated expectations and I don't worry about that anymore because what I've discovered is that\nA regardless of what I say about it actually going through the museum a exceeds whatever descriptions I've given people about it it's a very very special place um and it's a it's a wonderful thing to have it here in the valley\nYeah it is you know um my co host here as well you with him and museum show Salah moaning share with me and uh I don't think he's ever met\nYou okay and the Mets met somebody up there that he's got a an assistant or somebody that I gave all the information to a while back and she was released we all wish I could remember her name she was\nLike well I'm I think it might have been ... she's a but a Beagle you and I talked a little about this last time I was on the show true yeah\nUm it's a\nIt's an amazing place I'm not sure if your if your guests if your listeners know um but there's an exhibit for every single country in the world when that museum and it's really you know it's a musical instrument museums so it's about\nThe musical instruments to those various countries but I don't much deeper level it really is a museum that uh showcases the cultures of the world through the music of those cultures in what really puts it over the top\nOr the videos that are that are on all of these exhibits there's a video monitor on a every exhibit three hundred and fifty or so and the curators have a source to about thirty five hundred video clips\nOf people playing the music and those various countries and cultures in the context in the indigenous context of the country and do you wear headphones as you walk through the headphones or why pies you walk up to an exhibit you automatically start to hear the music coming from those screens\nOr as\nUm I had a a friend who was blind musician who went through it and he said that he was the most extraordinary museum experience he'd ever had and he thought his head was going to explode [laughter] personally at that time that it's even a museum that people without sight could appreciate\nYou know and and I had the opportunity to take Stevie Wonder through the museum a short time after that and then I and I realized that was hold true he was just\nLocked into every exhibits fascinated by\nFive hundred video clips of people playing the music and those various countries and cultures in the context in the indigenous context of the country and\nYou you were headphones as you walk through the headphones a wide pies you walk up to an exhibit you automatically start to hear the music coming from those screens or as\nUm I had a friend who was blind musician who went through it and he said that it was the most extraordinary museum experience he'd ever had and he thought his head was going to explode [laughter] personally at that time that it's even a museum that people without sight could appreciate\nYou know and then I had the opportunity to take Stevie Wonder through the museum a short time after that but then I and I realized that was hold true he was just\nLocked into every exhibits asked me if I have\nNo low when you walk me through there and it's been a while what really attracted my attention was what you were talking about the instrumentation from different countries are so unique I mean yeah\nI I couldn't imagine what these instruments war you had to see them they're really on the chest quite unique and\nUnique and at the same time all the cultures make ends you know what's interesting though the similarities to that every country has a string instrument usually we make them out of the same materials all over the world would and uh ... sometimes stone and metal and a\n... but we all we we make these instruments that are very similar to one another and then they kind of shift from one place to another over time like bagpipes originally came out of one corner\nOf Europe and then spread across Europe is the migration that's happened and ended up as the primary interest is the instrument of\nScotland and Ireland and but at the same time they're very much a part of the some European cultures\nOr um that is a rational wait a minute [laughter] the bagpipes are getting rain just write your blowing the are going to do what goats skin and squeeze in it to get the sound to come out and until it's all up and running to pressure it's got some awesome sounds that can make if you don't know what you're doing\nBut hey you know low and they got all these shows and stuff over there because you also have the theater we were hoping that maybe you could tell some people like what times those shows are and what you've got coming up\nAbsolutely um we are ah ah we have this year we will

hour class um if it's a refresher or if you just want to get your Arizona permit after you've got another permit from another state we offer a four hour class which is actually more five actually five hour class really what we call it a four hour class\nA and that is just me covering long legal aspects of gun ownership and gun usage and the state of Arizona\nSo we offer both of those ... we

that you said because when you say them in a little bit of a legal um you know verbiage uh people may not pick it up quite like they need to\nLike that happened I got you went to we sang outlets clarify when\nYou say that they have to have their weapon it can carry a concealed a lot of people don't realize that uh things you see in the movies like where the guy opens his coat and shows the guy but he's arguing with his gun that's an illegal move\nThey bought a CAT scan is the wet than if you're in an argument with somebody 'cause you've just got out a way to the argument with that exposure there are things like that people need to know that are in these laws that will help them\nBe safe and the way they go about the escalation of an event that if it like you said God Forbid leads to having to draw your weapon you need to know what what steps are required to be covered and following the rules in such a an instance so I'm Glad that you think that\nAt Lincoln my class and

confrontation with the cabin proof\nAnd you could spend a year in prison he's going to be a prohibitive possess or convicted twenty nine year old ... adjusting Riley ... was on southwest flight eight five nine he sat next on on identified woman right before the takeoff he put his arm on her leg\nAnd when she refused his advances forcibly tried to play with the with her so this is one I Would have punched him in his throat and kicked him in his crank and stumped on him until they had to land the plane because I Would chicken is but\nAh she tried to make them stop his actions he allegedly pulled on her sweater tried to ask her to go out finally flight attendants intervene and moved to a new seat he filled and stop the harassment when he tried to approach her again he got into a confrontation with the cabin crew a he said that she was flirting with him they think he was under the influence of drugs\nBut he apparently had a criminal record in the history of violence I'm not kidding you\nI ... world one real quick story sitting on a plane one time and I was in a window seat I hate when disease I like to sit in the aisles because I like to control the day I'll accept\nAnd uh somebody I felt something called and claiming touch my elbow and I turned around I Swear hands just guy it was some little skinny hipster dude who had his grocery dirty naked feet on my arm writes in his toe touched my elbow I wasn't I wasn't even going to demonstrate courtesy a turned around I said if you don't move your feet I'm going to punish them off [noise]\nHe looked at me like I was insane and I said I mean it and he finally moved to the end he didn't touch him again and I had to use another brand new one white because they wise everything down to write that down to wipe that part of my arm right down in case my elbow touched it again and the white my elbow off I Will punch your feet right the hell off your ankles if you touch me with them\nEspecially on a plane Michael ... backs off his Texas resist almost rally a Trump is having a rally at six thirty today in Texas a and a Michael ... he was going to hold a counter resistance rally but because he's having some tax problems\nLike apparently he was like millions I Will talk about that coming up or they're not gonna yeah that could he probably was only going to attract tens of people\nThat's why nobody nobody wants to go out of the guys of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez the males really on and Joaquin Castro does that defeated nowadays is like a blueprint for defeating global warming\nNot even making this up this is an actual legitimate thing that she had said she said quote that we talk about ... at the central dressed and the last time we really had a really major at the central throw around World War two and so we've been here before and we have a blueprint of doing this before\nShe legit compared it to not I'm not even kidding you\nNot even getting so nobody won the mega millions thing\nCan you believe this it's going to be two billion dollars\nThis school raised the two billion now that's not even all of it to the ball is it six hundred million I don't even I don't gamble and I don't I don't\nPlay the lottery I made my husband get lottery tickets and he complained about it the entire time and said it was a tax on stupidity and they said well I guess you got to pay it sometime so\nThe Powerball jak part of the six hundred and twenty million the mega million in its right now well the last measurement was at one point six billion they say it's going to be up to about two million or two billion I'm Sorry two billion with a beat\nAre you going to get your ticket\nShe legit compared it to not I'm not even kidding you not even getting so nobody won the mega millions thing\nCan you believe this it's going to be two billion dollars\nThat school raising two million now that's not even all of it has a ball in the next hundred million I don't even I don't gamble\nAnd I don't I don't play the lottery I made my husband get lottery tickets any complained about it the entire time and said it was a tax on stupidity\nAnd they said well I guess I got to pay it sometime so now the Powerball jak part of the six hundred and twenty million the mega million in its right now while the last measurement was at one point ... billion they say it's going to be up to about two million\nOr two billion I'm Sorry two billion with a beat\nAre you going to get your ticket\nAnd they have a lot more coming up later that the caravan\nOf\nBecause they got to get their feet\nIt got to get their feet\nSo everybody that they they go through and they pay the sea\nSo I Can't imagine\nAnd many other places at the southern border\nAnd I can't imagine how that's going to work he notes that they have to go through about twelve hundred miles of a through Mexico\nAnd a lot of that because they're on the western side geographically speaking you know a lot of that goes right through some of the heart most hardcore controlled\nA drug cartel the\n... a sin to lower cartel and some of the other cartels down there\nThat um they're on the eastern side or sorry the western side\nThat some really seriously cartel controlled places that they're going to be going through I Can't imagine them not being exploited\nI just can't imagine and find a way although\nThe less than that it's all women and children there are some\nWomen who looks suspiciously like him in a lot of them they look just like\nMan many many many many many men\nI saw more men and I thought women and children\nCame and let's say there is ten thousand listen there's only five thousand but not one hundred percent of those people are good people there there is a faction of those people that are there to take advantage of those\nThat are making the travel for some reason so you know for Democrats to support this and to continue to be a beacon in a magnet for people like this to show up illegally is actually harmful to their own life\nSide that some really seriously cartel controlled places that they're going to be going through I Can't imagine them not being exploited\nI just can't imagine and by the way although\nThe less than that it's all women and children there are some\nWomen who looks suspiciously like I'm In a lot of them they look just like\nMan many many many many many men\nI saw more men and I thought women and children\nCame and let's say there is ten thousand listed it was only five thousand but not one hundred percent of those people are good people there there is a faction of those people that are there to take advantage of those\nThat are making the travel for some reason so you know for Democrats to support this and to continue to be a beacon in a magnet for people like this to show up illegally because actually harmful to their own life\nWell yeah I mean and they contribute to\nThe human trafficking\nIt's it's I mean because you're going to what is it but some of the border patrol agents told me that they would carry a plan B\nFor some of these ... little girls that become a little girls that would come across I heard some horror stories and I'm not even gonna repeat here on air\nUm for some of the border agents\nAnd some of the chiefs down there who am I have spoken to face to face whenever I've been down near the border and I\nMean it's amazing to think that the stuff happens in twenty teens it is amazing to think that this habit\n... sick or is the fact that the media would rather ... says Trump being evil and not accepting these caravans or whatnot as opposed to what really goes on to these ... I think\nAbout it like if these people\nBecause they said that they wanted they they were trying to say that they want an embassy in Mexico city where you're going to have to fill out the paperwork and go through all of that well they didn't want to wait for the processing time\nDo you think that the processing time if they if they make it to the U.S border is going to be any easier or any faster\nThan what they saw when they were at the border between Guatemala and Mexico\nHardly doubt it\nNow the president has said look this is a national emergency here\nUh they are the Caribbean has grown inside the president says that it's a national emergency\nAnd he they in the meanwhile they've they've they have successfully crossed into Mexico they regrouped\nThe Mexican ... failed to turn any of them back basically\nThat he has said he's ready to send troops to the border\nBecause it's a national emergency emergency and that it is you know honestly also how or does everyone even have proper documentation cetera et cetera et cetera\nIt is I've read in some instances it the caravan as either a mile or two miles long\nAnd for the most part they print been pretty unimpeded I mean I'm Sorry I looked when they were going across the border there and Guatemala and Mexico it didn't look like they were they were impeded at all\nThat it it didn't look at I mean they just busted the gate there was just not\nIt didn't look it didn't look any it didn't look that\nThey it just looked like they walk or ride on through ... and that was pretty much it\nSo that's that's the that's problematic\nAnd if these individual ... aren't if they don't want to wait for\nIn Mexico for any because see that's the thing they didn't they didn't have to come to the United states they could have stopped and in Mexico and they could have filed for amnesty et cetera but that's not what they want to do\nThey want to go beyond that\nThey're wanting to go all the way up to the border\nSays if they cover about Fifteen to twenty miles per day could take anywhere from sixty to eighty days well that would be after mid term\nThe border there and Guatemala and Mexico it didn't look like they were they were impeded at all\nThat it it didn't look at I mean they just busted the gate there was just not\nIt didn't look it didn't look any it didn't look that\nThey just look like they walk right on through ... and that was pretty much it\nSo that's that's the that's problematic\nAnd if these individuals' aren't aren't if they don't want to wait for\nIn Mexico for any because see that's the thing they didn't they didn't have to come to the United states they could have stopped and in Mexico and they could have filed for amnesty et cetera but that's not what they want to do\nThey want to go beyond that\nThey're wanting to go all the way up to the border\nKane says if they cover about Fifteen to twenty miles per day could take anywhere from sixty to eighty days well that would be after mid term\nWho knows what's gonna happen\nWho knows what's going to happen at this point\nAn edge to march up to the border and demand entry that's not going to work and if it if it ends up being five to seven thousand\nAre they going to try to break through like what we saw\nBecause I've heard some people say that looks like an invasion and you know what their rights\nAgain you could have stopped and sought amnesty in Mexico\nBut they didn't want to wait for that they just wanted immediately go in\nAnd then they didn't want to stay there there's going to go to the United states is it about him is do\nYou have to ask that question legitimately is it really about intimacy because you don't have to go all the way to the United states\nAnd apparently some in the caravan included the number of deportees deportees who have some experience with all of it\nBecause apparently now there's a second caravan that's formed in Honduras\nAnd they've already crossing the Guatemalan they're going to catch up to the main group that is now in Mexico\nTraveling with them as a man named Anthony ... says they twenty nine year old who was deported six times his last time just five months ago\nAnd so he's with marching and he's apparently advising people\nHow do you mean that's the thing what they're what people are going to want to do is they're going to want to have a stand off at the border\nAnd I think that they would\nTime it to be I I don't know after a while it's going to happen after midterms by the time they end up getting there\nI Do think that there are Democrats at once the optics of\nHaving that stand off at the border because can you go overboard can you overplay their hand\nThere's going to they're going to be some people who are going to I mean if you put a military response on the border to prevent the sort of storming of the gates is what we saw from Guatemala and Mexico you're going to have that optic and I'm gonna tell you what you're going to have Democrats are going to be campaigning on that forever but that doesn't mean Republicans should shy away from doing the right thing and protecting America sovereignty\nYou don't have the right to demand entry into someone else's home no nor do you have the right to demand in trenches someone an end to another country you just simply do not no matter what there is a legal process and you disrespect the country you disrespect the people in it by ignoring the legal process to enter the that particular sovereign entity\nAnd that's all there is to it it is a massive sign of disrespect it is a sign that says you cannot be trusted it is a sign that shows that you do not want to be in good faith enter the country and be a part of this you know the citizenry family that's what it showcases\nAnd sovereign entity doesn't have to let every person it\nThey don't have to let anyone it it's a sovereign entity\nThe rules of the sovereign entity are not dictated by forces or people outside\nI mean Republicans should shy away from doing the right thing and protecting America sovereignty\nYou don't have the right to demand entry into someone else's home no nor do you have the right to demand in trenches someone an end to another country you just simply do not no matter what there is a legal process and you disrespect the country you disrespect the people in it by ignoring the legal process to enter the that particular sovereign entity\nAnd that's all there is to it it is a massive sign of disrespect it is a sign that says you cannot be trusted it is a sign that shows that you do not want to be in good faith into the country and be a part of that you know the citizenry family that's what it showcases\nAnd its sovereign entity doesn't have to let every person it\nThey don't have to let anyone in its sovereign entity\nThe rules of the sovereign entity are not dictated by forces or people outside\nAnd this is this is it this is being used as political capitals what it is\nAnd I don't see any Democrats trying to just wait any of these individuals from undertaking it's very dangerous twelve hundred plus mile journey to the southern border going through cartel country\nWhere people go missing constantly and no one ever stops to search for them because it's just too dangerous where cops or even killed there was one story about a border town well it was close to a border town that was in cartel country where the sheriff was murdered and a female took over because she was done with the crime and she became share of all they killed her to\nAnd this is all for what Democrats want the optic they want the optic of a Republican president and then they're going to make they're going to make comparisons to\nCivil rights when a who was at a Bull Connor they're going to make comparisons to bulk up they're going to do all of that stuff\nI guarantee you that is what they're going to do that's what the plan is\nYou're going to have him go down there for a photo ops all of that stuff it is going to be a huge thing\nAnd they're going to try to make those individuals who think that everyone should enter legally because of the country has the right to know who is entering to make sure that you don't have bad characters and drain they're going to make those individuals look awful\nStarted that's what the goal is going to be in the media is going to work overtime to help them and how that did this depends on what happened during midterms\nIt all depends on what happens with midterms\nSo coming out there's more NFL anthem drama there

that\nWas invented by the white man sure which one we're not going to believe in it any more I\nDon't know I'm just like on a social justice warriors and who knows I literally have a story about how

um generous see it's so easy\n[noise]\nYeah you okay All right over there\nAnd it's just so ridiculous I mean it's literally the definition it's more about the feelings are are superseding facts like that so far the leftist grabs on to feelings instead of fat and this is the problem\nHere's the thing and then I Know we've got we've got some bills to say but you don't want to have you don't want science to follow politics and you don't want\nPeople to there has to be there has to be a legal standard\nNow you can do everything around that long as you're not foreseen individuals against their

weeks now uh because I was in the hospital for a period of time and it's an interesting story because all of my life or not all my life in later years when I was more competitive athlete and I'm\nReally was retired at a very early age I didn't have a lot to do uh I picked up the habit of drinking alcohol\nAnd I'll I'll never affected me quite the way does everybody else I was able to drink get drunk get up the next day and go to work and do whatever I Need to do or get up and and survive I never had hangovers I'd never really had any problem but I just came to the conclusion that\nAll right this is stifling me in some way shape or form\nAnd always talk to people about why do you smoke why do this why are you that while you that whatever and I just wondered what would be on the other side about drinking so I decided to stop drinking lo and behold when I stopped drinking what happened was you know your body is used to getting all that sugar each side as you said I have a glass of wine\nOr your drink whatever it is you sit back relax and your body goes off thank you I needed that\nRelax or so when I stopped drinking I and I just stopped cold turkey and people said do you know you should do something about drinking maybe goes somewhere look let me tell you something I don't know what's right for you what wrong for you or whatever but\nWhen people told me I should stop drinking I said I Am not going to go to a real quick because that's sick people and they're sick people teaching people to be sick\nThey're telling you that you are sick\nConclusion that All

drinking I said I Am not going to go to a rehab clean because that's sick\nPeople and they're sick people teaching sick people they'd be sick they're telling you that you are sick they're telling you that you have a problem that you can't overcome that problem and that your goal for the rest of your life is to get up every day and not drink\nThat is not my goal I stopped drinking multiple times in my life where I just because people say you drink too much what is it OK outside of ... and I just stop\nAnd I've stopped now for three weeks and I didn't have any kind of a reaction to it whatsoever

successful in my brain goes a thousand miles an hour goes twenty four seven\nI Can't sleep in fact when I stopped drinking I went three days in a row\nWhere I slept one hour at night\nThat was the one side of that 'cause I couldn't sleep because there was nothing there is no downers in my system to take me down and it never bothered me the next day was up I didn't feel like I didn't sleep it's a weird we're deal now what am I told you all this because when I went to them just as a couple of things like to hear it out over the last two weeks\nAnd one of them is is that too many of us believe that were helpless\nAnd that we we're cripples that we needed crutch and that just isn't true\nYou know I'm sure there's somebody out there is going to sit still you're crazy you have had these rehab clinics you have to have these twelve step programs guys I was doing it three to five bottles of wine and night I stopped cold turkey\nThat was at\nThe bottom line is people drank not because they need the alcohol\nYes eventually your body starts to crave the outcome I used to get the five o'clock cravings is like my fiancee would always laughing because it's five o'clock\nHalf which meant yep I find if I get to five o'clock and I could get a drink and boom Saul okay everything's fine but the ... it was all they ever got ... I I Know people to get up in the morning and start drinking vodka them they get out of bed\nRight this is a different kind of alcoholism\nBut it still comes down to the weakness of the mind because I look at like my daughter had alcoholism for a while she went and got treatment or got help now she's a competitive bodybuilder she's on a national stage she's and ripped to shreds the shape of her life there's no\nThere's no you are an alcoholic you are a loser you are this you or that and yet we let people believe that about themselves what I'm trying to tell you is\nThe problem you really have is you really have nothing in like the reason I started drinking 'cause I had already made all my money I had already won all my body building contest and already done everything that I wanted to do my bucket list in life had been checked off and there was nothing left me to do get up\nGot each I I Know people to get up in the morning and started breeding vodka them they get out of bed\nRight this is a different kind of alcoholism\nBut it still comes down to the weakness of the mind because I look at like my daughter had alcoholism for a while she went and got treatment or got help now she's a competitive bodybuilder she's on a national stage she's and ripped to shreds the shape of her life there's no\nThere's no you are an alcoholic you are a loser you are this you or that and yet we let people believe that about themselves what I'm trying to tell you is\nThe problem you really have is you really have nothing in like the reason I started drinking 'cause they've already made all my money I'd already won all my body building contest and already done everything that I wanted to do my bucket list in life had been checked off\nAnd there was nothing left me to do get up in a day do my radio shows and get back to society go to a few events where I Would help and talk to people in teaching motivate whatever it was it the rest of my life is really nothing for it I I work in my garden and I've got you know giant yard I spend most of my time working on but the point is is that\nI decided to stop\nAnd just see what happens how many of you can just stop doing this stupid stuff you're doing like paying off your mortgage like putting money in a four O. one K. U. R. blindly addicted to the stupid financial stuff that you're doing as well as most people who are addicted to alcohol and drugs you can't stop yourself\nWe had a seminar out in uh Las Vegas and I got an email back when people are like oh my God you can't expect us to stop contributing four one K. you can't expect just take our money out of our four one K. you can't expect us to not have our home paid in full I don't know do you are drunk on a date Ramsey\nYou're out of your mind drug up on somebody else's belief systems because those belief systems do not work and will not work towards becoming financially free and especially rich wealthy\nAbove and beyond the average person and so as like dropped off in this alcohol which is interesting was is that I started eating something at night that I've never eaten before I started getting like fruit nuts and stuff stuff that we normally think is healthy\nBut what I realized as all that stuff this is a kind of stuff that irritates something called dire ridiculous or something like that ... stomach disease and the test and disease or there's Powell ups and stuff and all that stuff got hit by somebody and all of a sudden I had diverted ... a um [noise]\nEvent you know it hurt and it hurt really bad so I went to the hospital the emergency room and they took X rays and said yeah you've got to hold your test\nAnd so now I'm sitting here in the hospital for six days ... massive medication like living on water liquid diet jello that kind of stuff [laughter]\nI'm just sitting there going like you know number one I'm so happy they don't have to worry about my business as my money my finances or whatever that I had the time and the energy to be able to take care of stuff like this\nBut once it was gone once I got out of it they sent me home I got a tube and my stomach I'll be getting it out soon but it's a drain to train all of the infected materials out of my body and all kinds of antibiotics\nBut I feel great don't get me wrong I mean I\nCould run a mile right now I'm back to the doctor said I've been over achiever said you're you'd be feel better if you get up and walk a little bit so did I Do I Do like twenty five laps around the whole wing\nOf the hospital I mean there's the athlete in the right you can see me running or walking with holding my you know the thing that the stuff into your arm you know I'm rolling it and I'm walking around like try to do it fast like trying to get some exercise and right and\nAnd my finances or whatever that I had the time and energy to be able to take care of stuff like this but what it was gone once I got out of it they sent me home I got a tube and my stomach I'll be getting it out too but it's a drain to train all the inspected materials out of my body model that about\nBut I feel great don't get me wrong I mean I could run a mile right now back to the doctor said I've been over the bridge that you're you'd be feel better if you get up and walk a little bit so what did I Do I Do like twenty five laps around the whole wing\nOf the hospital I mean there's the athlete in Iraq you can see me running or walking with holding my you know the thing is the stuff into your arm you know I'm rolling it and I'm walking around like try to do it fast like try to get some exercise that right\nThen I decided to get rid of the hundred houses start buying apartment complexes and I bought small apartment complex\nI remember having attenuated apartment complex was making me two thousand dollars a month I was making two hundred dollars a month and each unit will see two hundred a month types and those two thousand dollars a month twenty four thousand a year tax free\nIt was phenomenal I did almost nothing to run the stand your it was simple\nAnd I was making additional two thousand dollars a month ... then I went out and bought myself a from the twenty I went and bought a thirty unit the thirty unit was making me tremendous amount of money three thousand four thousand bucks a month something like that or an hour was making more money\nYou know tax free that I was making you know ever at my job by double\nThen I went on about a forty unit and make some money and then I went and bought a sixty sixty four unit which really the that was the criminal the crown that was the turning point for everything the sixty four unit was making me about ten thousand dollars a month by itself forget about all the other stuff\nThis one property I put a hundred and fifty thousand dollars down to buy that today you'd probably have to put\nProbably five hundred thousand dollars down to buy that property [noise] um but I bought it and after I bought that one I bought the one across the street and I bought the one next to it and then I bought two of them around the corner so here I was\nMaking like fifty thousand dollars a month with five apartment complex was phenomenal\nIt was phenomenal just money was just rolling and it was tax free money right there it was boom boom boom boom boom just rocket\nAnd at that point that says you know I pretty much quit in my brain I'm making more money than I ever ever ever dreamed of making when I was a kid I thought about making a hundred grand a year my dad never made a hundred grand a year that was going to be the ... and here I was making fifty grand about tax free\nAnd I really I didn't know where to go from there I read books I tried to hang out with people like try to get ideas but really I was so far ahead of everybody I knew that I had nobody to really lead me to the next level to where I should go\nRight and then at life\nThousand dollars a month with five apartment complex was phenomenal it was phenomenal just money was just rolling and it was tax free\nMoney right there it was a boom boom boom boom boom just rocket\nAnd at that point that says you know I pretty much quit in my brain I'm making more money than I ever ever ever dreamed of making when I was a kid I thought about making a hundred grand a year my dad never made a hundred grand a year that was going to be the criminal to cram and here I was making fifty grand about tax free\nAnd I really I didn't know where to go from there I read books I tried to hang out with people like try to get ideas but really I was so far ahead of everybody I knew that I had nobody to really lead me to the next level to where I should go\nRight and then\nAt lifestyles mentoring all these people some people came in that were way more aggressive I lost my edge\nI had decided that it was over the season of my life was my growth was over that's the seasons and I was living it [noise]\nI had more real estate anybody else in the group ah had prestige people knew me I was doing seminars um I was on the radio and everything seemed like okay you've arrived\nWithin some guys came in and started buying way more real estate than I did one guy came in about two hundred and forty units are in one apartment then a couple of months later bought four hundred eighty units and all of a sudden the guy was\nHad more units and I did\nAnd then he bought a portfolio and just went on and on people's just start following these guys and buy more and more and more and more real estate\nAnd I'm thinking wow this is incredible but wait\nI'm totally happy I shouldn't worry about the fact that these guys are making more money and buy more properties than I Am ... why should I even care and and rationally myself I don't care I'm not greedy I don't care what these guys do I like helping people make more money than me but one day somewhere along the line the season of my life changed\nAnd I said you know the only reason why I don't want to go out there and do all this is because I just don't want to do it all I'm at that point in my life where I've locked down it's simple\nSo what I did was I went out and found a guy and you guys know ms John Johnny Lama rich way and I taught him out of working in corporate America he was vice president second largest management company of the country I said look why did you come to lifestyles\nAnd I will set you up a portfolio properties all by them you manage them will be partners in the deal\nAnd then you'll be able to give up your job because you need income I Will produce a job for you income for you and he agreed to do it took me about two years to get him into the place but then we went out we bought for apartment complexes in a row\nAnd daresay were destroyed with these apartment complexes my whole image of how much money can be made completely changed I made more money in four years\nThat I had made in forty years previous to that because now I was doing this not only from my own self satiation\nBut for John in all of our partners in everybody else's involved and I thought man I got to go out there and do something we gotta do something big and we got out there and the excitement most actual here I Am I'm In a new season of my life\nI'm now a syndicator I'm now playing big I'm trying to keep up with the big boys I'm running the big giant deals and we bought a hundred and forty two hundred and fifty six hundred two hundred Seventy three hundred twenty unit so we just kept growing and growing\nAnd growing and growing now during that time we made\nMy whole image of how much money can be made completely changed I made more money for years that I had made in forty years previous to that because now I was doing this not only from my own self satiation\nBut for John ... all of our partners in everybody else's involved and I thought man I got to go out there do something we gotta do something big we got out there and the excitement moved back here I Am I'm In a new season of my life\nI'm now a syndicator I'm now playing big I'm trying to keep up with the big boys I'm running the big giant deals\nAnd we bought a hundred and forty year to two hundred and fifty six hundred two hundred Seventy ... three hundred twenty so we just kept growing and growing\nAnd growing and growing now during that time we made some aspect of it today\nI right now by about four properties this year so far about up trying to buy my fifth one right now and I was looking in my personal financial state but and I just looked at this and it just blew my mind\nAbout how credible\nThe money made on these properties where and when we come back from the break 'cause I don't want to short\nA short this thing I Want to go to go into a show you we made so much money\nIn a ... year period of time or whatever it was I don't know what it was two thousand two thousand uh let's see we got a sixteen about eight years made so much money that you're just blow your mind and that was an additional season of my life\nAnd it wasn't until that season was over

financial world works is\nIt gives you the ability to build an income to build wealth for yourself or your family your church synagogue jump or whatever it may be\nBut you can do that without having to get caught up in all of the the viciousness that has become the system but I Do want to talk a little bit of politics today simply because\nIt it how it's going to I think potentially affect the market and could potentially affect the market in a very great way I'm going to take a step back\nTo ... I remember it was an August and I'm thinking it was two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about how people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications\nAnd what you found back then was there were only two groups in and this was before ... and by the way some remember that part of it or whatever that you know few months before that so they rate\nI look at the sheer vitriol and hatred on both sides\nIn what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Ford and all the rest of it and I don't care which is fine to that argument Iran first of all if you believe firmly believe one side or the other ... you have to realize we don't really have a lot of facts okay\nAnd you can say well then that means ... that means y understand all that\nBut real lined the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and they will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned I have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong but if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years\n... and Dr Ford and all the rest of it and I don't care which side to that argument Iran first of all if you both firmly believe one side or the other ... you have to realize we don't really have a lot of facts okay and you can say well then that means ... that means y understand all that\nBut real lined the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and it will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned I have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if that were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives are going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment therefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash\nAnd the idea this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach\nBut the idea of this is before the market goes down you gotta know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up but\nThe average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors well defined investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders real life that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue with gamble\nThey put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong and again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly\nIf you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of games think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay\nIf you want Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down then you can on the move up so again in classroom and talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked winter like four okay you know you have your ... to camp to extend your are your uh see the eyes and you know there's a vote for thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got they won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weather\nWe're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people will focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators\nIf this really worked winter like four okay you know you have your ... to camp sticks in your are your ah see the eyes and ears on hold for thousands or hundreds of these things right so how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecasters really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter] okay [laughter]\nAnd that's a lot of this is that people accused something because it's the best they think they've got but\nIt's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things are really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market it's supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make this a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing\nAs opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to be teaching this

on confidence it also means that his ability to continue to cut taxes and regulation again you may think those are bad things\nBut those things have helped the market we have to realize that all of that is at risk of changing pretty quickly\nSo that the classroom it'd be teaching and by the way it totally aside from that there's some other things out there right now that indicate that the market may well be near the top\nWe're getting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes but the to me the key is you have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad is it happens way too fast and you can't react in time\nYou've got to be position before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the S. and P. gave back Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to two thousand level\nThat was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years and people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investment horizon it's thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years and you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside\nThat's very very hard for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices which big institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at you know when he was buying apple a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five\nThat would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think\nFat these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to two thousand level\nAnd that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years and people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investment horizon it's thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years and you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside\nThat's very very hard for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you begin institutions like Goldman Sachs for people like Warren Buffett are buying at you know when he was buying apple it a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five\nThat would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and that will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was fine apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how do I want to actually make money when the stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is that they invest in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because\nTheir markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself yes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have laws okay\nIf you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay\nAnd my dad's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I've ... I've taught this class before it's always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those will be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThat the world has changed in my opinion from a marketing a RINO manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you could always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at it charged with looking it indicators which are the wrong thing\nThere's a fundamental we'd better approach again that I was teaching class so if you want to come out you can get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that T.

new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hardest time of the day between three and ... and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest some of the day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way to the analogy of the people like like that I've been told is remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate\nWith our telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would beat they were making money hand over fist met her when we called made long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars and forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars um it it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill all walk on that if you are right plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's criminal um I see that the power companies thank you [laughter] I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I ...\nA hundred and eighty nine dollars um it it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's

Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you any more\nSo you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go off\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them and I explain all this to them\nSo not only are you paying between seven and a half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying towards the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people there is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus the electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\nIt it just it doesn't make sense for them they can you raise everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he'll go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site ... I Do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again\nAnd I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us that has been hearing us for a year year and a half\nAnd then the natives out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time and\nIt does make sense for them they can you raise everybody should just call you just find out how to read their bill and then I don't know how to read their ... and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he goes why didn't I Do the sooner I write so many people who will say that on my show all the time [noise]\nIt's I ... I Do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again\nAnd I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half and today there is out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now you understand what she rains\nAnd so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol I'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer peas rate punch today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home will use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid the power company\nCut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well here's what we're\nGoing to do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really should just give recall she does a free consultation she's raised with the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it six to three\nEight five zero eight two two nine she want you to go up on her website it is ask solar Sandy dot com go to ... make sure it's ... dot com\nFill out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for today you know\nIt it's the simplest is you know I really am on the mission and when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time due to my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life because I financially wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful then she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the than I was able to help them understand that my daughter was able to help them understand it\nSo now it's about I'm there to educate\nIt gives people the the information so that they can make an informed decision about their own power costs they wouldn't let somebody else choose their host what kind of payment they could afford for mortgage they wouldn't let somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe it's just they just haven't got the information yet but let's get Hugh Hugh with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power cause\nShe's valley wide it's no obligation free consultation to you out there she had lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone the number to call her direct it is area code six to three eight five zero eight two two nine go on that website and check out the ... seats\nIn my daughter was able to help them understand it\nSo now it's a doubt I'm there to educate\nIt gives people the the information so that they can make an informed decision about their own power caught it wouldn't let somebody else choose their host what kind of payment they could afford for mortgage they wouldn't let somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people until\nMaybe they just haven't got the information yeah but let's get you the right information you can make an informed decision about your ... she's valley wide it said no obligation free consultation to you out there she has lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone\nThe number to call her direct idiots area code six to three eight five zero eight two two nine go on that website and check out the ... ... it's ask felt solar Sandy dot com\n\nHigh so it's handy here currently you're buying power from your company's paying\nFees taxes and all kinds of target electricity I Want you to save money on bill you're already spending too much on and it's going to keep going up to get to see any with silver ... my ... and then I come to your health I mean how many times do you mean and how much ... meet your\nPower will save you know more high electricity [noise] it's really funny now you reduce your own hours Taylor or\nAnd a clear as you up to do what you need John but it's still going along with your business so it's a perfect for us for our business someone like that as a perfect joint venture partner\nRight RJ was another person that was a perfect venture partner\nMake we love our J.

now you're starting to make money you're starting to move along you're you're increasing your income\nAnd you don't have time to do your social media you don't have time to answer every question you want to social media Gore oh you want bought into Cheryl Anne RJ come after and that's the flow of doing JD partnership who do my clients need before they see me\nWho might my clients need after they see me or even while they're working with me\nAnd I want to clarify something also um\nBecause we do a lot of networking we go to a referral group to go to leave for his regarding networking group to go to social networking a band and\nI think there's a difference but we want to\nPut in place or or make people understand the difference between just giving somebody a referral for networking and actually having a JV partnership with them because one way or another there is compensation in there it's not just hey I'm a networking king or queen I'm going to just keep referring you there's compensation is a two way street\nSo keep that in mind also when you're thinking about this\nAnd and now that's not to say that\nIf you know a great attorney and you're you don't have a a formal arrangement with them you're not going to refer of course you're going to refer or maybe this is something you do often you do talk to that attorney and say I don't mind it not be the best one I don't think they are allowed to but uh an accountant let's say\nYou refer to an account ... you might want to talk to and say hey I refer a lot of people you can we do something to formalized best because I'd love to compensate you for sending referrals my way\nAnd you were compensate for referring people for referring people your way so again that's when when when we're talking about\nIn state right into the compensation which doesn't always have to be monetary remember that people compensation\nSo keep in mind also when you're thinking about this\nAnd and now that's not to say that\nIf you know a great attorney and you're you don't have a a formal arrangement with them you're not going to refer of course you're going to refer or maybe if this is something you often you do talk to that attorney and say that mind it but not be the best one I don't think they are allowed to but uh an accountant let's say\nYou refer to an account ... you might want to talk to and say hey I refer a lot of people you can we do something to form a wise because I'd love to compensate you for joining referrals my way\nAnd you will compensate for referring people for me referring people your way so again that's when when when we're talking about\nIt's the right it's the compensation which doesn't always have to be monetary remember that people compensation not always have to be monitored it may be referrals it may be saying hey you know what I refer a lot of business you and I know your clients really don't\nNeed my products or services or they're not my ideal client however you know how I work you've worked with me would you mind during a video for me would you mind you know something sharing a\nAn email whatever it is that the JV partnership where you're doing a joint venture\nThere are other types of JD partnerships as well the easiest of course being\nHuman needs Facebook Live video and there's no monetary compensation there is one to one it so I'm going to give you this week and share you with my audience you interviewed me next week and share me with your money and that's the one to one or the compensation there's so many other JD partnership\nI think the biggest one in the industry with coaches and teachers and trainers is when you do a lot\nNow launches when you've got a new product or service out there and you want to get that information out to as many people as as possible and so when you you will launch you want to set up a really good JD partnership when we come back from the break we're going to talk a little bit about doing a launch\nUsing other people's

ballot and battleground districts that's not good for Democrats what's going on with a ... and Cruz that's not good what's going on in Arizona that's not good ... there's just a ton and then of course it all started with Elizabeth Warren\nThinking that she won I mean she really thought she was coming out with this story to show that she is American indian she ends a Native American pie and it's not just by high cheekbones took my genealogy just it could be as little as one one thousand twenty fourth Native American to which everybody so wait what what\nThat is less than the average immigrant

just a tiny bit further I don't know if we can but he says you know you know Elizabeth Warren she may run I Hope she does and and then if we had a debate in the middle of the debate so he's setting it all up with these hypothetical\nAnd they're claiming that he said he would give her a million dollars if you did this test no not really\nAll you're splitting hairs no not really the whole thing with the hypothetical that he was talking about in a rally kidding around but even if you took him one hundred percent literally the point was if she ran for president and there was a debate he would then

uh you know to turn ... coming home to roost really became popular usage country when a war church or all the phony American Indiana University of\nColorado wrote a paper about uh nine eleven

Indian charge without ours got he's not one\nI remember that were the Indian tribes there they they said that no they don't they're not claiming him and it again it goes to this whole thing of identity politics this idea that because of your DNA or who your great great great grandmother was changes\nWho you are and how valuable you are just doesn't make sense that's not how we do it in America so it'd be like saying hey your dad was a serial murderer therefore you are a horrible person we don't do that right um but we do in front of the things\nLet's say that you were a great great great great grandfather was a slave owner that's your fault\nBut let's say your great great great great grandfather freed the slaves is not your fault or is that something that you should uh I didn't mean to a fault of the opposite right [laughter] that's something you should get credit for\nNo you get credit for what you do in the United states of America it's supposed to be a merit based society

that the way to not discriminate on the color is to treat everyone the same now they're saying if you treat everyone the same that's discriminatory\nThat's how crazy this world is going its upside down inside out bizarro world and I was also telling you about that that live with one is not the only problem story for the Democrats\nHave what we go to this this is from ABC News and or ... no I'm Sorry yeah it is yeah sorry Washington Post ABC poll\nGeneric ballot in battleground districts the ones that really count the battleground districts where it's kind of you know we don't know who's gonna win look we all know in the house everybody in the house is up for election every two years right\nAnd we all know there are certain districts that are definitely going to be Republican and there are certain districts that are definitely going to be Democrats I mean it doesn't matter you know the ours gonna win in this district the ... going to win this district and it doesn't really matter who the names are\nAnd then we get to the ones that are battleground districts where it's gone up for grabs we're not sure who's gonna win this one and that's where the movement happens in the house of representatives so this Washington Post ABC News poll looked at those battleground districts\nAnd on the generic ballot right you vote for Republican or Democrat the Republicans are up one\nWay it's written on what kind of my wife is a part\nOf the Republicans are up on ABC News Rick Klein took a look at this\nDouble digit Democrat lead nationwide\nMake everybody think in the far left area and the and the media and the Democrat but our ... myself that it's going to be this blue wave but when you got to look at is where the real battles are so here's a Klein says for twenty two

percent approval rating Democrats have a fifty three to forty two percent edge in the generic ballot for the house but you go to the districts that are toss ups the sixty six districts\nThe lead

to be really cool\nReally do you think so I\nHave five five hundred Savage you get you on board the program a five five four hundred Savage and you're on board\nAnd have you been paying attention to the stuff that the hurricanes okay I live in Florida so when I hear this stuff about the hurricanes and I'm being told that they are getting bigger more intense and there's more of them because of global warming I said what and when I saw President Trump on the Leslie stall on Sunday\nI said well I Wish somebody brief President Trump because the truth is there is no trend of more hurricanes on the planet there is no trend of more intense hurricanes on the planet I don't care what the so called experts are telling you and when Lesley Stahl said what scientists are saying that's not true he should have said\nRoy Spencer PHD\nBecause Roy Spencers been studying this stuff for a long time he's a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama Huntsville he's written in visible inevitable disaster why hurricanes cannot be blamed on global warming and global warming skepticism for busy people\nAnd he does it with facts from our own government and he's ... he's got this out inconvenient data no trend in Florida hurricane strikes\nAnd he's just updated a plot of Florida major hurricane strikes that he's been doing it and it follows hurricane strikes since Nineteen hundred and it includes hurricane Michael\nAnd here's what he found no trend in either intensity or frequency of hurricane strikes over the last one hundred and Eighteen years and he uses National Hurricane center data to do it he's not making up the data like so many in the global warming movement does do excuse me\nSays the trend line for intensity is flat the trend line in number of storms is downward but it's in significant\nBut it is downward not offered so there is no data that shows there are more hurricanes and there is no data that the hurricanes are intensifying if you look at real data and you look at it over a real period of time and not just the window you want to cherry pick\nBoy the Gulf of Mexico is unusually warm so expensive\nThose hurricane strikes since Nineteen hundred and it includes hurricane Michael and here's what he found no trend in either intensity or frequency of\nHurricane strikes over the last one hundred and Eighteen years and he uses National Hurricane center data to do it he's not making up the data like so many in the global warming movement does do excuse me\nSays the trend line for intensity is flat the trend line in number of storms is downward but it's in significant\nBut it is downward not up word so there is no data that shows there are more hurricanes and there is no data that the hurricanes are intensifying if you look at real data and you look at it over a real period of time and not just the window you want to cherry pick\nBoyd the Gulf of Mexico is unusually warm so Spencer point that well yeah but if you look at the history of July August September average the temperature\nYou'll see that since Eighteen sixty this summer\nIs only the ninth warmest in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and other top ten warmest Gulf here since Eighteen sixty seven occurred both for Nineteen Seventy which is both for we experienced any significant warming\nWell but we're going to get more of these really\nMajor hurricanes are part of nature Spencer points out and he looked at lake bottom sediment in western like in the Florida Panhandle very close to where Michael Bay landfall and he said over the last one thousand years it's been relatively quiet for cat four and five hurricanes but\nFrom one thousand two thousand years ago there was a hyperactive period of intense land falls in the Florida Panhandle in other words there's been time in this plant history where there have\nBeen more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes in Florida than there are today or long before so called global warming\n\nBy the way the latest hurricane experts who claim that there are more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes\n\nThat is going on in this country we all did not see what happened in Portland, Oregon because it was blacked out by the wonderful people in the media will give you fake news on a daily basis\nThey did that show you the communist flags the Palestinian flags did that show you who's underneath those maps were twenty foot

will be given to Honduras affective immediately know word\nOr from the president of Honduras or Mexican officials\nAre member last time when this happened in April and may Mexico just let him walk right on through no word yet as to what the the Mexican officials will do\nOur U.S Department of homeland security said today that uh what we see day in and day out at the border is a result of well advertise and well known catch and release loopholes we cannot allow it to happen you will recall and I need to say this\nDon't get angry at me\nPresident Trump made a similar threat back in April with the last caravan\nPresident Trump last time when a couple of thousand of them came up he threatened to withdraw aid from Honduras or that never happened and the uh the migrants the illegals reached our southern border\nWe can't let that happen again\nAnd if Mexico is not going to cooperate and then they will probably make it to our border\nBut that doesn't mean we have to let him in\nAnd let's hope this time or the Trump Administration sticks to that let me go to Greg Greg\nHey Joe I was just going to say a couple of things first of all if someone thinking asylum right\nYeah the idea is they're fleeing from something like violent yes if the violence on jurors when they reach Guatemala they've already found is Iowa thank you right\nThat's really what they're looking for is not asylum they're looking for a to come to a place where there's more of fluid nothing wrong with that I don't blame them but that's what they're looking to do\nAnd don't buy the only Greg Greg I'll give you can point but just to back up your first point Guatemala again has said they will not provide asylum to these people\nRight out of the matter is you know if\nIt if there were another\nWealthy country between us and you cannot mandate what you ought there exactly right yeah they're just coming here because we're in a wealthy country it's not because they they've they've already escaped the violence when they get to whatever the next country is that they're not quite right yeah\nBut look I don't blame if people I mean our life is not good they want to get to a better place at the same point a Trump can threaten the same thing again Guatemala and Mexico but he did get found it they let the caravan continue toward our border he can pull funding from Guatemala and Mexico but\nHe's got to do something you're right because we\nThey will not provide asylum to these people\nRight exactly how does it matter you know if it if there were another wealthy country between us and you have this caravan they went\nOut there exactly right\nYeah they're just coming here because we're in a wealthy country it's not because they they've ... they've already escape the violence when they get to whatever the next country is that they're not quite right yeah\nBut look I don't blame me for people I mean our life is not good they want to get to a better place at the same point a Trump can threaten the same thing again Guatemala and Mexico but he did get founder and they let the caravan continue toward our border he can pull funding from Guatemala and Mexico but\nHe's got to do something you're right because we can't just let everyone in the world who wants to come to the U.S in the U.S it just it won't work\nThank you Greg it just it well it won't work and it's not right there are\nWays to seek asylum and it's not proper to just you win a thousand to your best friends just come walking across or crawling across our border\n\nNow everybody got upset about this when this happened at the end of April in early may this past year and the Trump Administration talked tough man but most of them mentally came in we cannot let that happen again let me go to Steve

how many other what will say quote unquote pro life groups are you aware of in the valley doing similar things there about fifty in the state of Arizona okay so we can do some multiplication here yeah\nMore than a million people probably year reaching out to these locations collectively then that's not to mention things that we don't even know about because our our\nAt play appear to say they discuss all the options to\nThese women clinics women's clinics to locations seventh street just north of life of coffee at ... and thirty Fifth Avenue and ... which kind of talking about this encounter of\nWhere here in the valley and particularly the needed so great and just the numbers that we talked about in this first little bit here\nSeven thousand a year so yes I mean that's that's huge and how many other what will say quote unquote pro life groups are you aware of in the valley doing similar things there about fifty in the state of Arizona okay so we can do the multiplication here yeah\nMore than a million people probably year reaching out to these locations collectively and that's not to mention things that we don't even know about because our our\nAt play appear to say they discuss all the options to ride I mean there may be people who actually looking for\nThings that don't get answered there I mean it would be\nAt least best anecdotally to say that\nPlanned Parenthood not pushing adoption or\nStaying at home with your mom and having the baby you know they're probably not pushing those options right\nYeah I remember a story woman came in to me and um she said she was considering abortion and ... we did the pregnancy tests and sat down and said ... kind of going over abortion with her and she looked at me and said well I don't really want an abortion I thought if I said that\nYou wouldn't be trying to talk me into it so she [laughter] said had that experience and I abortion clinic where she said she was going to have the baby and they tried to pressure hurts have an abortion so she's like oh I just I just wanted to avoid that conversations I just put down an abortion\n[laughter] well that's an interesting dynamic right so\nI Know we've heard over the years you know I've been involved in this my whole adult life\nSo I don't know thirty\nActively involve myself\nYou here in numbers like or or things like the numbers of surgical abortions are going down across the country\nI don't know what the facts are but it seems to me I could hypothesize that the numbers of chemical abortions\nAre rapidly increasing in sort of an inverted curve against that decline and surgical abortions would you agree with that\nLet's say ... ... the Bush and held more common in probably increasing um yeah but most states count both kinds of abortions and those have dropped a little bit in uptown and then they searched\nAnd a little bit um we think they're reporting it Stan skewed skewed a little bit ... inaccurate\nWell when I was going to drive out here before we are going to go to the break is about and they are just in the next few minutes\nThere's been a lot of great progress in\nUh the reverse of the argue forty six\nIn particular you know and I don't know if there's any women listening tonight or family members you know women that\nAre considering already forty six or have recently very recently taken already forty six but there's a way to reverse that now\nThat is correct and we did that at our clinics\nRight and I wanted to bring that up because\nEverybody's human being you know everybody falls and makes mistakes or even have lapses in judgment I myself with the greatest among them but\nThere is hope even in these instances right and I think that's the great message of having the whole mobile clinic ride how does that work I and I I Want to get to the clinic's ... after the break too but very briefly two minutes or less how does that pill reversal work and how\nWell the sooner the better um\nThe reverse of the argue forty six\nIn particular you know and I don't know if there's any women listening tonight or family members you know women that are considering already forty six or have recently very recently taken already forty six but there's a way to reverse that now\nThat's correct and we did that at our clinics\nRight and I wanted to bring that up because\nEverybody's human being you know everybody falls and makes mistakes or even have lapses in judgment I myself with the greatest among them but\nThere is hope even in these instances right and I think that's the great advantage of having the whole mobile clinic right how does that work I and I I Want to get to the clinic's ... after the break too but very briefly two minutes or less how does that pill reversal work and how\nHow soon as they have to be done well the sooner the better um the sweet spot is within twelve hours in what women will say often is as soon as they saw that abortion pill they had regrets and of course if they can throw it out that's great\nBut I'm the fortune ... cutoff nutrients to the pregnancy okay that will kill the pregnancy someone when we come in and they're trying to do the reverse of what we did the sound\nAnd sometimes we see that heartbeat very very rapid and that's the baby fighting for flights while and then we sent slowing down and it gets soaring summer until it stops\n... said the gesture and can feed the pregnancy projection is a medication\nThat she is for women who've had multiple miscarriages sometimes to help\nYou get more nutrients that pregnancy and so when a woman send the abortion pill reversal will give her\n... that she will take 'em for the first twelve weeks of pregnancy to make sure that pregnancy gets proper nutrition\nSo that's pretty amazing it's amazing that fifty percent of women who do the abortion poll reversal babies survive\nWow that's an amazing statistic is well you guys see a lot of those cases\nWe don't see a huge number but um yeah we do see a few and it's amazing and we've got to\nBabies are alive who were born in\n... that mind boggling yeah do you guys have a I have no shame fully I've been to the mobile clinic but I haven't been in in to the physical plant\nOr do you guys have all the pictures on the wall babies or anything like that now know we take privacy of our patients very seriously I mean just the babies will be super fuel or just like little representations and they\nCome visit her off [laughter] no I mean obviously there\nWere a nice calendar [laughter] wouldn't that be nice to have like some kind of like a pin and every location I don't know something to say look at all these people it was the goal is encouragement\nYeah well you know we had some women tell their stories and we do get written permission to tell some stories but um for the most part um you know women in these situations really want their privacy\nI understand that makes total sense it's the Bruce diction show live at the life of coffee studios in about a thirty seconds we're going to go to a break and get some news is probably our on our host am eleven hundred K. if an ex the valleys independent talk radio and uh I hear the music but most me and I need to go pretty soon\nUm but then we'll have services for after the babies born two\nSets of follow up support so she's\nThe dry and less formula close\nHousing stuff all that so yeah all that and so she might end up back with us at that point\nAnd what the timeline like let's say\nA girl text you tomorrow morning not am\nWhat's the timeline is fear and then how long do you typically stay with a client well\nWe can try to get women in the same day if it's a crisis pregnancy that's certainly our goal um and then for ... about a week out\nAnd not bad no not at all and um [noise] so and how long should stay with us that it is very firm woman to a woman because what happens is she's very concerned about telling family what well her parents say but after that\nShe gets passed that parents tend to rally they they they they she doesn't need our services as much anymore and she'll drift away but others stay in touch over the years and\nUh I've got to be very rewarding and some of my babies have babies wow yeah\nWell you've been out of the while the violent [laughter] [noise]\nYeah it's always astounded be where you hear the story the news at least once a month you know that some young woman\nComes home says mom dad I'm pregnant and she gets kicked out of house\nI've never understood that but it happens right\nIt's very infrequent because um you know parents love their kids they they they're not as fragile as the kids think they are parents have dealt with crisis in the past and you know they are going to deal with this crisis since well\nWhat about boyfriends and husbands badgering women into abortion you encounter that all\nWe do sometimes and um we you know we wanted them to come into the office with the patient so that we can talk to them together or separately and um you know it's amazing that\nMen often really don't understand the issues as well and so once they really understand what a portion is they're offended they\nThey say oh you know they would really do that I don't know if you had a chance to the ... movie\nI can talk about that in the in the kicker so yeah\nNot a fragile as the kids think they are parents have dealt with crisis in the past and you know they are going to deal with this crisis is well\nWhat about boyfriends and husbands badgering women into abortion you encounter that all we\nDo sometimes and um we you know we wanted them to come into the office which the patients so that we can talk to them together or separately and um yeah it's amazing that\nMen often really don't understand the issues as well and so once they really understand what a portion is they're offended they\nThey say oh you know they would really do that I don't know if you've had a chance to the ... movie\nI can talk about that in the in the kicker so yeah and uh but that\nThing is really eye opening\nPeople need to yeah they just don't understand but once they kind of start looking at it and then you know of course they want to think to themselves and they'll say laugh\nYeah so I mean you but you hear every day of the things going on and you wonder in your mind's eye you know is it\nIt seems unbelievable in every respect to the word that\nAnybody would want to do that but then at the same time we hear numbers of like\nYou know two thousand and three thousand times a day anywhere in the country babies are dying yeah\nSo what I'm hearing you say and what I read and what the CDC reports with the Guggenheim or Institute seemed to be\nLike we're not hearing to say we don't have our finger on the same outer post because well here's what I'm saying you guys are doing such great work you're not in countering that same\nDarkness since it's early\nBut there are losses rice I mean you\nAnd that's now but it seems by our conversation at least that victories far outweigh\nThe losses yeah especially with the ultrasound machine when a woman sees her baby she's here's the heartbeat you know it it it changes the issue the problems from let me get rid of it to how can I deal with it\nOkay and that makes sense and because\nObviously you guys have been out since a while and there's\nTo at least hope there's an alliance here in the valley of people that work together right\nYeah we have meeting some of every few months of the pregnancy centers\nThat's great writer because that's how it should work right 'cause not everybody can do everything\nYes yeah and ... different pregnancy centers can take on different um can change\nTheir services they offer like H women in Tempe that's over ... down there to them for that are very conveniently located the ASU campus that's true yeah and where they are on the GYN care\n[noise] All right well it's a forty three minutes after the hour if you'd just tuned in its Bruce Nixon show live the life of coffee studios here in the street and done that\nI'm Bruce addict and we're in Studio ... Riley the director of life choices women's clinics\nThere are two brick and mortar locations if you or anyone you love or no needs or to speak to them it's easy to get a hold and we'll get to the information here in a minute a but it's crisis pregnancy\nOr STD screening\nOBGYNs services if they're needed counseling talked about counseling\nWe yes that is a part of everything we offer you know Catholic healthcare used to I just read an article um subtitled 'em wet from nuns and habits to men in suits [laughter] and I'm so they've gotten from offering holistic care that cared about the person's body\n[noise] All right well it's a forty three minutes after the hour if you just tuned in its Bruce Nixon show live the life of coffee studios here in the street and done that\nI'm Bruce ... and we're in the studio with Sheila Riley the director of life choices women's clinics\nThere are two brick and mortar location if you or anyone you love or no needs a to speak to them it's easy to get a hold and we'll get to the information here in a minute a but it's crisis pregnancy\nOr STD screening\nOBGYNs services if they're needed counseling\nTalked about counseling we yes that is a part of everything we offer you know Catholic healthcare is to just read an article um subtitled um went from nuns and habits to men in suits [laughter] and I'm so they've gotten from offering holistic care that cared about the person's\nBody that also their emotions and their spirit right and now it's more about the money in the bottom line so we're really stepping packing offering a more holistic health care where we are dealing with both the body the emotions and the spirit so we'll talk to them about\nUm you know their face and we'll talk to them about\nThen coming ocean carry water is these days right talking about their faith not here this is right they friendly [laughter] right I mean you could argue that all the time people\nSee the crucifix on the wall here in the in the coffee shop and\nOther symbols around the shop and I've gotten some glances people walked out but the people I've you know\nIt used to be very common for people say God Bless you or something another environment but it seems somewhat hospital in the culture at large but you guys tread into the water oh of\nCourse you have because they're making the decision to their lives and certainly their faith is going to guide them in these big decisions of life\nAnd I I this is just a question that it's the proper due I had I mean do you find that most\nPeople you encountered have some faith that waste absolutely and that's a positive sign mhm that's a that's a hope in its own regard right that you're encountering young people or whatever age they might be and there's still a face out there because if you listen to the news it seems like this is no longer a Christian nation right\nThat you can get that impression is my point you\nCan get that impression I think what's happening for many of my clients that I not certainly not all that for many the safe is um\nBut you know what I mean it's a interwoven into that\nPerfect little vocabulary words All right we have ah about ten minutes and I want to get back to the mobile clinic\nAnd we haven't talked about this just yet but one of the things that I Know you\nDo I've seen you there many times not as many times as you've seen me not there if that makes sense\nYou guys are there almost every Sunday at the Planned Parenthood around fifty ninth avenue in New Jersey right\nUm yeah we have a revolving schedule okay so it's not every Sunday um than we've had some some ... a mechanical issues of recent ah keeping that grounded but um we did go to that abortion clinic it is one of the places where\nUm women going in can see that bus and they can you hear the federal counselor just offering them alternative um free pregnancy tests the Alps town now wait and um it's beautiful but we've seen many baby saves\nYou a big flower on the side and pretty colors them is very inviting it was my point yes I I think so a stark alternative to what\nNot as many times have you seen me not there if that makes sense you guys are there almost every Sunday at the Planned Parenthood around fifty ninth avenue and Eugene right\nUm yeah we have a revolving scheduled okay so it's not every Sunday um than we've had some some a mechanical issues of recent uh keeping at grounded but um we do go to that abortion clinic and it's one of the places where\nUm women going in can see that bus and they can you hear the federal counselor just offering them alternative um free pregnancy tests the Alps town now wait and um it's beautiful but the the mini baby saved\nSkeptics that our on the side and pretty colors them is very inviting it was my point yes I I think so a stark alternative to what's awaiting them and that cold stucco building yeah\nWe had a client who um said that yes you heard the word help and she said I was I didn't have any of that and I wanted that and that's why she came to our clinic\nYeah it's like you guys provide hoping hopeless world and love and such hateful times it's kind of like the little thing you know it's important because I I Am guessing here but are over my experience in the last Thirty years\nTalking to hundreds maybe a thousand different women who've been through similar experiences\nThey've all said essentially what you've just said that there's\nThat seems to be compounded\nAnd the enemy the great enemy old horn had really does a great job of\nTrying to convict people and make them feel guilty and maybe a sense of shame and wrongdoing or you know or even\nA sense of average in greed when it comes to having multiple children that can't possibly be done there's never enough resource as right and that's the sense of hopelessness that only\nFaith and the people are willing to do the work on the ground like yourself and others can overcome because there's not going to magically appear\nWhich is why you're doing the work right why we do the work [laughter]\nAll right so the mobile clinics out there\nAnd I hope you guys will tune in next Tuesday nine o'clock to the Bruce Nixon show and I think I'm about out of time but in the meantime I Want to say goodnight and God Bless and pray for America boy did we needed at all for now\n\nNine o'clock to the Bruce Nixon show and I

had worked in the media\nSo there there's a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that the government of Saudi Arabia was involved I I kind of think of is from what we know so far Lars this kind of a a mafia war\nBecause on the one hand you had the\nSaudi Government a predominantly now guided by the crown prince Mohammed bin ... and the U.S a man who is\nClearly a consolidating power and trying to take his country and about different ways or a in a new direction yeah and on the other hand you had a guy who was very\nClosely associated with and seems to have worked for the former head of Saudi intelligence turkey all ... all\nOf a man with the Muslim Brotherhood background or who had worked in the media relations a space for a turkey ... and the intelligence services of a Saudi Arabia under the previous government\nOr the one that uh that is how modern that his father of essentially replaced and what we know about that\nLars as having a densely uh this Muslim brother or to mark ... was a working it\nAppears with ... all against\nHis own government and so it wasn't just that he was saying nasty things about it and that can\nBe a capital offense by the way out there is law and here's insulting the keepers of the holy places uh the the family of Saudi Arabia royal family but he was also threatening it seems uh the the uh the government of a now predominantly\nMB ass as they call it so it it was a it was a\nParent Lee whether it was designed to such or whether it just went bad wait until now at the moment but I think it was kind of like a you know one ... or ... took out the other hand I've ended up in a ruthless Sasha\nMy because Frank I think the American people and I I think you know there's been a night or being sold a bill of goods are being told while this innocent journalist who's just writing things that are critical of the government which journalist in this country do all the time whether it's\nObama or Trump they they write critical things about the government I said critical things about the government but this guy was a player in the Muslim Brotherhood he was a friend\nOf Osama bin Laden and you said that he shared that organizations goal of trying to supplant the current government which is you say the current government of Saudi Arabia is trying to take that country in a western direction and uh and and this guy was trying to stop that so\nYou know wild that while that may not justify his murder um I I could certainly see that the American public's being told was just a journalist who was murdered and that's wrong they're not being told he was a political player who may have been trying to\nIs it fair to say overthrow the current Saudi Government and take it back and Islam is direction\n[noise] well it certainly reason to believe that that's the aspirations of the Muslim Brotherhood you know they they didn't to\nOverthrow the government of a President Mubarak in Egypt Today they were able to achieve that through a democratic process but they certainly were I'm taking Egypt in ... premises direction now the government of Saudi Arabia Sharif premises too but it's\nIt's a it's a\nGroup under the Brotherhood that would be very hostile\nTo us as was the Morsi regime\nIn a post Mubarak Egypt and I think\nWhat the president the government is is trying to wrestle with his first of all we don't know as much as we'd like then second of all we don't want to bring\nAs long as direction [noise] well it certainly reason to believe that that's the aspirations of the Muslim Brotherhood you know they they didn't to\nOverthrow the government of a President Mubarak in Egypt they they were able to achieve that through a democratic process but they certainly were I'm taking Egypt in ... premises direction now the government of Saudi Arabia ... premises too but it's\nIt's a it's a\nGroup under the Brotherhood that would be very hostile\nTo us as was the Morsi regime in a post Mubarak Egypt and I think what the president the government is is trying to wrestle with is first of all we don't know as much as we'd like then second of all we don't want to\nBring or otherwise contribute to the removal of the relatively friendly not altogether but relatively French government to undermine that solve odd was one that would be dead set\nAgainst us and our vital interests in a strategic place like Saudi Arabia the Iranians would like that other enemies of this country would applaud but I think that's not in our interest in the president's walking a fine line I think\nYeah and it's a tough one let's talk about something else the statutory commission to assess the threat\nTo the United states from electromagnetic pulse big name we've talked about EMP before on this program\nIt could come from an an attack from any number of sources that could come from a natural solar flare but it would literally knock out some or all of every single computer chip in America which runs everything refrigeration water power sewer\nYou know the the whole thing and in many many people would die if that happened in even a an area of this country the Congress has finally hearing some specific things that can be done to safeguard against this threat\nWell they've been hearing it for years a large the first of these commissions are reported in two thousand four and a has done so several times since I'm a whole bunch of reports were finished about a year ago or they haven't seen\nThe public light some of them are classified but some of them were supposed to be unclassified and the government is sort of been sitting on them meanwhile the commission that was extraordinarily informed knowledgeable talented and uh I think authoritative\nOn these matters has been replaced\nBy a politically appointed one that I fear is going to be none of those things and so we may not actually get the kind of\nA clarity about the danger that we're facing a let alone the tide of corrective action that's needed um\nAt least in this uh this new commission that's coming on stream a presumably shortly is a is involved and and this is heartbreaking because I think the president wants to do something about this I Believe John Bolton has bass or a national security advisor is very ... committed to trying to\nFix this there's an executive order that sort of a kicking around inside the the executive branch at the moment to protect our grid it's absolutely vital when you say a lot of\nThe cars might die by some estimates according to the previous commission it might be Ninety percent of us yeah\nEven hit the ... yeah I mean if we had kind of attacks and you know North Korea that maybe a smaller a threat at this point but if anybody a terrorist group in the west coast with an MP and knocked out all water all power all sewer all all all supply all ability to move goods around or\nAnything like that we could we could end up with a lot of communication that all of that even if the rest of the country we're capable of throwing in to help we see how even small disasters or will will test\nA national security adviser is very committed to trying to shake sisters and executive order that sort of a kicking around and so the the executive branch at the moment to protect our grid it's absolutely vital when you say a lot of\n'cause like die by some estimates according to the previous commission it might be Ninety percent of us yeah\nEven if he had all kinds of stuff yeah I mean if we had a kind of attacks and you know North Korea that maybe a smaller a threat at this point but if anybody a terrorist group in the west coast within the MPs knocked out all water all power all sewer all all all supply all ability to move goods around or\nAnything like that we could we could end up with a lot of communication that all of that even if the rest of the country we're capable of throwing in to help we see how even small disasters\nOr will will tax the ability of the country to to deal with it you know a hurricane that he gets a relatively small area and it still takes a tremendous amount of resources to make that happen so\nBy the way your data is everywhere data breaches

tell you of all the Web sites that I see\nAnd I do a lot of research and I I Try not to confine myself to just a narrow range yours is perhaps the most optimistic but not optimistic you know based on just who Pollyanna look at the world but optimism based on real numbers\nAnd I'm I I follow your Twitter feed and I think it's absolutely amazing what you've been able to do so\nGive my audience a

recorded history there are no international conflict by which I mean conflict between two southern nations so\nThat there are a lot of ways in which I'm In which the world is getting better unfortunately\nOr the media but also the human brain and we can talk about the structure of the human brain late to\nA focus is on the negative rather than the positive and so he set of long term trends people are looking at um you know individual instances of where a something bad happens and they assume that that somehow the representatives of the trends ...\nMurray on I I have to plead guilty that I've worked in the news business for a long time and I I hated it but people would say why is that you always tell bad news and I said well\nUh we have I happen to live in a city with a few hundred thousand homes and I said we always do the story about the one home that caught fire last night instead of the two hundred and Ninety nine thousand homes\nThat didn't catch fire and that can lead you to a little bit of a pessimistic attitude but I'll tell you the number that impressed me the most because we realize that well money isn't everything the ability to be out of the extreme poverty which has been you know it's been the norm as you say for an awful lot of the world for a long time\nBut you took numbers in the world bank and pointed out the people who live in extreme poverty in Nineteen Ninety that was thirty six percent of the world more than a third of the world\nLived in extreme poverty and lived on less than two dollars US dollars per day and that's adjusted for local prices that number between Nineteen Ninety and today twenty five years dropped from a third of the world\nTo about one tenth of the world now we'd like to get it to zero zero but you said even though world population increase by two billion people the number of those who were extremely\nPoor you know this is just scratching the living out of the dirt was was reduced by one point two

education certainly so at least\nSeven or eight years a primary education is completely stand it and uh one of the reasons for why that happened last technological progress you said you liked acknowledged progress than I Do like doing little bark and one of the greatest inventions was closed the tractor\nA and a a mechanization of agriculture because for the first time in history I'm\nA farm owners didn't have to rely on that children are in order to the farm work um but we were able to keep the children at work while uh the the the head of the family or the farmer\nAbsolutely yeah um it's crazy I mean just in the lab and Thirteen Years from twenty twelve to twenty twenty five they won the average fuel of cars that are sold to go from twenty nine miles per gallon two fifty five as you said it's an almost of doubling and all the years we've had automobiles um\nAnd twelve Thirteen Years we're supposed to practically doubled fuel efficiency and what that does is as you said earlier they have to a vastly increased costs in order to implement technology things like hybrid vehicles which are vastly more expensive than traditional vehicles or they have to wait\nWait and they're doing both and the problem is is that um there's very little benefit for this this at thousands of dollars up to six thousand seven thousand dollars per price of an average vehicle by most estimates and the this is right now because there's not an energy shortage a gas can be a little bit\nLower right now that'd be nice but it's not because it's because the demand not because of supply the oil of\nA crisis of the seventies is over America's an energy giant now we have more reserves than ever so the rationales entirely gone the only rationale is to fulfill pretty much of a green

entirely gone the only rationale is to fulfill pretty much of a green agenda of leftist politicians have bureaucrats\nAnd pushing people out of cars so Gerard ... is this going to happen could we see the Trump Administration say let's freeze the standards now\nWhen if you frozen standards wouldn't affect me if prices stopped going up on cars more people will buy newer cars more fuel efficient cars already because we know that a ten year old car is not going to get as good gas mileage as the one that's brand spanking new or you're too old\nIf we could stop that and just say let's just freeze the standards or has come as close to a freezes possible on all the new standards were pushing\nThe car companies to get there if we could reduce the cost of to the American family\nUh buying an automobile more of them would buy brand new ones that means more people would have new work cars a year or two or three or\nFive years old and we could reduce that Thirteen your average age back to something lower than that we'd get cleaner air we get more fuel efficiency and we wouldn't have to battered the consumer with these gigantic price increases\nAbsolutely not just the consumer but our auto makers their competitiveness our jobs are you know um our economy it hits it hits all the way down and the ridiculous ideas that as you said earlier because you've got to\nGet that average you're going to sell cars the smaller cars which are not as profitable but you want a skill away from the\nUh cars that are the bigger cars that are more comfortable and have more features that people want they'll actually increase the price of those to push people into our cars so it really skews the market at Scripps profitability or it\nYou know screws up all of the various ways that the economy should be running with consumer choice and the auto makers making vehicles that people actually want to drive\nAnd we're living in a gray days right now or technology is doing amazing things with a you know crash warnings and laying changing and break assessed and ... and all that good stuff that's making cars safer but with these crazy CAFE standards they're going to keep people out of these cars and they're going to hold onto their car much longer um\nWhich is not only less fuel efficient but it's also less safe\nWell and it and that's a big difference because they say when you get to smaller cars for every hundred pounds you trim off the car you say well that's more efficient they say it's also five percent more likely to kill you in a crash\nAnd and frankly I Know that they knew

made a similar threat back in April with the last caravan\nPresident Trump last time when a couple of thousand of them came up he threatened to withdraw aid from Honduras or that never happened and

asylum\nRight yeah the idea is they're fleeing for something like violent yes if the violence in Honduras when they reach Guatemala they've already found asylum thank you right\nThat's really what they're looking for is not asylum they're looking for a to come to a place where there's more of fluids nothing wrong with that I don't blame them but that's what they're looking to do\nAnd don't buy the rag Greg Greg I'll give you can point but just to back up your first point Guatemala again has said they will not provide asylum to these people\nRight out of the matter is you know if\nIt if there were another wealthy country between us and you have you with care man they went out there exactly right\nYeah they're just coming here because we're a wealthy country it's not because they

in two thousand and twelve\nAnd then really two thousand and fourteen as well\nRepublicans were the ones talking about health care\nAnd Democrats\nDidn't want to mention that because of Obamacare was

[laughter] anyway so good morning Brennan on what shall we talk about this morning\nWell I Love the fact that uh you start off the morning by telling people that even though it's got and it's not quite as warm as it typically is people ought to be drinking water was in a regular basis and you know even you know obviously liver medic is a totally focused on reducing the toxins in the body and sort of repairing the digestive tract and that's kind of our focus\nA sort of monitoring and managing the amount of glucose and insulin in the blood and when it gets a you know when the glucose gets to hire the infant a glucose gets to lower incident gets too hot it's the one breaking down into when it's all the major store of like it just so\nIf the liver isn't properly working because we have a concentration of fat cells that are interrupting it's um proper management\nThen you're going to get a type two diabetic a type of influence and maybe you don't have full blown type two diabetes maybe your pre diabetic not maybe you're not even there they beat us have high fasting blood sugar but that is the stats and it's going to continue that trend if you don't reverse it so that's\nThat's the major ones as far as I'm fatty liver is concern of course you can go to the doctor and you can ask for liver ends on test and if it's high that's a clear indication where if you have um an ultrasound\nOr and you know you find something in there then you're you're kind of really progressed on that spectrum because typically\nIt's not going to catch a fatty liver until you're close to twenty percent concentration of fat cells within the liver which means you really well\nAh down that road to to um you know liberal on health or they want to back off that uh as quick as possible you definitely want to encourage people to be taking a product like about it but when it comes to leaky got\nThis is where things become a little bit more\nThe staff and it's going to continue that trend if you don't reverse it so that's\nThat's the major ones as far as I'm fatty liver is going to sort of course you can go to the doctor and you can ask for liver ends on test and if it's high that's a clear indication where if you have um an ultrasound\nOr and you know you find something in there then you're you're kind of really progressed down on that spectrum because typically\nIt's not going to catch a fatty liver until you're close to twenty percent concentration of fat cells within the liver which means you really well\nAh down that road to to um you know liberal on health I didn't want to back off that uh as quick as possible you definitely want to encourage people to be taking your product like a padded back when it comes to leak you got\nThis is where things become a little bit more difficult to identify so sometimes people say well you know there is a bunch of foods that I used to eat when I was younger but now that I'm older I have some problems digesting them so I kind of avoid them that's an indication\nUm there's people who have a ... a gas confrontation diarrhea that kind of stuff that's certainly an indication\nUh any pain obviously that's that's an easy one but essentially discomfort and sometimes we have folks not sometimes we do a lot of folks unfortunately that are in this category where they go to their doctor\nMhm and they'll tell them that they are suffering from depression that they have massive food sensitivities that it is they smell something like let's say a a woman were to enter an elevator and they got that same elevator and they are where we are a lot of perfume that's very effective if a man's got into an elevator he was wearing a lot of\nColumbus works both ways uh you know\nThey are very sensitive to that and they ended up having some sort of reaction to it those indications why is that because the leaky got eighty percent of your immune system's located down there\nSo if it gets triggered it doesn't just get triggered in your digestive tract gets triggered throughout your whole body it's not a local thing go whenever you come in contact and this is a also applies to personal healthcare product anything that you breathe than\nI that goes into your lungs your whole new system gets triggered so if you aren't sensitized to all these things you really need to focus on digestive health are and that sort of that sort of the key and I and I think a lot of folks when they think of digestive health and rightly so they think\nProbiotics gotta get my hands on good pro buyout which\nWe are a a big proponent of we don't we don't make any of them we\nFeel that there are lots of companies out there that to a wonderful job this we're not interested and I'm trying to compete in space with more interested in making products that\nUh aren't currently made and provide 'em a sort of a seal up a hole in the market so it would be one of the issues that we see with ... says they don't like to stick\nTo a wall that a either doesn't exist or is constant a battle zone so when you start taking a product like we could get repair that has things like\nAh immune suppressed there's\nA things to seal up uh opening like a think an MSN other ingredients in there\nAre and also help to promote your cultural secretion and other things to help line the digestive tracts the body can repair itself\nNow you're open to go out and get a nice ... and sort of re inoculate your digestive system so those things like candy to parasites can't a sort of a you know jump back into the apartment buildings and so it you know\n... says they don't like to stick to a wall that a is it doesn't exist or is constant a battle zone so when you start taking a product likely could go repair that has things like ah immune suppressed there's\nA things to seal up uh opening like a think an MSN and other ingredients in there\nAre and also help to promote your cultural secretion and other things to help line the digestive tracts the body can repair itself\nNow you're open to go out and get a nice ... and sort of re inoculate your digestive system so those things like candy to parasites can't\nA sort of a you know jump back into the apartment buildings and so you know to try and destroyed that got line it yet but you have to get it to the point where at least ... apartment buildings are now that you don't have broken windows and broken doors on it that's the way it sort of look at things\nLike an allergy [laughter] so ... what happens if we let it go I Know you've touched yeah so how is it that\nYeah I'm unfortunately if you go to conventional doctor and this is\nThey don't either approve of a natural approach or are they sort of whether to keep going and they said look you know you can go on a some additional antibiotics you can go on some uh we have some painkillers for you or if you have a liver issue will give you that form and this is one of the natural progression of saying\nThe pain killers will do additional damage that adjusted track I met foreman masks those things the antibiotics obviously there's just destroying your you know that the natural biome in there and people progressively have worse and worse liver problems\nThey have high cholesterol they have high blood pressure again because the body is trying to equilibrium itself and this is the way it does it\nIt can't properly monitored and regulate and manage a blood glucose so now you're a type two diabetic\nAh the cognitive declines increase because perhaps they'll put you on a stat and drug which reduces the fat in your body we all know that fat it be a major insulator for all their old growth so drove roast sort of a it's now at a standstill and any degradation that damage\nCannot be repaired so this is the reason why and I I Know that when I'm Talking or to the listeners out there they're saying oh my goodness you know I Know this\nI've seen this progression either with you know my grandparents for myself and my parents or whatever it is so this is what happens and we want to make sure that people have an out\nIt's not complicated this pathology is very easy to understand you can go deliver medical dot com and we have all of the articles written a ends going layman terms that people understand what the pathology here but the conventional docs they haven't caught up to this\nSo they'll put you on the pharmaceutical a track and it will be really difficult to get off and I know first hand because I was in the pharmaceutical industry\nAnd as soon as I figured out what was going on I laughed so don't hold it against me [laughter] I didn't know what I didn't know a but once I figured it out I laughed and he got into\nThe the natural alternative space so\nYou do need to address and I will say even for you know folks who may or may not feel a lot of The Simpsons or I Would say look\nProphylactic way um these toxins or in the environment they're in the foods\nYou eat organic wonderful you ever go out to eat at a restaurant you're getting it or if you have aluminum and your um deodorant if you have a fluoride in your toothpaste or you know I could go on and on anything that you put on your skin a Seventy five percent trans during all that stuff gets into your body\nReally difficult to get off and I know first hand because I was in the pharmaceutical industry and as soon as I figured out what was going on I laughed so\nDon't hold it against me [laughter] I didn't know what I didn't\nKnow a but once I figured it out I left and he got into the the natural alternative space so\nYou do need to address and I will say even for you know folks who may or may not feel a lot of the Simpson or I Would say look\nProphylactic way um these toxins or in the environment they're in the foods\nYou eat organic wonderful you ever go out to eat at a restaurant you're getting it\nOr if you have aluminum and your um deodorant if you have\nA fluoride in your toothpaste or you know I could go on and on anything that you put on your skin a Seventy five percent trans during all that stuff gets into your body and we do talk to five and I just told you about Ninety eight percent I Would just tell you but I'm going to Ninety eight percent of women\nWho um give birth when they do a test\nThey test uh one of the things that they they do try to identify as it was quite the same uh and they found that Ninety eight percent of women whether they eat right or not\nHave trace amounts of license plates in the body we know that that is a not a good thing for the fetus obviously because it does cross that a central a barrier show if\nIf women who are you know that they're pregnant on our eating healthy\nAfter ... life say in their system it's basically an everybody and they just said crisis they\nDisrupt the digestive tract and also inhibits she uh enzymes\nIn the liver to help us intoxicated so this is something that even if you're not suffering from all of these terrible thing um you need to take more or less ... a from a prophylactic standpoint and maintenance standpoint\nPrinted we're almost out at times can you wrap up any um points that you'd like to let listeners know in about one minute sure she works for sure\nSo uh I Would say most people a lot of focus on say justice health that would be the first place I Would start because that's the first domino or we can repair is one of the most successful products we have in our wind up uh in all of our products are made\nA ... or extremely clean we sell to of physicians and well educated health food stores like a healthy habit\nSo we are different from the rest of the industry the other thing that I Would say and this is more of a public service announcement is take a look at 'em you know go go to your bathroom take a look at all the products you have in there and make sure that they're clean\nYour deodorant your um your soaps your shampoos you were toothpaste and particularly in Arizona you have a high concentration of war naturally occurring makes sure utility has not dropping additional forward in your drinking water it's very dangerous it lowers IQ and it's highly toxic\nIn your drinking water it's very dangerous it lowers IQ and it's highly toxic right\nYes that side has died [laughter] sad stay right [laughter] yeah so\nUm so that's an end to else's serving I'm at the ... of a daily uh sauerkraut daily you know that's better than eating the whole bottle at one time\nYou know once once a week or once every two weeks and I have people call me and say oh my gosh I just ate the whole bottle what's\nGoing to [laughter] I feel really good and you're telling me that they're going to have a good trip to the bathroom\nNow tell us how how this sets it apart from just getting off the rack and the grocery store 'cause I Know it's a little bit different\nWell first and foremost we are local you know gay logo so um we're local and um [noise]\nA second all I I don't have any water to my ... I make the vegetables create their own brine and just so it's very nutrient jets are no um and there's you know um\nMany different recipes out there that support works for us and um I think part of that makes it more powerful also um we simulated ... salt putting minimum back into it I mean a lot of people say oh it's really salty and I use a little salt as possible um\nBut that's all it really helps um and also provide that extra layer of mineral a you know the works and for you um the more ... again and I'm the ingredients are intentional you met him really most importantly there is no vinegar in their ... and\nSo when you start getting into big and you have to mass produce and stuff then you've got to find ways to make it last longer and and so forth and um vinegar and pasteurized station or not bacteria as friends they kill the bacteria\n[noise] so how long does this process take for you well we're I think I'm so we process in a day will make 'em you know a couple of accidents than a day and let that ferment anywhere from four to eight eight week as\nWell as long as we can um which would start a new piece of equipment that really is designed to um make tower crawl to Cabot\nShredder we bought it I saw your video on it was really cute [laughter] excited about that\nPiece of equipment I still am um so I I've noticed that it's bringing out different colors and the vegetables mom because of this red on at the cut on it but um ah what were we talking about vinegar and ... and yeah\nYeah well how does the process the process of dying\nHow long supported six weeks and then we'd still hand pack everything ... or so\nBacteria as friends they kill the bacteria\n[noise] so how long does this process take for you\n[noise] well where I think I'm so we process in a day will make 'em you know a couple of access than a day and let that ferment anywhere from four to eight eight week as well as long as we can um which would start a new piece of equipment that really is designed to um make tower crawled you know it's a cabbage shredder\nWe bought it I saw your video on it was really cute [laughter] excited\nAbout that piece of equipment I still am um so I I've

talk a little bit before we get started okay\nWe we had a gift during the day after day rabbi bureau and\nHe was talking about I'm Jamal Chris choke eat this so called journalist from the Washington Post in the Washington Times uh yesterday and everyone in across the world is trying to make this guy is a sign and let me tell you something if you tell your boss\nIn today's morning monologue all talk a little bit we had a great gift yesterday\nClinton Kramer from a fund the wall\nAnd I'm the factor that we've had had some exciting news this week all week long the White House is listening to our show very honored to have there and I can't believe can you believe the fat little any good at something like that it's pretty incredible but I Want to talk a little bit before we get started okay\nWe ... we had a gift on yesterday rabbi bureau and he was talking about\nI'm Jamal could show game this so called journalists from the Washington Post and the Washington Times uh yesterday and everyone in across the world is trying to make this guy down in the same and let me tell you something if you tell your boss that you know better how to spend his money\nHow to run his company or her company and that you're not going to do what they want you to do but you're going to do what you want to do\nHow long do you think you're going to stay there you're going to get fired if you threaten the president of the United states you're going to get locked up for a long long time\nAnd if you joined a group of murderers like the Muslim Brotherhood and threaten your teen you're gonna get killed the\nFour zero for six six when you're on the\n\nShow broadcasting live from Las Vegas today the weather's beautiful out here so we're going to be speaking at an event at five o'clock\nAnd seven thirty this evening and then it I Believe at the ten o'clock hour or two we may have to do something different on the show tomorrow but let's see we'll see what happened\nSo we got did get confirmed that are burning the wall will be in Washington DC at the end of the month and they're just trying to get the date on it but they work and find that they are going to get a hundred thousand away\nTo a department of homeland security in what they did you know and I'm going to take them a real quick I finished the point because um you know the departments aren't\nUm they're not set up to ... the money now that Iran is they're they're set up to receive money but none of the other agencies are and that's pretty neat thing what they did\nGetting their water together where they can actually give the department of homeland security which is what they're doing with the crowd funding so they're partnering with and this is part of what President Trump was talking about\nWhen he said that there should be some kind of partnership between\nThe business\nThat are burning the wall will be in Washington DC at the end of the month and they're just trying to get the dates on it but they were confirmed that they are going to give that a hundred thousand away to a department of homeland security and what they did do you know and I'm going to say something oh real quick I finished the point\nBecause um you know the departments aren't um they're not set\nUp to receive money now the IRS is they're they're set up to receive money but none of the other agencies are and that's a pretty neat thing what they did get in their lawyers together where they can actually gift the department of homeland security which is what they're doing with the crowd funding so they're partnering with and this is part of what President Trump was talking about\nWhen he said that there should be some kind of partnership between\nThe\nBusiness world and the government for a lot of these projects especially rebuilding America and there's a lot of money out of here so why are we spending\nBillions hundreds\nOf billions of dollars every year in China to rebuild their country\nI mean the war's over a long time ago and those were the policies that we still go by today and I don't know why we're doing that but I think things are going to change your under President Trump we shouldn't be building\nSouth Korea we shouldn't be rebuilding the European countries anymore or\nMexico or Canada none of them we should be rebuilding the United states of America now President Trump said this morning that\nUh if these countries\nAre Latin American countries continue to send their people up here and let them come then they're going to cut off funding that includes Mexico of the money that we give them every year to help them out and I think that's fair why should we give them money to help them build their economies\nAnd let all the people come in that want to come\nFor economic asylum political asylum all that good stuff to the tune of about a hundred and thirty five billion dollars a year and that's not including what it cost us for\nPutting them away in jails when they goof up over here and act crazy and don't want to assimilate and become Americans anyway it's all craziness out there getting back to the walk of the White House story here so fund the wall\nAnd it's going to be there towards the end of this month they're going to get a hundred thousand dollars away we've been invited to be there will let you know the exact date\nOr if we're going to make that trip but hopefully we do need to be very exciting for the fly Mackey show to be able to do something like this we're very excited anyway that was ... I was asked them questions and I talked about it a little bit yesterday\nAbout um the kind of show we have um\nKnow how we get our stories how we report are stored who gives us a story and we as citizens report so I explained\nIn these fifty questions about the fly Mackey show being on eleven hundred camping acts with fifty thousand watts accent or having seven million people under armed Brelo being around for decades and decades so it's it's you know it's a great station to me on the great family here\nBut they were asking me questions trying to get very specific on exactly how we come up with our stories because we've broken and this is where they really wanted to find out how do we break here fly Mackey shows I Can't believe the fat little and then it gets to do this stuff and they still blows me away\nHow we've been able to break\nAbout um the kind of show we have um you\nKnow how we get our stories how we report are stored who gives us our stories and we have citizen to report so I explained\nIn these fifty questions about the fly Mackey show being on eleven hundred camping acts with fifty thousand ... having seven million people under our umbrella being around for decades and decades so it's it's you know it's a great station to be on the great family here\nBut they were asking me questions trying to get very specific on exactly how we come up with our stories because we've broken and this is where they really wanted to find out how do we break here fly Mackey shows I Can't believe the fat little and then it gets to do this stuff and they still blows\nMe away how we've been able to break five national news stories when you've got\nThousands and thousands of other broadcast out there and news agencies here in the United states not including the big boys and the big girls that didn't break those stories before we did in how we were able to do it so I explained to them and are broken down question by question or answer my answer of how we have citizen reporters\n... read these reporters that we have what they do is they go out and they look for the facts\nWe have liberal reporters we are conservative reporter and we have constitutional type ... when I say that this is a mindsets behind these people that are reporting for us they're not for or against anything they're not for president they're not against President Trump\nThey don't have that mentality even though I can say there's\nA couple of those stories that we broke came from a liberal friends are liberal with ... that were out there that just reported the facts\nSo as I put was given the facts I put them together and wrote\nThe story and then I gave it out and I told them by the way here's what the story's going to look like they approve the story 'cause they wrote it in a lot of these citizen reporters don't want to be recognized or given credit for the stories so we get here flying a climax dot com\nA flight TV accent or on your on the radio or I get to take credit for the stories even though I'm not the one doing the investigating research on okay so we're very proud and why broken down\nOr about um how we do these stories\nEtcetera so anyway we'll see what happens we're trying to get some Prescott dancers cause they asked us if we wanted press credentials for some of these\nEvents that President Trump does and would we be willing to travel I'm like\nYes [laughter] so we're waiting is pending will say we're going to get any kind of credentials but we're very excited about this because we're not in a um\nI guess we're not the typical news station etcetera etcetera etcetera but we do our best to reporting the news as we get it fit corn today let's do a little bit of news this morning so what was talking about the disruptive and this is what I'm going to talk a lot a little bit about\nThis evening and tomorrow of the block chain and why it is called disruptive what exactly is happening with the block chain where do they come from how long has it been around and what does it do for you well\nA lot of the the number one thing I guess you could say in simple language is it a verification platform to verify who you are what you have\nWhat kind of identification comes\nYes we are not the typical news station etcetera etcetera etcetera but we do about that reporting the news as we get it fit calling today let's do a little bit of news this morning so what was talking about the disruptive and this is what I'm going to talk a little bit about\nThe saving and tomorrow of the block chain and why it is called disruptive\nWhat exactly is happening with the block chain where do they come from how long has it been around and what does it do for you well\nA lot of the the number one thing I guess you could say in simple language is it the verification platform to verify who you are\nWhat you have\nWhat kind of identification comes with you and we're that identification comes from a can that be verified and\nSo then it gets verified through\nThe block chain where whoever you're trying to do business with them you're trying to do business with a gas station or the grocery store or any coffee place or some kind of\nClothing outlet or ants are paid here in Arizona for a P. S. or the banks\nIt's a verification system that cannot be duplicated when I say duplicate it I mean it cannot be changed it can be duplicated that's the whole point of it is to duplicate it it can't be changed so let's say in\nYour little area where you live in your ten block area or\nYour one mile area quarter mile area you could break it down any way you want\nThere's hundreds and hundreds of people the programmers they get on the block chain anybody can get on the block to and you have to get verified first but you get on the block chain and it's a race to see who can verify that information that you're trying to put out who you are\nThis is why it's disruptive why because it's going to knock merchant process and completely out of the ball game that is going to be a dead industry anyway let me get back to this real quick know get to who's going to get knocked out in the ballpark here\nAre in now will be able to play anymore at least a in a limited form anyway so\nOnce they verify who you are\nThat is a permanent record\n... nobody can get in got it got a couple of minutes we're going to go out for the second segment so they cannot get in and change that now\nYou've got hundreds and hundreds of people and thousands and this is going to create millions and millions of jobs merely that's why the disruptor a people who are willing to go on and verify for a little bit of crypto currency dust\nSo nobody's going to be able to get on and get rich during the transferred but what they can do learn a living\nAnd they don't care who you or what you're doing they just want a barrel by that the information that you're putting out that's trying to be received is true want this verified then it goes out to the no ... in the note says hey I did it\nAnd that means nobody else can touch it and then at that point the note puts it out to the world than a block has been verified and once that block has been verified the world knows\nNobody's going to be able to get on and get rich doing transferred but what they can do learn living\nAnd they don't care who you are what you're doing it I just want to ban by that the information that you're putting out that's trying to be where he said is true wanted verified then it goes out to the no ... in the note that hey I did it\nAnd that means nobody else can touch it and then at that point the note put it out to the world that a block has been verified and what that block has been verified the world knows\nI'll get to that and the second like what you don't have but what I'm Talking about here is listen eighty percent of all these wallets who have crypto currency and it was Pacific Lee bitcoin had never been touched after that initial purchase what does that mean that means there's an awful lot of folks out there like you\nWho\nBelieve that bitcoin is going to be the money in the future or at least gonna be a store house or a store value of the future like a bank\nOh thank you baby Jesus man [laughter] it's going to be like a bank that's the easiest way to put it\nOr like a very valuable home on the block everyone wants to limit but they have to live in the house because guess who got it you got it so it's become very valuable that's why at this stage right here you want to do your best to get position ... all one\nNow what's the significance of all of this what does this matter do well I'll tell you\nNot to the banking business is ever going to go out they're not stupid and they got smart they started putting their money into the online and wallets\nIs they're going to be Cassius cash going to go away no cash going to be around for a long time forever probably who knows but we're moving into the digital world and what does that mean for you well the Internet was never set up\nNever it was never set up to have a for\nAll the passwords that we have to him it was set up for one password you use set up a password year on after that it was never set up for all these applications and all these sites\nJust thinking of all your passwords and all your sites all the hacking goes on because it's so simple to hack these little computers now earlier I was talking about\nThe security of the block chain and why it's so important let's get to that\nBecause you have\nThousands hundreds of thousands and millions of people that are getting on the block chain to help make these transactions okay that's number one so it\nWas\nA transaction\nOr some information is verified it goes out to us\nNever it was never set up to have a\nFor all the passwords that we have to him it was set up for one password you use set up a password year on after that it was never set up for all these applications and all these sites just thinking of all your passwords and all your side all the hacking goes on because it's so simple to hack\nThese little computers now earlier I was talking about the security of the block chain and why it's so important let's get to that because you have\nThousands hundreds of thousands and millions of people that are getting on the block chain to help make these transactions okay that's number one so it\nWas a transaction or some information is verified it goes out to all the nose in all the computers get it then I'll get it what does that mean what that means that you would have to go in and hack\nFifty one percent of those thousands hundreds of thousands and millions of computers\nEach and every one of them all with different addresses different connections et cetera et cetera et cetera this way past the pay grade of today's conversation today show to get into all this\nBut what I'm trying to tell you is the security of the block chain in bitcoin specifically is going to change\nThe way that we are trained Zach verify who we are credit oh boy that's a big one we're going to get to that in the second second what you have\nAnd are making transactions\nWhere nobody's going to be able to get in and hack that permanent ledger\nI'm telling you what if you get yourself position [laughter] it's gonna be awesome what's gonna happen to places like Google what's gonna happen to play\nTo companies like Facebook and Twitter well there'll be a there'll be companies in the past don't things are going to be around forever\nWhy do you think Google is making a play for China because they know their days are ended they're coming to an end it was going to be a disruption because why those companies on the block pain now already there called de centralized companies were the people are in control\nNot a CEO not a corporate office not a political view\nIs based on fact and information there's other sites coming up white tea and see it\nJust the way the day is coming Google will be a name of the past Sunday at least here in the United states they're already making deals with China\nAnd it's crazy you out and do your research on that Facebook Twitter where they censor what you say it's the craziest thing in the world and get censored anyway we're going to talk about some stories coming up\nFake watching God they continue to make it no how about like what you have so you get dressed you look good you put on some nice 'cause you get in a house that you can't afford a car you can't afford the model all kinds of money on credit you look good not I'm not putting anybody down I'm just saying this is what our credit\nAnd the fake ... behind that does to us\nIt creates more credit but it gives no substance behind your wealth the block change going to say people are going to be able to go on businesses and go hey\nThere's average Joe and there's average Jane we know they make this much we know they live there we know they pay their bills we know they're buying this cat at this gas station and this grocery store at this coffee shop and this clothing store\nAnyway we're going to talk about stories coming up\nBy what you got they continue to make it now how about like what you have to get grant you look good you put on tonight you get in a house they can't afford a car you can't afford you bought all kinds of money on credit you look good not I'm not putting anybody down and just saying this is what our credit\nAnd the fake net behind that does to us\nIt creates more credit but it gives no substance behind your well the block change going to say people are going to be able to go on businesses and go hey\nTheir average Joe and their average Jane we know they make that much we know they lived there we know they pay their bill we know they're buying this gas at this gas station and

I remember it was an August and I'm thinking\nAbout what's happening in Washington or Phoenix or wherever it may be instead of focusing on living our lives and taking care of the people the institutions that are important to us\nI think that a lot of it just becomes somewhat wasted energy and one of the reasons I think the understanding how the financial world works is it gives you the ability to build an income to build wealth for yourself or your family your church synagogue jump or whatever it may be\nBut you can do that without having to get caught up in all of the the viciousness\nThat has become the system but I Do want to talk a little bit of politics today simply because it it how it's going to I think potentially affect the market and could potentially affect the market in a very great way I'm going to take a step back\nTo ... I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on talking about how people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was there were only two groups\nAnd and this was before ... and by the way 'cause I remember that part of it or whatever that you know a few months before that so they rate\nWhat they're only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy seven percent\nAnd the other was cops at about fifty two percent and one of the points I made was and again this was pretty Ferguson is you know there was a lot of pressure already be put on kind of people's views of cops and that may not be holding given that it was only fifty two percent back then and that would have very important implications\nI Want the country to work okay but I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if they're right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives are going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just because I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash and the idea this classes and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is before the market goes down you gotta know what you're going to do when\nThe country to work okay but I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people are predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as

conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash and the idea that this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is\nBefore the market goes down you got to know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money in the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble\nThey put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong and again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turned down a can turn down very quickly\nIf you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of games think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay\nIf you want Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down then you can on the move up so again in classroom and talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked winter like four okay you know you have your ... in your are your uh see the eyes and ears on hold for thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got they won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kinda figured out that once you're about eight days out your four cats is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be\nYou're only looking at averages ... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecasters really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter] and that's a lot of this is that people used something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market is supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make this a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing as opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do\nSo again

will be cool okay\nWhy tourists to this market but let's talk about some science for that may be nearing atop\nFirst thing was drawing the wall Street Journal today that of the companies that are going public this year eighty three percent of them are losing money now that is the highest in recorded history\nAnytime they've tracked that this is the biggest number of it's ever been is now a clipped what was happening in the year two thousand or eighty one percent of the companies were not profitable when companies are going public and then the stocks are going up which many of these stocks are where there are these ridiculous evaluation\nThere were known as unicorn stock these companies that have no profits that are worth a billion dollars or more\nThat is a sign of a bubble and that is a sign that we are closer to the end than we are to the beginning of this Ron\nThere's another story I just read that Charles Schwab investors which a classic retail traders are now sitting on less cash than they've been at any time in history so they are becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market\nCourt in history anytime they've tracked this this is the biggest number of it's ever been is now a clipped what was happening in the year two thousand or eighty one percent of the companies were not profitable\nWhen companies are going public and then the stocks are going up which many of these stocks are where there are these ridiculous evaluation\nThere were known as unicorn stock these companies that have no profits that are

Schwab investors which a classic retail traders are now sitting on less cash than they've been at any time in history so they're becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market is supply and demand if you've taken away the demand\nAnd there isn't more money on the sidelines to kind of come in and then what is going to take the market up to the next level\nNow what's been taking it up is companies buying back their own stock and companies are buying back a record amount of stock this year they never bought so much and that constrains supply and that could drive this market higher again\nThis is a I don't want to be giving you some big doom and gloom in this market can keep going higher than the repatriation of all that money coming back from overseas\nIs a huge part of what's driving this market higher now it's a one time deal but some of the people aren't spending the money this year that could spend it next year so maybe you got a little bit left in the tank next year but at some point it has to come down and again we need to be prepared for that before it happened\nWe got to have the fundamental skills to be able to benefit when this happens\nBecause you can actually make more money faster on the downside than the upside but at a minimum we've got to know how to protect what we've got\nSo again the Klan someone to be teaching on before the crash what do you do and also what we're going to cover is what does he keeps going up what should we be doing there's always a way to make money in this market

very long way and in fact why you may see a top in this market pretty soon\nYou know early this year I said I thought you'd see the top this year and we don't we haven't really gone much above where we were in January kind of gone back and forth around there\nYou know I said we could have one more run this year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year but what's going to keep taking this market higher and in the last segment I told you a little bit about what I see an evidence of the top and the market\nOne is the fact that more companies are going public selling shares\nBrought you buy online training academy Phoenix deliberating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education All right this week we've been talking about the ... kind of the state of the market and why I think we're closer to the top than the bottom at this point by a very long way\nAnd in fact why you may see a top in this market pretty

could have one more run this year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year but what's going to keep taking this market higher and in the last segment I told you a little bit about what I see an evidence of the top and the market\nOne is the fact that more companies are going public selling shares initial\nPublic offering demand pop cattle more companies that have no profits\nThan ever in history so Wall Street journal today to the eighty three percent of the company's going public right now have an earnings have gone public the last twelve months no earnings in two thousand the height of the dot com it was eighty one percent so that again is kind of big bubbly sign\nNext big bubbly sign that the fact that you go to a place like Charles Schwab where it's retail traders not professionals okay they have their customers have less cash sitting on the sidelines than they've had an ad I think at any time in history if I remember correct\nBut they don't have a lot of extra money now you combine that with something else we've talked about before on the show which is what's called margin debt\nRight now in this country people are barred about six hundred and sixty billion dollars to buy stocks that's about three and a quarter percent of gross domestic product the entire US Economy\nSo what's happening is people are taking the money they have been buying stocks because most people are massively behind the eight ball you know and soft and the other day\nThat if you look at people even in their sixties\nThe average person had something like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and assets okay hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars is going to get you anywhere with all due respect in retirement\nTo really get to where most people need to be you're talking millions which means most people aren't going to get where they need to be you can still do better but you know most people are going to be in the hole on that a hundred and Seventy five it's not close\nBut what's amazing about it it's almost all equity in houses now part of a drive in the equity in houses is\n... ... real estate the mortgage rates are so low but they're going up and here's kind of again of big key in the\nTop when you have this much margin debt what happens is is that as people borrow more and more money to buy stocks so like when you buy stock you don't have to put up all the money just put up half of it\nOr you borrowed the rest of it well as their stocks go up in value you get more borrowing capacity so you don't actually have to solve the stocks so all this money gets created and that creates demand\nOpioid addiction shattered too many lives and broken the hearts of too many family it's time for toughness and resolve\nIn

debate between Robert or work and Ted Cruz stay with us [noise]\n\n\n\nSo according to the world Economic Forum study of global rankings the United states the leads for the first time since the two thousand in a financial crisis under the new framework for competitiveness released Tuesday us achieve the closest to competitiveness frontier or ideal state with a score of eighty five point six Singapore had eighty three\nGermany had eighty to Switzerland headed to Japan had eighty two and they're talking about really economic freedom as well and they the tools map competitiveness through a bunch of indicators\nThey look at infrastructure they look at institutions the adoption of information communications technology macroeconomic stability health skills product labor\nOr product market labor market financial system market size business uh uh innovation et cetera et cetera et cetera\nAll good things right\nIt's where the most competitive economy for the first time in a decade that's what this means\nIt is the now the most competitive country in the world number one\nAt the ... the world Economic Forum\nDid add a little ...\nThey said well we could still do better on social issues and you can Kiss My edible snakes because I think everything's just just the way it is people are free to do what they want\nAnd if you don't like it mind your own business\nI just don't understand why freedom and so hard to get for people\nLike the government does not have to socially beyond your loves when you don't have to do people don't understand\nFreedom of people I think there are people out there who are willing\nBeijing et cetera et cetera et cetera all good things right\nIt's where the most competitive economy for the first time in a decade that's what this means\nIt is the now the

because I think everything's just just the way it is people are free to do what they want\nAnd if you don't like it mind your own business\nI just don't understand why the freedom of so hard to get for people\nLike the government does not have to socially beyond your lives and you don't have to do people understand\nFreedom of people I think there are people out there who are willing first\nThey they don't understand freedom they think that freedom means that the government guaranteed your right to happiness not your pursuit of happiness government doesn't even guarantee that you can pursue something that you all you want to\nBut there's no guarantee that you're going to be happy\nIf you just have the freedom to pursue it\nPeople think freedom mean comfortable and this and they think freedom means everything is perfect and nothing's wrong in my life and I think that some some of these people I just don't think that they have an idea of what reality or freedom is\nYou do what you want to do someone else is going to do what they want to do\nDied the idea that a freedom that some of these individuals have is if someone else is doing something that I don't like the neck not freedom\nBecause they're not doing what I Want because they don't believe how I think they should believe because they don't talk how I Want them to talk they don't use the pronouns that I Want them to use they don't recognize the things that I recognize\nThat not freedom that that\nTyranny it's fascism\nAnd I just don't I really don't give a flying rats behind\nWith the world like an honest one linked about our social issues is good on two fronts this is good not only because as a competitor in the world the United states is number one number two for all those global if they want this global economy want to be this this ... this is the world Economic Forum why don't\nI just think that they really don't care who they are but they just they just measure the data that's out\nThere right there the only organization on that level but does it so my point is that you're going to be so nice I'm like screw them even if you're global if this was something good to look at so you really have to have Trump if you've been something negative about it as\nOh yeah I mean I don't I don't get why people would would do that but that's that's the thing that they say\nThey talked to are they warned about a ... a brewing\nTrade war between the United states and China they say they're still room for improvement we're number one if you went first year last\nSo that goes\nTo cities we named market Dr Quinn and medicine woman\nThat double Mountain Dew\nI can quote literally like watched that movie and say the law everybody's lines more entertaining than the news cycle really be my Katy Kirk anyway so the uh\nAside from the little caveat that they had\nAware and they think well we need to you know aside from your social issues ... first off we're doing great economically I think we're pretty good on social issues as well\nIdea of being free with social issues is government regulation of people's behavior\nBeyond don't murder people\nThat's that's that's what they believe it's freedom\nWhich is completely the opposite\nSometimes I feel like the world is just one giant black mirror episode you know what I mean [noise]\nI'm waiting to see if what I said on social media triggered anybody\nI'm sure yes there's the triggering the triggering has commenced\nI really I'm just I'm really read form and there's today\nI'm going to talk about this more coming up but I I

the phrase wars the to enter this country into the ... war than it's hurting Texas\nI mean I'm just gonna say that's like a rhetorical tech he has it's a really annoying\nStop thing I'm I'm I'm a stop it\nI Will I don't even know what his point was there\nHe just wanted to get an insult in\nSaying that his last six years in the Senate somehow what he's asking for the results of his relationship with Trump\nAnd if you can't point to everything economic I mean with jobs including how things were handled with Hurricane Harvey and specifically in the state of Texas um that's the messaging Ted Cruz should be but they do just clearly doesn't even know you just rather would slim without facts and deal with that\nHe's not going to shares thirty million dollars that he raises another Democrat Senate candidates as well\nBut I but socialism the\nBuses socialism\nBut I Do love that he said I work with anytime anywhere anytime anywhere benefit Texan but how does he does do that when he was already called the impeach Trump's\nBut he actually said\nHis response to his plan on border security with to spend more and it's a structure quote our bridges that connect us to Mexico and claw\n'em after talking about we have a problem with money to do and here's the other thing cruise actually noted that beta or work Robert or work\nHis support for the ten dollar per barrel oil tax and Aurora beta responded by calling cruise line pet the line Ted thing came after that\nBecause Ted Cruz accurately noted that data ... supported a ten dollar per barrel oil tax which is going to translate to about twenty four percent or twenty twenty four cents per gallon increase in fuel\nPrice yeah and people out there were stupid and didn't know what the hell they were talking about the one person said no his vote with no to the tax\nHis response to his plan on border security was to spend more infrastructure quote our bridges that connect us to Mexico and ...\nOh man you're talking about we have a problem with money to do and here's the other thing cruise actually noted that beta or work Robert or work\nHis support for the ten dollar per barrel oil tax and or work beta responded by calling cruise lines head the line Ted thing came after this\nBecause Ted Cruz accurately noted that Beto O'Rourke supported a ten dollar per barrel oil tax which is going to translate to about twenty four percent or twenty twenty four cents per gallon increase in fuel\nPrice [noise] yeah and people out there were stupid and didn't know what the hell they were talking about the one person said no his vote with no to the tax\nBut it wasn't because the bill title that he voted no on and I conveniently and hopefully linked the vote\nWas called quote express it was it was the bill title was expressing the sense of Congress opposing the president's proposed ten dollar tax on every barrel of oil and he voted no\nBecause he supported a ten dollar tax on\nEvery barrel of oil\nSo I just think it's hysterical that was so funny for me\nTo see him kind of go back and forth on that but he got mad when Ted Cruz pointed that out and then he started name calling beta or work started name calling when Cruz accurately pointed out hey\nIt's a ten dollar you wanted a ten dollar per barrel oil taxes you wanted\nAnd it's an ... so which was super funny\nThis um\nI just I watched it and I\nHe's just bad

team now officially compared to just being one of the members who's helping other members all the time\nOr you know it's a providing a little more structure in my life I definitely have to carve out a little more time before it was almost like either a friends or are people that I met along the way would say hey can you help me with something and so it was very sporadic but I was happy to do it any time somebody asked\nAnd and now that we've made it official and we have our vast members out there that know that it's my job to help them I get a lot more phone calls and I'm a little bit a busy or

against lady who high and the entire school district this bicycle kick of a mom showed her child just how one should not handle adversity now looking for money or forcing a coach or team to do something is no way to go through life\nThe time for making the varsity team was the months and years of meant preparation that this young person apparently did not take upon himself to get better and to want to keep playing ... as a junior is to take away the same opportunity from those younger players that was a forward it to him\nAs he was supposed to be taking working on his game and what you report what yourself because reports out of St Louis say that the boy is all for taking this case up to the Supreme Court\nThis boy is a junior if he were really good he would already be receiving scholarship offers that he is not says to me that he needs to practice not practiced being a lawyer because he has already missed the greatest lesson a younger person can ever learn\nThe earlier the

he\nWill go back to do on the radio show with me here today is um Mr Scott that Austin is the latest new is the most current multifamily mentor out of the Houston market area Scott's been with the lifestyle for a long time on some of the apartment complexes going after a few more right now\nAnd has been helping people diligently even before he was on the mentoring team so Scott\nI'm gonna ask you the probably the hardest question to ask any mentor\nAnd I don't know sixty days enough for you to come up with a robot answer but maybe just you're eight years of helping people's friends throughout lifestyles may give you a good sense of where I'm going with this and that is what every new mentors I said you know how do you grade yourself as a mentor\nAnd [noise] it's really difficult because you know they said well I Want to grade myself into whatever has failed deal\nAnd you can err on that side by saying OK I'm just going to say no to everything the easiest thing for a mentor to do is to say no to everything\nOr you'll never be wrong no one will ever come back at you and say you were you man you were wrong and that's what I Love it but uh the other side we have the other kind of mentor Scott or we have a few of these guys that are just um I don't come to the right word for it so it's not solving a there\nThey really really really really really want to help you get what you want to the point where maybe they're not using enough of their own personal um ...\nConservative this to shine them from making them yeah restraint and and being able to say you look I Know you really want this I noticed when really you know you really like this\nIt's really difficult because you know he said well I Want to create myself that no one ever has a failed deal\nAnd you can err on that side by saying OK I'm just going to say no to everything the easiest thing for a mentor to do is to say no to everything\nOr you'll never be wrong no one will ever come back at you and say you were you man you were wrong and this one I Love that but uh the other side we have the other kind of mentor Scott a we have a few of these guys that are just um I don't come the right word for it so it's not solving a there they really\nReally really really really want to help you get what you want to the point where maybe they're not using enough of their own personal um ...\nConserve and is this designed them from making yeah restraint and and being able to see how you look I Know you really want this I noticed when really ... you know you really like this but there's quite a few things\nThat you know the red flags go up to her in the back of my next going up this just doesn't seem like the ideal for you um you know there's that balance in the middle where Ninety nine percent of the ... people put your deals end up doing good ones the other one percent of people that don't listen to how to do it why don't you tell me how to do it uh that's the perfect\nAnd then the final indicator is okay how many people by retired and made millionaires out of that's good that's a good score card\nAnd how many people that I've consulted it become national park association winters so I haven't had this conversation with you because you've been so busy since you got here and I've been so busy last couple of weeks also have you thought about any of those parameters constraints as to how you would grade yourself personally as a consultant\nWow I really haven't thought of that you know you hit on a lot of things there that I have seen it sixty days and I've thought about sixty days but I hadn't thought about the overall kinda what do you want your legacy to be a deal and in this uh in what I'm doing now um I can tell you that\nWhen I Am working with people and I've done this and this is part of the lifestyles culture that we try to kind of pushed through and when and\nIf if you talk about people who are doing exactly what we're doing syndicating deals buying deals whatever outside of lifestyle so many times I was in this conversation yesterday\nThose guys make all their money up front on fees and things for putting that deal together and they really don't have a vested interest in what the long term successes or any particular deal\nBecause we invest in every deal that we do in addition to taking other people's money I really look at this and and Curtis did a great job and they multifamily orientation session of talking about the family office and that's kind of a new thought that you play in my head and really figuring out how to maximize my net worth and in effect grow it\nAnd so I look at every deal that way whether\nOr not in it now that I'm a mentor and so the two smaller deals that I've mentor people on there were no brainer sin and when I mentioned before sometimes you got to give them a little shut off the cliff\nThat's what these war they were first deals for these folks but when I looked at him it was like as if you don't make a decision to do this I got twenty other people I'm sure that I Know we'll do this today\nAnd uh and then I took a venture jumped and they're going to be great [noise] um the hundred and sixty four you will\nAlways got Scott ... just so you have the ... that are using the today I called the cattle prod mood you know what do you do with someone who won't take action hit him with the cattle pride and what does that and I used to say it all the time is if you don't do this I'm going to do it or I'm going to give it to somebody else but we're not going to let this would get away so I've always called that have had a ... move\nOkay sorry to a hundred or a hundred and sixty four year deal was one that we had to finance a little bit we had to do a little deeper analysis it wasn't so obvious a good deal um and we ... we had to work at a little bit before we came to grips unfortunately Roger having run his own business and being in six am ideals are so far he's very\nBut when I looked at him it was like as if you don't make a decision to do this I got twenty other people behind you that I Know we'll do this today and uh and then they could potentially jumped and they're going to be great [noise] um the hundred and sixty four you will\nAlways got Scott I'm actually share with you just so you have the ... that are using the today I called the cattle prod mood you know what do you do with someone won't take action hit him in the ... what does that and I used to say it all the time is if you don't do this I'm going to do it or I'm gonna give it to somebody else but we're not going to let this would get away so I've always called that have had all ...\nOkay so you're not going to a hundred and sixty four year deal was one that we had to finance a little bit we had to do a little deeper now says it wasn't so obvious a good deal\nUm and we ... we had to work at a little bit before we came to grips unfortunately Roger having run his own business and being in six am ideals are so far he's very smart very good at at analyzing the numbers\nAnd uh we got through that but it took a little bit of work then that brings us to the the one that I'm working on this afternoon which is the out of town deal\nUm this one doesn't help that it's not in the Houston market where I've been act or\nYou know active for ten years now and I pretty well known sub markets and things like that this one I had to do a little homework on and when he first brought back as an initial analysis I found some things that\nI thought he was trying to favor the deal a little too much and I did have pulling back and say you know my job is to keep you out of a bad deal and here are the concerns that I have he's gone back and massage some of that we've gotten a more farm alone quote which can substantially affect the deal\nAnd so we are going to take another run at it this afternoon so I have seen a little bit of the spectrum I guess in ... deals develop I haven't had a deal yet uh we had one on a a acquisition road trip that a few people were\nPretty heavy on and I did that we can get very deep into it but I came out on the road trip and I said the steel too rich there's not enough upside\nTo this deal to make it worth their while and we and we pulled a couple of people off of that deal um but fortunately we didn't get all without uh due diligence and get everybody's hopes up to invested in the deal but that's that's the biggest problem sometimes you get people that are doing or steel and they're emotionally\nInvested in them and it's hard for them to let go and and that's where I Do see my kind of position here is to make sure that people don't get a little too anxious or lose some patience and make sure the good deal comes along because it took me\nNine months before I got my first deal on a contract and I was completely walk in the gray line between unemployed and self employed for those nine months so uh I was definitely anxious and Emory ah Jacob had to hold me back from doing a bad deal at that time so I've never forgotten that\nYou're not remember the during the rise and so forth you were you an interesting personality your personality fears and nothing\nBut yet you're very analytical and I've had conversations with you and you know after our conversations where it's been like man the worlds coming to an end in we better be careful and then another conversation with you you know what I'm going to go do something way out here over left field we've never done before because I just think it's interesting that my my really pay off\nSo you you got a lot of ah versatility in your personality for being able to consult people\nI Want to ask you next question though and that is this um about a year ago maybe six months I Can't remember time flies you know the last\nCouple of months ago on very quickly but we were sitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you were kind of pulling back saying you know I don't know I'm really kinda the point where I might not do any more deals and uh I might just start buying partners out in in you know changing my position more like yours do ... more of it\nDo something way out here over left field but we've never done before because I just think it's interesting that my my really pay off so you you got a lot of ah versatility in your personality for being able to consult people\nI Want to ask you next question though and that is this a year ago maybe six months I Can't remember type ... you know the last couple of months ago on very quickly but we were sitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you're kind of pulling back saying you know I don't know\nI really kind of at the point where it might not do any more deals and or I might just start by Partridge out and and you know changing my position more like you're dealt with oil ... more of it\nAbsolutely now I'm going to throw in another ... along those same lines and\nI'm going to put words in your mouth which I knows when sanitary but look at it from this point of view about the time that all this came about you found this deal out of eased back where you used to live and it was a good excuse for you to go visit your family\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country\nAnd then the concept came to his for the first time ever that you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units do not have you know yes but it's a lot of properties a lot of unions\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would it be like to take the money and the sophistication and the experience that we've accumulated in this group and taken some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or\nWithout being insulted at least they have less experience than we do and to be able to throw that these properties in the markets outside of the Texas market area\nAnd uh you nailed one\nWe've had four or five others have gotten nailed in the last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people come in the road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston and Dallas and San Antonio in going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to Phoenix and going to uh you know all these different places we had these deals\nAnd they're now saying we've opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I you know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated again\nIt absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right my wife and I are for two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was whereabouts opportunity was so we moved there for a little\nAnd to be able to throw that these properties in the markets outside of the Texas market area and uh you nailed one\nWe've had four or five others have gotten nailed in the last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people come in the road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston and Dallas and San Antonio in going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to being seen going to um you know all these different places we had these deals\nAnd they're now saying we've opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated again\nIt absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right my wife and I are for two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was whereabouts opportunity was so we moved there for a little while before we moved back to Houston and\nBeginning of last year I had went on a big junk mail a campaign and so I started an subscribing to all these things to creep into your mailbox overtime for signing up for various things and I sit on the couch with a a football game or something on he was on the other end of the couch down whatever she was doing on her laptop\nAnd I was an subscribing and deleting all this junk mail and one of the things that happened they are a which is one of the big brokers here in town and they are national\nOr had gotten bought by Cantor Fitzgerald and when that happened I had been on their website and I had set preferences so I only got deals and the Houston metropolitan area at the time that I started doing this I said why would anybody have to leave a city like Houston there's so much opportunity here to do any of this\nAnd I had I stated rule that if I couldn't drive to it and be home\nBy the end of the day I didn't need to own\nSo ah anyway as I'm sorting and and I didn't batch delete I was just hitting delete delete delete scrolling through the subject lines the Cincinnati deal pops up\nAnd I went huh and I clicked on it and I very quickly from looking at so many deal sized up that if this was in Houston, Texas it was a no brainer and they would sell for a lot more than the price was on this a posting that I saw\nAnd so yeah I asked my wife what do you think about finance deal out of town and we got a business excuse to go fly up there a couple times a year and see all those friends that were left behind Twenty years ago when we came back to Houston\nThat she sent out whatever you want to do if you want to manager said but it means that I've never had to do this but I'm probably gonna be gone at least one night a month going up there just to make sure everything's still running right she said that's fine you know our our two girls were out of the house by this time and we just have one kid left there so things are manageable if you'd like to try and do it so we ended up doing it\nUm I went to my three a kind of largest investors that have long term vision and I said guys a little bit of a flyer but while you're back you know the steel and they were all in\nAnd we did the deal is been phenomenal the ah we bonded since August of last year\nWe're on pace to return Nineteen percent cash on cash and our first year of ownership Brennan interest only period so things are\nObviously cash along really well but it's a fifty five and over high you'll play a property not not a a value play that we're having fixed up\nAnd we kept saying management group in fact it was a neutron and we're really well so I saw no reason to shake things up there we put it a little bit of ... and we're making it even more efficient so that when the principal kicks and our cash on cash probably won't have to tip\nWill just a cover it with our increased rats that we are getting out of this place\nSo uh that's a great place I was actually up there about three weeks ago I guess and they\nReally wanted one of my investors who is from Battle Creek Michigan founded a lifestyles on the radio show and came down here to invest they wanted him at the Detroit road show that you guys had about three weeks ago and he couldn't be there so I got to go up and be surrogate and help out and really kinda tell his story and how we met down here and now we're investing in other markets up there and I got to tell you a J. B.\nThe cash flowing really well but it's a fifty five and over high your play a property not not a a value play that we're having fix up\nAnd we kept saying management group in fact it was a neutron and we're really well so I sort of reasons to shake things up there we put it a little bit of cap action or make it even more efficient so that when the principal kick sand or cash on cash probably won't have to tip\nWill just a cover it with our increased threats that we are getting out of this place so uh that's a great place I was actually up there about\nThree weeks ago I guess and they really wanted one of my best friend who was from Battle Creek Michigan founded a lifestyles on the radio show and came down here to our best and wanted him at the Detroit road show that you guys had about three weeks ago and he couldn't be there so I got to go up and be surrogate and\nHelp out and really kind of tell his story and how we met down here and now we're investing in other markets up there and\nI tell you a J. B. David Durham\nHad a phenomenal presentation and not only walking around Detroit we were staying downtown walking the streets at ten thirty at night from a restaurant that we went out to the night before the event and\nI went into Detroit with a bad attitude and walked away completely changed they've got a lot of metrics that look really good up there\nAnd I think they are probably a pretty well poised to to have some great things going on we have members as as you said that found the show or most of them came down to Dallas and so it was the closest place to fly into or drive two and a did their their\nStudies they invested a some deals there and now they're doing deals in and around Detroit Michigan a\nBorder to go to places we're gonna take a break right there's got to come back

this was this was stunning but not necessarily surprising about the rapid expansion of wiccan and witchcraft in the United states\nIt is truly incredible well its nature of horrors a vacuum I don't know who said that was a sir Isaac Newton I don't know I don't know who set up but it's true nature apple horrors a vacuum you can't have em truly empty space\nWithout something rushing in to fill it and when the leftist because they hate God because you can't deal with their own then hey got hey Jesus said the Bible hate everything they want to have been very successful and driving Christian influence\nInto the underground almost in this country starting with Madeline Marie O'Hare back in the early sixties\nWell if that creates a vacuum something's going to fill up\nThe secularists are fine was secular humanism manners all there is an all there needs to be the end without man uh nothing can be accomplished in because there's man exists all things are possible while that course all of that as a bunch of hooey piled high in deep otherwise known as a PHD however\nOther things are filling that void beyond secular humanism\nAnd the witchcraft explosion in this country is just that based on surveys done by a particular college in Connecticut called trinity college which has been studying this for some time and tracking it all the way back to Nineteen nineties twenty eight years ago they started they\nSaid that in Nineteen Ninety they had determined that there were approximately eight thousand practicing wiccan Z\nOr witchcraft in the United states eight thousand in two thousand and eight\nEighteen years later ten years ago there were three hundred and forty thousand\nAre you going to hold of this and Eighteen years the number of practicing which is in the United states has gone from eight thousand to treat three hundred and forty thousand the estimate today using these rates\nAre progression in their algorithms that all they how they calculate this weather others the stuff that these guys do the determined that there are now approximately one hundred and fifty four I'm Sorry one point five\nMillion a practicing which is in the United states now it's less than one percent and I will tell you this if they vote they all vote Democrat that's a fact I'm not being snooty snotty or city here which is a vote Democrat\nBecause of value is which is they're very much into child sacrifice which is abortion they're very much into moral perversion which is Saddam and all the things the Democrats seem to be entirely enamored with because\nThey can't deal with their own sense so they have to force their failed philosophy on other unsuspecting generations also known as schoolchildren\nSo the rejection of Christianity is left to avoid and people\nSays here and there's a star story wicker has effectively been repackaged for millennial consumption now witchcraft doesn't focus so much on the pagan is Dixie panic in the demonic it now it's starting to promote areas are free thought understanding\nOf earth and nature\nBut she'll get\nWhich is a vote\nDemocrat because of value is which is there are very much into child sacrifice which is abortion they're very much into moral perversion which is Saddam and all the things the Democrats seem to be entirely enamored with because\nThey can't deal with their own sense so they have to voice their failed philosophy on other unsuspecting generations also known as schoolchildren\nSo the rejection of Christianity is left to avoid and people\nSays here and there's a star story Wicca has effectively been repackaged for millennial consumption now witchcraft doesn't focus so much on the pagan is stick said panic and the demonic\nIt now it's starting to promote areas are free thought understanding of earth and nature\nBut you'll get end quote but you'll get down to the basics the or worship of loose suffer when it's all said and done continuing the quote here is the sad thing is that millennials who are exploring the dark side of the supernatural seemed to have more faith and belief in most Christians\nThey're open their spiritually hungry and the spirit realm in this particular case the dark spiritual realm responds\nThe biggest hindrance to understanding the realities of spirit realm is on belief they set wealth ... believe it they actually embrace it stronger than a lot of Christians this is what's interesting the number of which is and I commented on this\nA few weeks ago how the wiccan the which is now have their own or the room and worship area in the basement of the chapel\nThe chapel yet that the Christian chapel at the air force academy in Colorado Springs and why are they in the basement well two reasons first of all on your way up from hell would not the basement be the first room you'd come to\nA number to the basement is the foundation scripture says if the foundation be destroyed what can the rights as do that's where the enemy goes is after that but there are more\nThere are now more which is in the United states than there are in the Presbyterian Church usa that's right the peace usa the largest Presbyterian denomination has ... has fewer people in it than there are which is\nBut maybe there's overlapping membership who knows [laughter] [noise]\nA one other quick thing and then we're going to get onto ... record thing's great things were going to get out onto our issues of the Democrats and the violence and the importance of this election\nAnd this is a study that now shows that the majority of people who call themselves ... records you can call yourself anything you know what\nI could call myself Chinese and it doesn't make me Chinese a guy who call myself whatever I caught myself super intelligent but that doesn't make me super intelligent we all know that\nA majority of suppose ... Christian now believe that God except for worship\nOf all religions all religions it doesn't matter that you're wiccan apparently\nIt's just our youth sincere in your wiccan belief that is important sincerity is trumping correctness\nFolks is was horribly dangerous and all I can say is if that's the way these supposed Evans overlook all Christians believe they are Christians and they certainly aren't ...\nI could call myself Chinese and it doesn't make me Chinese a guy who call myself whatever I call myself a super intelligent but that doesn't make me super intelligent we all know that a majority of suppose Evan jello crushed Christians now believe that God except\nFor worship of all religions all religions\nIt doesn't matter that you're wiccan apparently\nIt's just argue sincere in your wiccan belief that is important sincerity is trumping correctness\nFocus was horribly dangerous\nAnd all I can say is if that's the way these supposed Evansville are Christians believe they are Christians and they certainly aren't having jello jiggle\nOr man I hey you know and by their fruit right one last item here before we break loose and go heavy on democratic violence and the consequences of what it means to you and\nOf a transition piece from what happened at the hearings to what we apparently can expect in the future\nQuote\nThe hysterics so the past few weeks has indeed not whether and well on America's so called the feminine ... who demonstrated once again that they allow feelings to rule over rational thought and logic\nAnd their attempt to run nominee Brett Kavanaugh out of dodge by protesting his confirmation hearings their antics have shown just how ridiculous\nNonsensical emperor posh preposterous they are [noise] are ironically they're using female hysteria\nTo get away with anarchy\nI got a repeat that this is just so true and so concise they're using female hysteria to get away with anarchy today we refer to these hysterical barking had eggs keep in mind these are not my words and these are words coming from a woman writing this\nToday we refer to these barking hysterical barking hangs as men haters\nAre radical feminists are college professors these hysterical heartbeat didn't call a press conference to challenge decisions no\nThey threw themselves at the doors to the hearing room sobbing and clogging up the doors they collapsed in the hallways of the capital and they had to be dragged away they dressed as handmade inflamed Kavanaugh will enforce a dystopian uh\nSo concise they're using female hysteria to get away with anarchy today we refer to these hysterical barking bags keep in mind these are not my words and these are words coming from a woman writing this\nToday we refer to these barking hysterical barking hangs as man haters are radical feminists are college professors\nThese hysterical heartbeat didn't call a press conference to challenge decisions no they threw themselves at the doors to the hearing room sobbing and clawing up the doors they collapsed\nIn the hallways of the capital and they had to be dragged away they dressed as handmade inflamed Kavanaugh will enforce a dystopian America where women have no rights and are forced to have children for the ruling class I got to stop your second\nThese are the left us who are only complaining of whining ... about\nA ruling class that doesn't exist so that they could become the ruling class which actually does exist back to the quote\nThe ambush senators in elevators cornering them aggressively simultaneously screaming and crying and the thing the women cry about toxic masculinity I'll share a bus seat any day with a man's brought her over a shrieking barking heartbeat\n[laughter]\nThis is a mile behavior cannot be allowed\nThis is not peaceful assembly much of the behavior of these violent or over rocked Krohn is dangerous one level of antics lead other groups\nOf nasty orders to upped the ante and try something even more hysterical an even more dangerous than they're misguided attempt\nAt achieving total anarchy\n\nIran's just stop here a second I'm going to continue for a minute\nYou need to get the speech this is this is so well stated\nContinue perhaps it is a good thing that these women are paid protesters because what they are hysterical demonstrations they also demonstrated that they are unemployable for one employer would hire even one of these toxic nasty women\nWhen they don't get their way or they feel put down or insulted you can bet they'd turn their entire company on end with threats of civil rights violations and legal action\nThese women are not serious civil libertarians they are rich in his shoes seeking to tear down institutions their anarchists seeking power and control a country that reviled them\n\nEvery feminists are not paying under this call I got to repeat myself these are not my words this was written by a woman back to the quote and I'm going to end with this every feminist I've ever met has had an abortion\nThey've led teen and college years full of promiscuity alcohol and drugs they're mostly white they're mostly middle to upper class mostly educated unspoiled they rebelled against decent parents\nAnd the boredom of living in normal virtuous\nLife and quote Katie\nThat was just over the top those so good\nAnd control a country that reviled them\nEvery feminists are not paying under this call I got to repeat myself these are not my words this was written by a woman back to the quote and I'm going to end with this every feminist I've ever met has had an abortion\nThey've led teen and college years full of promiscuity alcohol and drugs they're mostly white they're mostly middle to upper class mostly educated unspoiled they rebelled against decent parents\nAnd the boredom of living in normal virtuous\nLife and called Katy that was just over the top\nThose so good Katie Grimes and the title of the pieces Kavanaugh hearings hysterical barking Druze must be prosecuted you want to look it up get it\nUse it for fighter as you deal with your leftist friends you're left wing family members who you can't stand it get around at Christmas and Thanksgiving because all they do is harp about Trump and pretty soon you're not eating the turkey you're throwing the drum sticks in each other\n[noise] ah [noise] you need some animal so there you go\nSo\nWe have how 'bout this one the ... patriot prayer rally in Portland so it goes bloody\nSo\nThis group march is the Patriot prayer groups marches and who shows up the counterprotesters the antifa the smile that the primarily white\nSpoiled little Darryl acts that call themselves and teeth are Occupy Wall street sometimes\nAugmented by black lives matter\nI'm Sorry you know what their ... but not much that sort of a separate thing but the worst of the violence should the violence as far as the just routine\nOr a vandalism and torturing of buildings fire bombing spray painting taking clubs to a and things to beat people up with wherever somebody is speaking that they don't like is largely a leftist spoiled white contingent\nAdjust is\nThere though there are the children of the professors I had in school well\nLike most things the conservatives don't bring\nThe fight to the protesters the protestors are counterprotesters bring the fight to the conservatives who are marching and praying with their flags like the Patriot prayer rally but listen to how the Oregonian that describes this event quote\nParticipants were the conservative patriot prayer group and counter demonstrators with anti if I got into a bloody mainly outside a popular bar were members on both sides used to be your spray I'm ... I'm Sorry\nSay hey you know what if that's all they were doing they would have had a good time I suppose used the bearer spray fish and baton to beat each other\nYou see this is what the left wing rags like the Oregon in which isn't good enough to even used for training your dog this is what they do\nThey paint a certain equality between the groups even the group in Charlottesville which I didn't support a bunch of racist they didn't bring the fight to the fight the counterprotesters brought the fight to them this has happened one huh\nQuote participants were the conservative patriot prayer group and counter demonstrators with antifa got into a bloody mainly outside a popular bar were members on both sides used the beer spray I'm ... I'm Sorry\n[noise] hey hey you know what if that's all they were doing they would have had a good time I suppose news the bearer spray fish and baton to beat each other\nYou see this is what the left wing rags like the Oregon and which isn't good enough to even use for training your dog this is what they do\nThey paint a certain equality between the groups\nEven the group in Charlottesville which I didn't support a bunch of racist they didn't bring the fight to the fight the counterprotesters brought the fight to them\nThis has happened one hundred percent of the time\nBut these left wing rags to Oregon and portray it as both sides are involved in a matter of equality there both fighting look I'll tell you why they're conservatives are bringing a ... tons of things to the marches for one good reason self defense\nAnd the next time if they're armed they're going to be armed for reasons of self defense and I would encourage them\nTo do so so we have\nThis anger we got this theory this hatred hatred the shrieking choir of Madden lifting weights as Daniel Greenfield we'll call them they scream at the sky having meltdowns\nListen to what the left is saying\nAre saying these are these are articles folks are usually the titles of articles written by various left wing organizations like the New York's lines or the Washington compost grow we need to saying angry about Kavanaugh\nAbout this one get angry and get involved or this one hears fury inaction how do you express anger about this one theory is a political weapon and women need to wield it\nLook at these articles they're all about violence this is what the left does the left\nIs about ... the left is taking us in the same direction as the world went before God destroyed it with a flood go look read about the flood starting in genesis chapter six and what does it say the world was filled with violence that is what God was sorry and made man\nBecause somewhere when he made man there ended up being some Democrats\nAnd I'll listen I Am not raising Republicans to the scene of a virtue they're not to the pinnacle of perfection and purity by no means there's a whole bunch of Republicans that frankly make me want to hurl but there are some good ones\nBut I Can't find any good Democrats not a single one you look at their platform unless they're totally stupid or abysmally ignorant there's no way you could embrace what they embrace\nTotally stupid or abysmally ignorant there's no way you could embrace what they embrace\nI'm Sorry because you're going to be a block\nYou want to learn how to make money flipping houses right here in Phoenix if so we have an amazing opportunity for you were looking for a small group of motivated individual to join our real estate investing team\nYou learn are simple three steps them for flipping homes right here in the local area but it's just stand Merrill store any hit TV show flipped this house my team and\nI are looking for a handful of people in the Phoenix area who want to learn how to make money flipping out in your spare time using other people's money Phoenix and they have a market for my system and this week I'm holding a free to our educational workshop where you will learn how to make money flipping around and how to build long term wealth with income property\nTo get to free tickets to fans workshop touched your five digits a code to eighty two thousand seeding is extremely limited so texture five digits a code to eighty two thousand right now because this free ticket offer expires this Friday\nJust you're listening to independent to eleven hundred K.

strategies I'm going to basically summing up by saying you need to be diverse of pie but not diversified stocks bonds cash but diversified among different strategies\nOn the investment side as you grow money for retirement or just regular investing and especially as you look to take any income and retirement\nIf you look in all the thinking out there and all the ideas people have different ways to approach this you know you look at um different articles TV shows other radio shows\nYou know they're always asking you know I Wonder what's the best strategy was the best strategy to use or maybe somebody's promoting certain strategies\nYou know sometimes that maybe are based on experience maybe sometime in the bake based on a lack of experience\nBut one thing is you look at different ideas of how to make this work and let me share some ... was shall we did some ideas basically you have ideas dealing with a me I could break it down maybe into three categories and then some are summarize it up in a different way you have some of those who\nSay that you should be following fundamentals you know basically looking at economic data then you have somebody of people talking about technical ideas maybe looking at price movement so you know the price of the stock and moving certain ways we should buy or sell it\nThen you also have what they called the quantitative deserve their clients are looking at a statistic some probability when if you know there's you know no no systems are really going to be right and all marketing environments you know again every strategy is going to work until it doesn't\nMaybe it's better to look at maybe a diversification among the different type of strategies but also tiny and risk management\nSo instead of using what they call like a light switch strategies or strength standalone strategies\nYou know which maybe help maybe limit you may be helping one time but maybe don't help and one other times maybe we can look at an approach that looks at a combination or you know a a a a allocation among the different strategies but always\nTying in risk management so what happens if you did fall one strategy it's possible that the trigger may go off and you may not be invested you know or you may be fully invested\nAnd so but it may not be the ... and its move you know the trigger may be get out of the market but maybe instead of getting getting out of a hundred percent maybe there's some alternative way to look at this\nSo what do you do well maybe you look at what they call you know looking at your core and your diverse in and\nLike your satellite for meaning you're basically your basic ideas your basic approaches trying to build a portfolio based on this for\nA poor you know poor poor strategies are the basic strategy and then you can make sense some small amounts of the satellite strategies you know there may be outside maybe some active by an active\nUh NASDAQ a market timing idea alternative investment ideas like that but always\nTime in a risk management factor why because we want to grow the money and we also want to minimize the down terms\nYou know even the tiny amount to fix side you know the fixed income the bond side that's been taken not too good of a hit this year right you know interest rates creeping up Federal Reserve raising interest rates and I'm a bond values going down but there are still some fixed income strategies\nBuild a portfolio based on this for a poor you know poor poor strategies are the basic strategy and then you can make sense some small amounts of the satellite strategies you know there are maybe outside maybe some act of bon active\nUh NASDAQ a market timing idea alternative investment ideas like that but always time in a risk management factor why because we want to grow the money and we also want to minimize the down terms\nYou know even the tiny amount of fix side you know the fixed income the bond side that's been taken not too good of a hit this year right you know interest rates creeping up Federal Reserve raising interest rates\nAnd I'm a bond values going down but there are still some fixed income strategies that have still over time done that have done perform well and actually this year are performing not too bad you know right now interest rates are basically almost doubled\nWhere they were a year or so ago\nAnd the index that track you know like short term bond and bond index as they're all negative for the year\nBut if you look at some strategies using like short duration income or floating rate income\nMaybe some more stable type of a values there are actually using good returns right now and they're basically either break even are positive for the year you know have raised in a it takes advantage of rising interest rates\nAre looks to not have like a long duration so they're not can clobbered by\nA price moments you know on bond so but again you know everybody's different you know again we want to plan before you invest in the sharing with you some idea on the investment side because of what we're what we saw last week and the thought process of what's going to happen going forward\nAnd never predict you know investments in the investment or more of a market you know somebody said they can predict what's going to happen\nAnd you know that's good for them but history has shown that you know it's very hard to predict and a lot of productions do not come true it's always easy to say everything everything's going to go bad because eventually something does turned bad\nBut uh you don't want to be sitting on the sidelines 'cause you're still want to grow their money but you want to protect and in case\nAnd that again come into play as one of the risk factors involved in retirement planning dealing with the sequence of returns you know what return or you're going to get before he retired and what you're going to get return wise on your money or investments right after you retire\nIn a couple that with taking money out in retirement how's that going to affect you know so you know you look at you know go back to two thousand seven two thousand they somebody just retired that started taking money out of their accounts and all of a sudden\nYou know maybe they're just holding onto their accounts and uh they they lose and you know thirty forty percent in the market\nAnd so you know and then you know they you know the the money comes back and recovered right he comes back to the main back to the average kind of like that Sports Illustrated concept\nYou know the the athlete there but um you

I'm not saying that's going to happen again but that's a very good return yeah that's a good period of time right ... over twelve point seven five percent on average during the Twenty years but there were five years when there were negative returns\nOne was only a negative three and negative four or five negative seven more with the negative uh fourteen point six of another with a negative twenty six point five\nDuring the first two years what happens if you have her investments when she starts taking money out of retirement if she experienced a decline I'm In the best memorial so let's say that I'm sixty five year old with two million dollars is going to planned needs a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to live on\nIt's going to take that out of their retirement accounts at a good high percentage to take out or you know maybe more than four percent obviously but um let's say you're going to take that and if I'm required minimum distributions ... show end up taking that amount in the future\nSo what happens over time if you do the numbers and you know it's hard to see on the radio but I got in front of me here but I Try to communicate that to you\nIf you've experienced those returns that I talked about from Nineteen Seventy two I'm from Nineteen Seventy three and nice to Nineteen Ninety to\nCheck out the two million dollars took out a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nEnds up getting over three million dollars obviously three million dollars in income and has about eight hundred and fifty nine thousand five hundred dollars left after Twenty years not too bad right got a lot of an income three million still as a almost two million left\nYou know and hopefully that will survive if she lived another ten or Fifteen Years or so\nBut when I was if you look at a different approach with a look at a different approach instead of this taking out the hundred and fifty thousand dollars or the investment account\nEvery year we didn't give you as an alternative strategy a different place to grab that money that wasn't subject to the stock market wasn't stuck subject dancers rates wasn't such ... subject to inflation and if you had health care you'd still issues you have health care is still get that income\nWeapons if those down years those five down years instead of taking out from your accounts that this person took it out from the alternative side\nAnd took money from from uh the uh different investments whether it's still money invested in some type of a ... income uh generating type of uh a program through the annuities [noise] you know they'll guarantee back by claims paying ability of the insurance company that offers the annuity\nOr even through a life insurance plan maybe you know built up money on life insurance and able to take money out of structural properly tax free\nWell in this example this person had saved additional money inside of life insurance policy ends up taking out the money\nTo inflation and if you had healthcare you'd still issues you have health care is still get that income\nWhat happens if those down years those five down years instead of taking out from your accounts that this person took it out from the alternative side\nAnd took money from from it they are different investments whether it's still money invested in some type of a ... income uh generating type of a program through the annuities [noise] you know they'll guarantee backed by claims paying the ability of the insurance company that offers ...\nOr even through life insurance plan maybe you know built up money on life insurance and able to take money out of structure properly tax free\nWell in this example this person had saved additional money inside of life insurance policy ends up taking out the money in ... in those negative years not from her investment but from our insurance policy but because it's tax free doesn't have to take out a hundred and fifty thousand\nOnly has to take a lot from that the net out what she would have taken after taxes ends up after those Twenty years ended up getting more a little bit more than three million dollars of income\nBecause there wasn't as a you know wasn't taxes on it\nBut ended up with a balance in the existing two million dollar IRA with over five million dollars because she didn't experience those negative returns for five years or five years and whether I'm withdrawing that money for those five years\nAgain it's everybody's different as of may be a stretch example but there's something to get you thinking that perhaps\nThere's another way to look at the planning process and look at the numbers of how to protect what you have saved still generate that income and then have that income not subject that much to the stock market fluctuations not subject to much to answer stray\nMovements whatever the Federal Reserve that are not subject to inflation because you'll be able to give yourself a raise overtime\nRight and then you know looking at 'em or if there was a health care issue there that income will still can continue to come into the house\nIdeas some different ideas that I'm here to help you with maybe explore give me a call reach me through

saying so here we are in the imperfect world try to bring some shots of perfection innocent perfect world and we're talking about topics that most people are not interested in it\nBecause I Would instead immediately shifted the word immigration\nImmigration immigration immigration tons are is\nYou'd be interested more and you you might want to actually you should\nBecause as I said today

it coming from a FM you have to dig very hard to get any answers on this at all\nBecause it's very serious that can lead to paralysis and deaths in children\nOn October fourth health officials in

there what you like to go to vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits of horses\nSo every every article says the causes of FM are still unclear\nIt's unclear we don't do anything\nBut it's

from these third world countries in plain English common sense would dictate you know let a disease partially then your country\nI common sense if you have a house or apartment we let someone with a a communicable disease in your apartment unless you're a moron and San Francisco and San Francisco probably sleep with the person with a communicable disease to show it a good life just they were very bright them in a kiss them on the lips the show is good good people they are that's how sick they are\nBut if you have a say nation you say no I don't want to get sick\nSo what I'm saying the you

them the help that they need but you don't bring 'em in unless you're insane\nDoesn't make sense I mean you have to be a genius to figure out what I just said I guess so today no one thinks they don't think look I exist in this business because of one reason a\nI'm offering you something that you're buying let's put it to you that way and you don't you think about it\nWhen you really thinking about what us talk radio ... which talk radio shows are successful and which aren't which are long lasting and which aren't it's no longer related to um whether you survive in this business or not it's no wonder related to ratings for example a New York uh WABC I had the highest ratings for years I had any for three straight\nBut they want to go in another direction you only hear me into your come January unless you either ... or or for another station or you'll listen to my podcast my writings were great that wasn't the reason it's all politics I Can't do anything about it\nThere's nothing I can do about the politics of the ownership of stations do you understand that I don't own a stations they could run Mickey Mouse playing it because you if they wanted for three hours in in in a slot that I was going to do sound better than Mickey Mouse or the zoo\nAnd you can say what do you want but you don't have any control over it doesn't matter if the show loses money doesn't matter at all that matters is that the agenda is push forward especially going into twenty twenty when they get they're gearing up ready for the presidential election\nSo the only reason you listen to me at all is why\nWell you figure this guy's a little different sometimes it comes down on this side of a of a subject sometimes that and it seems like he does it based on a reason not just on on a desire to please us and he doesn't sit for three hours saluting Trump\nWhich you can gag on that one because I did not Trump that I'm angry at it's the talk show host who thinks that that's all you want to hear that the part that bothers me what would you do if if Obama was president and you ought to talk\nIf they wanted for three hours in in in a slot that I was and we're not going to do sound better than Mickey Mouse where they can do\nAnd you can say whatever you want but you don't have any control over it doesn't matter if the show loses money doesn't matter at all that matters is that the agenda is

you do if if Obama was president and you had a talk show that for three straight hours it's diluted how great Obama was Obama was there so but I'm always great Obama shoes shine ... probably than anyone shoe bomber was smarter how could you listen to that did you listen to it no\nNo the the companies that specialize in left wing propaganda\nIn radio one out of business and then when they lost their jobs they came over to the other stations and they started to get rid of conservatives taking them off the air you don't know any of this oh yeah it's a well known fact in the business\nPeople destroyed their networks by running left wing propaganda and now running other media now did you know that even in radio well in one day you'll you'll learn more about it if it's false I wouldn't say it to you so how do you survive at all in this business if you're a truth teller\nThe people will find you one way or the other\nIs that simple they'll find your on line or they'll find you on a podcast or they'll string it from somewhere that's that's how it is so is that that's the way it is now ... what are we going to talk about let's go to I didn't take a call I got this one of these days I don't know why it's so good\nI Know why I feel good extra extra clear it's like a clear like Scientology a clear I don't I'm not a psychologist but I Know one guy was in it\nEarly on back in Queens he went into it\nOne of the nuts and the crowd\nStar but he made a fortune became a top guy and sinus I was surprised it went so high up in this thing\nBut he wasn't like kids Eighteen everyone's trying to find themselves he became a Scientology I'm Talking ... like in the sixties and I'll wake up twenties ladies like one of the chief school rules in Scientology movement but I remember the guy there were certain things they said they were really good\nLike about headaches for example I have suffered migraine since I was a kid\nAnd he tried to have me image the headache and where it came from it actually helped me\nOr really helped my migraines and self cured\nWas reading Georgia sours than Mac robotics and I went on to the ten stage diet of elimination I was Eighteen years old and on my own I found out which which food types trigger migraines\nAnd I rarely get a migraine today unless I slip on that diet for me it was sucrose any any refined sugars will do it for example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast\nAnd if it's like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that engine will run on it\nBut you're going to burn the engine out with my brain was sending back a single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn through fast and burn up that seat that's right feedback in your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signal and you want to understand that\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain and your body you actually could could lead yourself to states have health that you could never even believe were were possible but and here is the but\nMost of us have lost contact with the signals we don't want to hear them we've we've eliminated them\nAnd we put your budget or whatever where they would do is I've learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always a nice message [laughter] sometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink ... shut up leave me alone you know\nFor example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast and if it's like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that engine will run on it but you're going to burn the engine out whether it's in my brain was sending back a single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn through fast and burn up the seat that's right feedback and your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signal and you want to understand that\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain and your body you actually could could lead yourself to states of health that you could never even believe were were possible but and here's the but\nMost of us have lost contact with these signals we don't want to hear them we've we've eliminated them\nWe put your budget or whatever what he would do\nIs I've learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always a nice message [laughter] sometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink ... shut up leave me alone you know I don't ... don't drink that rockets not good for you today whatever but I I listen all very close relationship\nSo I took this an acrobatic diet did elimination of sucrose insured my headache and the rest is history for me it doesn't mean for you maybe you love sucrose maybe like getting diabetes and cancer\nAnd heart disease I Can't stop you if that's what you want\nPeople do crazy things today based on science so the reason I'm happy today on radio was I was able to use\nMy my learning\nMy dissertation going back to Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... study studies that I was interested in them and the relationship to Lou Gehrig's disease today\nAnd the statement by Steven all kinds of God doesn't exist because he died of allies I figured that would be interesting but do I know if you really listening or maybe you listen to have it already I don't know you're going to turn off the list in that habit by now because you could hear everything you've ever wanted to know about the administration are graded is around the clock\n... bat\nThat part down the middle of his hair and you know it's a terrible thing to be a good looking boy\nAnd become not so good looking and you're middle aged man\nWhile I don't know what it's like to be like I was never like a handsome guy was like and not know what I'm saying so I was okay\nI had my share of fun but\nWhat I'm saying is what if you live on your looks and you have nothing underneath no education and no no intellect whatsoever and you make a fortune and finally you look in the mirror and no matter what you do you have to park your hair in the middle and looked like a Lou Costello\nIn order to to cover up to the thinning hair and so you get increasingly desperate to be young and you start breaking bricks with your hand\nAnd then the whole mask manhood thing comes up\nAnd the people while they don't call your tiny I mean that was a terrible thing to do with the president I'm Talking about people in the media they'll call you tiny that's nothing to do with anything where the size have to do with brains you know what does everything have to be everything some people are in doubt mentally summer in doubt physically someone that I Would vote someone that I Would nothing that's the human condition what are you gonna do about it\nBut if you're in the media and you're thriving based on your good looks you're a good guy looks and you had asked us to stand on your face starts to look like Jerry Lewis after it tell us on a in the seventies and there's nothing you can do about it\nI don't know what that's like that's a that's a form of torture and its own way and then as the years go on the portrait of Dorian Gray gets more and more corrupted you know I I don't know I think God in his own way has a little way of playing with people who think that they're bigger than God you know\nYou have any idea what I'm Talking about\nLearning out there knows what I'm even talking about I Wonder sometimes I think there'll be like if I run into people strangely and what's increasingly happening to me is that people have different\nCultural backgrounds of stopping me in the street like a\nYesterday I had the day off writes I've got to a dentist or something just a nice lady said hello to me like she knew me\nSo I went up and said hello she's from Cambodia and she sent me very quietly she said I Lived through it\nAfter a tell us on a in the seventies and there's nothing you can do about it\nI don't know what that's like that's that's a form of torture and its own way\nAnd then as the years go on the portrait of Dorian Gray gets more and more corrupted you know I I don't I think God on his own way has a little way of playing with people who think that they're bigger than God you know\nYou have any idea what I'm Talking about\nLearning out there knows what I'm even talking about I Wonder

check out every day Alexandria thank you for joining me uh let me start broad word twenty days out right now I'm it appears that when it comes to the United States Senate there's momentum for Republicans Ga\nI think that's exactly right read on where we are and that was always the case I mean looking at the map if you're always favorable to Republicans given are so many democratic incumbent up for re election that Donald Trump won and twenty sixteen but I think you know even the momentum now as clearly as favoring Republicans perhaps even more therapy retired\nI'm intrigued Alexandra by a ... a couple of races I saw a debate a couple of nights ago in Arizona a mix Shelley against cinema um give me give me your thoughts on this race it appears to still be neck in neck\nI think so I and we haven't as far as I've seen there hasn't been a new poll in the last couple of days but I'm awaiting very early at the most recent polling that rate at over the last couple of days in particular some really interesting stories that come out about ... than a moderate Democrat\nIn the race um and she apparently has passed or being intensely opposed the Iraq War protesting our

incompetent retiring at least in part a presumably because I started that effort in fact a Republican is resonating an estate anymore for some reason I think a big part of that it\nChanging demographics that you know at the state was pretty close and twenty sixteen is not your standard Republican voter there and so I think um\nUm you know down the list of ... strange kind of even

you surprised a that cinema is doing as well as she's doing in Arizona and and the only reason I ask is I Know Martha ... she's a strong military she's got a really strong record\nI guess I'm

twenty sixteen is not your standard\nRepublican voter there and so I think I'm perhaps and I'm always able to sort of capture the messaging with more of an Arizona style and you come across as lots of progressive than she actually is that in a field people\nNow we're a last question Arizona I Know that Trump is coming in I think before the weeks out how does Trump play in a state like that\nI think that's actually a tough question I'm a I'm a little bit surprised to see him going out there already um but I Do think at the same time there have been some victories in something like border security

time to read them again and again because there's so much\nInformation in each book\nTonight sketched is humor\nAnd Bernie stories and just as an example of some of the questions Bernie and list is what are some of the benefits of humor\nPhysically emotionally and mentally and cute and can humor be considered a natural medicine for healing process\nTo the show Bernie thank you my dear\nYeah I'm so convinced about humor because I did see the benefits as a visitation I saw the benefits are with all my patients and one of the things I found interesting was that\nMany times I Will meet patients\nWho you know I'm no longer practice things innovation anymore but will be you know going shopping or sitting at the vet a waiting room and they come over and say remember me and what they remember is the humor\nUm I might say the loving the humor that those two things\nAnd how they were able to survive a in a lot less painful way are due to the love and the laughter and I always say that [noise] if you're laughing\nYou can't be afraid mhm here he is not an issue when you're laughing\nAnd I mean that literally just disconnects you from the fear and this is why I Would use it all the time with my patients so they wouldn't\nUh confronted disease you know what's gonna happen to me\nOr an operation with fear or they'd go in with a smile on their face and I'm always come out far better as a matter of fact one of the nurses says to me your patients that are a problem I said my patients are a problem what is it\nThey refuse pain medication\nI said did it ever occur to you they're not hurting\nI always say that [noise] if you're laughing\nYou can't be afraid mhm here is not an issue when you're laughing\nAnd I mean that literally just disconnects you from the fear and this is why I Would use it all the time with my patient so they wouldn't uh confronted disease you know what's gonna happen to me\nOr an operation with fear or they'd go in with a smile on their face and I'm always come out far better as a matter of fact one of the nurses said to me if patients that are a problem I said my patients are problem what is it\nThey refuse pain medication\nI said did it ever occur to use it not hurting\nShe looks at me like I was insane because I've been doing major surgery on people and they're not hurting\nBut they they weren't\nI mean in terms of pain they weren't in pain there may have been ... or\n\n[noise]\nWell welcome to the matter with Dr Bernie Segal during the break or earning they talking about you mentioned about research which is I find interesting research as far as what's happens to the body what's it mentally physically emotionally or\nYeah one of the medical students at the university I don't know if he's medical psychology but you know in that in the health field um\nEight do this professor for his faces when\nHe wanted to do was\nGet a couple of actors and while they were acting draw their blood to show how the chemistry in their body was authored by the role that they were portrayed as fast they really didn't believe it would do anything\nBut he gets thank God he gave him a mission there's so many ... as they know that it's crazy I Can't say that I'm so he got a male and female and gave them to script one script was\nThe male a character was murder or who had killed the woman's husband and they meet\nAnd the other was a comedy routine that they both played out and he drove the blood while they stood there reading the script\nOf actors and while they were acting draw their blood to show how the chemistry in their body was offered by the role that they were four train and it's a fascinating really didn't believe it would do anything\nBut he ... thank God he gave him permission there's so many preventive is saying now that it's crazy I Can't say that I'm so he got a male and female and gave them to script one script was\nThe male a character was murder or who had killed the woman's husband and they meet and the other was a comedy routine disabled as laid out and he drove abroad while they stood there reading the script\nAnd of course when it was done and they analyzed abroad in the tragedy like the murder scene the blood levels for stress hormone levels went way up\nAnd the\nHormone levels induced immune function went way down you know again you know I always say you can see why Monday morning as a negative effect on people if you don't like what's happening to you if the presses immune function elevate stress hormone level\nThen he gave them the comedy routine\nAnd drew their blood and of course the opposite happened there stress hormone levels went down a little bit cortisone levels\nAnd the immune function popped right up and so again if you laugh and and this this also is a study I think it was done in one of the Scandinavian countries breast cancer patients who were told to laugh for no\nApparent reason mhm just every three hours lab for no reason for several minutes\nWhen they were studied at the end of I don't know actually was probably a few years that this study went on but at the end of the very end of this study there were more survivors from the last two grew than there were from the control group\nThere's a control group who simply told you know if something funny happens fine you can laugh but don't laugh for no reason and\nIt shows the difference in survival between those who left for no reason and those who laughed only if something funny happened so again you say then I Need to bring more numerous things into my life and they always say yeah keep the kid in you alive\nMeant child always finds things to laugh at 'em and and it doesn't have to be anything structure where the clever it's\nJust something that gets you smiling and giggling and and just little things that kids know\nYou know work and are will make them smile and laugh and if it's sort of a silliness but it's a healthy silliness so you feel comfortable being the child in acting\nA little funny and how's the people's smiling you because you're doing those things\nI mean I keep thinking all the crazy simple things that I say you know he he whether it's sign here and I right here on a piece of paper um for what for that that I Love you know you see that sign wet floor it's most no warning\nIt doesn't have to be anything structured woody clever it's just something that gets you smiling\nAnd giggling and and just little things that kids know\nYou know work and a will make them smile and laugh and if it's sort of a silliness but it's a healthy silliness so you feel comfortable being the child than acting\nA little funny and how's that people smiling you because you're doing those things\nI mean I keep thinking all the crazy simple things I say you know he he whether it's signed he earned it right here on a piece of paper um for what for\nThat that I Love you know you see that sign wet for its most no warn you that the floor is wet but it doesn't say floor wet it says wet floor so I always watch the floor\nPeople look at you and I say well I'm just trying to make you happy and I still have the science so I wiped the floor [laughter] oh I Love that one that's and the kids in school love it you know there's always\nPeople mopping up and cleaning up and then they put a sign up ... floor and the all white and I say to the kids don't forget what floor you know what to do is give me that look like oh you're not what are you doing does ...\nBut the kids no I'm kidding and it just their eyes\nLight up and having a good time or someone who's made them smile\nSo it's interesting very good as you're saying we remember more humorous things in life or they stand out more\nI Know I understand is that you know you have various stuff you know at a time\nI was thinking how significant that is right\nYou're a patient in the hospital you like them to know you as a person now there's room for twenty two right you know or cars film with the colon and you're not a person\nYou see a ... there's no you don't put it this way the diagnosis helps the doctor it doesn't help the patient there the key thing is the story you want to be a story for you Dr nurses whether you're in the office\nOr in the hospital so they know you as a person and I think that's why it's so important to behave in that kind of independent\nManner and not be\nA submissive suffer ... that's where the word patient is derived from\nA submissive suffer oh if if you're a submissive suffer you're in big trouble and not kind of survivor yeah right right but if anyone would I follow what's the\nWord I made a um a a responsible participant a resident R. E. S. P. A. and the nice thing become a restaurant\nYou're responsible participant so you participate you take responsibility you not just lying there let people do things to you or that have nothing to do with your desires but\nThey're treating a disease that they're doing mhm and uh\nWithout any understanding of who you are as a human being that's right\nYou want to be identified mhm is that human being and are now the human doing with the human being ... and ah and you can be who you want to be and that they can come to respect you for that mhm\nYeah that's interesting because if they're giving you win\nIn a restaurant are ESPN the missing become a respite\nYou're responsible participant so you participate you take responsibility you not just lying there let people do things to you or that have nothing to do with your desires but they're treating a disease so that they're doing ... and uh\nWithout any understanding of who you are as a human being\nRight you want to be identified mhm is that human being and are\nNot a human doing for a human being mhm and ah and you can be who you belong to be and uh they can come to respect you for that mhm\nYeah that's interesting because if they're giving you a number like we're ten twenty two ... walking in and the assistant in doing the mechanics of it and not even recognizing the human being and not only\nThat they may give you the wrong number ... who is there a lot of people who received the wrong medications and literally die because of it because the hospital makes a mistake\nThey confuse room numbers or or they talk about a diagnosis instead of a patient's name you know they say here this is really the lady with breast cancer well why don't you say the person's\nName right ... yeah you know because if if the nurse walks into the wrong room you might kill somebody given them more meant for the person in the next room so it's always important to make sure everybody identify you and if they want to you know and I mean this I don't care if they call me and NOT gate\nYou know what I mean what am I have my name my actual name 'em\nThen I Know I'll be treated as that person\n[noise] um so I don't care whether they have you know what you call some derogatory title like the nut case I'd rather be the nut case then have somebody make a mistake about me and who I Am and what disease I have and\nHow they're treating me yeah [noise] that's so\nImportant so import mechanical versus human yeah\nAnd there's always a mystery involved ... recently as I said I was in the hospital and I knew I'd be fine that my wife is watching\nOver right why she's born on nine nine mhm\nMarried on seven eleven I get to the hospital what room did they put me in in the emergency room number nine oh how interesting\nGet upstairs he put me in eight one nine ... years and Andrea Hsu nine right they take me to do a procedure\nYou mentioned that he's going to room eleven oh my good is it ... it gets so mystical ... and I always feel like oh my wife is taking care of everything [laughter] you know right in right to put me in the right places that the right thing right\nTake me to do a procedure you mentioned that he's going to ruin eleven on line is it ... it gets so mystical and I always feel like oh my wife is taking care of everything [laughter] you know right and then put me in the right places and the right thing right\nShifts blood just as I said just as it's another emotion they range is your body chemistry so when you fearful there is more blood going the muscles so you can you know fight for your life and run and do things um\nGoing to certain areas of the brain that will help you physically do scape something rather than to think and analyze and you know being in love at that moment isn't going to do much but being afraid of a rabid dog can get\nYou away and save your life\nSo the emotion of it\nPropels one that's right yeah because he ran gentle even lie in other words you I mean we've all read these stories where\nSomebody's car collapses you know on a on a family member and this person lift the car\nAnd you say why you lifted the car and they did\nThey raised it announced a person can get out you know and save their life but you say how do you get that strength well it's motivated by the fear\nThat there's going to be the loss of life of a loved one so what chargers insurgents through your body oh you to do things you would never be able to do if I said you go out to the garage and lift the car so I could change that dire\nYou'd say Modi nuts but if your loved one was lying under their you lift the damn thing and get that person out\n... I don't have a very protective side of ourselves yeah yeah\nSurvival is built into\nRight I mean you know God is thought about these things I always say if you got your finger isn't\nLeading you know those things have built into us so it's important to keep all those mechanisms\nFunctioning so they are there to protect you and they carry you but when you're in a panic when you're in fear it confuses your body ... doesn't know what to do to protect you\nI'm a all those mechanisms are they say confused and doing the wrong things often because they don't know what you're thinking\nOh to increase his blood pressure\nRight\nYeah yeah survival is built into\nRight I mean you know God is thought about these things I always say if you got your finger is not leaving you know\nThings have built into us so it's important to keep all those mechanisms\nFunctioning so they are there to protect you and they carry you but when you're in a panic when you're in fear it confuses your body ... doesn't know what to do to protect you\nUm ... all those mechanisms are they say confused and doing the wrong things often because they don't know what you're thinking\nOh to increase his blood pressure\nRight\nYeah right yeah you're you're more likely to have the artist that Monday morning ... who are disgusted with your job and do my own or work\nOr then when you love what you're doing and look forward to going out in the street and are seeing the world I always tell people to build shrines in their own homes to put a picture themselves up when they were young and cute and when you walk by a picture of yourself\nLoves the kids love yourself and that love\nAnd um it makes a difference because mhm every day day after day you take two minutes and you give yourself a little love but it it gets through believe me\n[noise] because it's it's also very joyful when we're younger\n... really different type of a human being that yeah I think you're right you know we don't have all that baggage stuff some of us have on more than all of this but and it's smiling usually children always smiling\nWell the kids what I've found was if you're honest with them mhm um or at least you thought they thought you would be honest they believe view so\nI always used the way I express things and said things for the kids benefit in other words telling them what was going to be good now what was going to go wrong or be bad or the pain or\nYeah I always focused on the good things mhm so the kids games to expect the good things to happen I rather than the bad yeah mhm mhm\nI mean if something came up as a complication ... I can say I'm Sorry this is unexpected I'm Sorry\nBut you'll do fine\nI'm so they were mad at me if I didn't tell them every detail of everything that happened to them and that would be worse\n... and they don't hold it in\nRight all the kids don't right they they want to get mad at you they'll get mad at you write a love that yeah\nRight right right they get mad and then they forget about it yeah hold on hold on to write and I say well we're going to continue or\nA Bernie I'm thinking about the next the next segment for you\nAnd the listeners uh we've been listening to the doctor Bernie Segal retired surgeon with so many interesting so many interesting stories or you could write books and books and this burning books and books [noise] um [laughter] yeah\nWhen you look at it right you know I'm Still right okay [laughter] well we're going to be right back with Dr Bernie say going no matter the heart\nRight they want to get mad at you they'll get mad at you\nLook back yeah right right right\nRight they get mad and then they forget about it yeah I don't hold on to write I say well we're going to continue a Bernie I'm thinking about the next the next segment for you and the listeners [noise]\nWe've been listening to Dr Bernie Segal retired surgeon with so many interesting so many interesting stories you could write books and books and this burning books and books\n[laughter] I don't when you look at it right you know I'm Still right okay [laughter] well we're going to be right back with Dr Bernie say go no matter eleven hundred I Am\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou trying to get ready for emotional\nWill be listening when nine PM through all of you for help you yourself from past week it opened the window of special and unique like huge story to bring awareness to her look toward the mineral heart every Wednesday nights\nWith Carol with us in just like Bernie you your heart you're listening to the better of the heart every Wednesday night you know I'm an independent taco living\nHundred lifting loves you going to be\nThere are lots of good reason to take a good quality multivitamin even the best eating plants can fall short of meeting all of the necessary nutrients you need each day enrolled laboratories offering different multivitamin formulas which central the men's women's and the needle formulas to meet individual needs\nEach formula contains co enzyme activated forms a beach you meet zipped into like I said I'll be on minerals the gold standard in mineral key light\nVitamin K n n K seven and full spectrum mixed a cough or all took a tree in all ... ...\n... is one of the standout nutrient Denise formula and forty six percent of the U.S population did not process but like asking properly putting them at greater risk for premature a heart attack and drunk depression and even get the ... picking he won the the multivitamin isn't easy way to fill in small nutritional gap\nLearn more about emerald laboratories science states multivitamin formula by going to travel laboratory dot com that ultra laboratory dot com\nThat's our ...\nOur our child we lose an arm\nYou where you are I'm sure if you're on\nIn the world [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nTo be a member of serving proud to serve in\n\n[noise] I have a job where you know you're on\nIn the world\n\n[noise]\n\nMembers serving and I'm proud of the ...\n\nListen to help helps cost Arizona's most popular my mom's talk radio show\nFeaturing functionally integrated medicine right here on TALK after nine eleven hundred am\nSponsored by healthy healthy\nBusiness realty I'm\nListening in every Wednesday afternoon from four to five pm to your financial our hosted by Andy Paladino for trips and ideas on financial in retirement planning your financial our Wednesday's four to five PM right here on independent talk of loving hundred ...

decided to have her DNA tested and then she saw the results and she saw that she was\nAs little as one one thousand Native American which is actually lower than the average person who lives on the north American continent and then\nShe and her staff I assume she consulted with her staff said let's give this to the Boston Globe and let them put it on the front page and that will convince everybody that I Am in fact the Native American I claimed so I could get that sweet job at Harvard a\nL brought a joins me now who's managing editor of the stream\nNow welcome back to the program and\nDo do you think that Elizabeth Warren made a big mistake and is it big enough to take her out of the presidential sweepstakes\nWell compared to Custer that huge mistake but er [noise] it what it did is it definitely lowered or stock I mean if I'm putting money on two thousand two thousand twenty democratic race she just she just got a ... she blew it in a way 'cause she\nIt it's not so much that that is what how she did it it's one thing to take the test I'm Glad you took the test that's cool and I'm Glad she's proud that there's some that blood in there but to to try to use it as a slam dunk against Trump\nWas in it was stupid and she looked silly and when you look silly once that gets into the the cultural divide you're in trouble like Cory Cory bookers Spartacus thing you're in trouble you know you're you're already ... you're going to take down Trump with that kind of thing I mean come on ... the only thing really did\nShe really really did some damage to herself with this and it was self inflicted too and and that she could have done at least the details in a way to put ... you know put away the issue that she didn't do it in prisons are smart enough to do that as part of the president\nThe other thing is now at some level I think she knows that she's not Native American and I think she's ... twenty twelve when it was question and she came up with inadequate a proof of it and I think this would have been an opportunity I could even see\nUh if if you had a staff willing to stand up for themselves and say to the boss and I know it's tough says Abbas boss you're wrong here's what you should do you should go out and said this has been an issue since ...\nYou're in trouble you know you're you're already ... you're going to take down Trump with that kind of thing I mean come on ... the only thing really did\nShe really really did some damage to herself with this and it was self inflicted too and and that she could have done at least the details in a way to put ... you know put away the issue and she didn't do it in prisons are smart enough to do that is it's going to be president\nWell the other thing is is out at some level I think she knows that she's not Native American and I think she's known them since twenty twelve when it was questioned then she came up with an adequate a proof of it and I think this would have been an opportunity I could even see\nUh if if she had a staff willing to stand up for themselves and say to the boss and I know it's tough says Abbas boss you're wrong here's what you should do you should go out and say this has been an issue since ... who was brought up in that election campaign\nAnd I've now during a test and I found out that I'm only at most three percent Native American so you know what I was wrong and if she had done that\nAnd and use that as soon as she still would have been able to say to the public I'm I'm maybe as much as three percent Native American\nBut I was wrong to claim that Native American status I didn't do it for any bad reason I think she did do it for a bad reason to advance or sell financially and professionally but she could do that\nAnd I think America what is it oh okay and then it would have disappeared as an issue\nWell here you go and she had the perfect and she has a perfect um hook is he the ancestry dot com there's ancestry dot com commercial where some guy say for all my life we thought we were German we went to the you know October fest dressed up and then we found that were Seventy percent Irish\nOr whatever I've seen a commercial out there that that deals with this she does a spoof of that commercial or what I mean that's the way out there a little bit but still be I\nWill not do it well no you're on the right track culture you're on the right track out imagine if she'd said hey you know that ancestry commercial is the guy who thought he was Irish and then he founded is these are tallying instead well\nGuess what I found out I'm In the same boat and I think people would have laughed they would have said well OK and we'll let bygones be bygones I've seen politicians do it but so few of the I Want your view on this so few politicians seem capable of saying hey you know what\nI was wrong about that but I Apologize and are no hard feelings right and and then by twenty twenty if anybody like me tried to bring this thing back up again they say hey she dealt with that she said she was wrong why don't you let that wouldn't go\nYeah I heard you're exactly right hurt her tax would have been to like under play under play what ...\nUnder play the relationship and they said ... admits she made the ... and ... she made a mistake and people on it because\nIt again like you said if he made a little bit of light of it and she she wouldn't look foolish there wouldn't be the means out there and that that that are gonna be just as devastating as Dukakis on that tank you know\nOh my God you all boy and the ... when you say that the picture comes back to my but the other thing or two years later Thirty years he's still knows he looks like a feel for and Everytime I go to an email from Howard Dean and I'm Still getting ... emails not personally but you know the solicitations I think about that scream\nOr whatever it was he said that night that in one moment one big scream ended his entire and he was the hot prospect but here's the other thing that bugs me about it now you tell me what you think\nWe hire presidents and senators and governors to make great decisions and we expect them to to be done in a way that serves all of us and sometimes they involve the life and death sending people to war spending huge amounts of money sinking the country into debt or getting us out\nSo when we hire people to make a really great decisions and then we see someone like Elizabeth Warren make\nBoy and the ... when you say that the picture comes back to my but the other thing or two years later Thirty years he's still knows he looks like a fuel for and Everytime I go to an email from Howard Dean and I'm Still getting ... emails not personally but you know the solicitations I think about that scream\nOr whatever it was he said that night that in one moment one big scream ended his entire and he was the hot prospect but here's the other thing that bugs me about it now you tell me what you think\nWe hire presidents and senators and governors to make great decisions and we expect them to to be done in a way that serves all of us and sometimes they involve the life and death sending people to war spending huge amounts of money sinking the country and the debt or getting us out\nSo when we hire people to make a really great decisions and then we see someone like Elizabeth Warren make a colossally bad this she's had six years to think about it she gets the new data and and rather than saying\nYou know I probably have to admit I was just wrong and that this is my excuse to do it she makes a colossally bad mistake\nAnd then says by the way would you like me making mistakes from the most powerful office in the world\nYou know what what's interesting is as you're talking I'm remembering what I guess as chief of staff Kelly said about her a couple of weeks ago how he she was arrogant and of course you took that as well be strong to the president blah blah blah you know\nThis is just you know that's a general generals used to that you know tough people you know it's a color arrogant and say that that's the key to this this thing if the arrogance of thinking well I've got the the media behind me I'm going to do this and I'm going to jump on Trump that's I think some of the key to\nPeter why she thought this would be a good idea and in doing it again it the way she did\nThere's all there's also I think comedy is in her ... you can't give yourself a nickname so if if Cory Booker wanted to beat Spartacus he needed to arrange for somebody else to call them Spartacus when you call yourself Spartacus doesn't quite work as well\nYeah yeah and that's and that's the thing and they're all all these people are trying to all these Democrats who are thinking about two dozen twenty\nAll trying to nudge their way to the front of the pack in her case I think he's trying to be the foil to Trump see I got him I got well you don't like them all when you're up you're losing sixty four to nothing you know one sixty fourth Indian and it's like being down sixty four to nothing spiking the ball you look stupid\nYou know but that study that twenty twenty or so focused on that you're not taking care of business and doing what you need to do to win\nSo tell me this goes back to the presidency now do you think this takes her out of it or does she find a way to stay in it because I mean that would be God's Gift to talk radio I'll admit but not not great for the country or does this clear the path from for Joe Biden would say\nThat it makes things easier for

don't\nReally at all that and then they were talking also about\nUm what they say is taking the fact that I sit there and I said my doctor for it on at the end and better was saying that um that\nDonald Trump himself to clarify that ended up in a minute that he um did it\nOn that ... that Kevin I wouldn't have made it if\nIt had not been for you know but he was sane at the rally that'll

her lap and they will not be what the rally to laugh at Dr Ford does he have enough men and I say I don't know that that they\nEnjoy knee joint\nTake a break and just let me ask you a couple of questions do you agree that the accusation that Dr Ford made was very thinly evidence she couldn't remember most of the details\nThat would be the details necessary to prove something happened and when she named witnesses none of the witnesses including her best friend could remember that it ever even happened in fact her best friend so she never even met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet the doctor for a professor Ford said that her best friend was there when this awful thing was supposed to happen\nThe reason there is so much anger at a Christine Blasey Ford ... Ford is that she made a career and frankly person destroying accusation and did it with nothing but she did it with nothing to back it up\nRight but I\nDon't hold hold on joy joy I've got to push back

with the police Texas is doing it they put into law a requirement that says any student entering the ninth grade this year this academic year or thereafter has to take part in a class and watch a video on how to interact properly with officers during traffic stops\nIt's kind of amazing that we've reached that point in America where parents some parents apparently are doing such a poor job of

at talk journalism and\n... that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com you know I remember it wasn't that many years ago that a president named Obama was telling Americans word peak oil we're going to be running out of oil so we have to get away from oil\nJust as fast as we possibly can and then of course we've seen the energy revolution over about the last decade or so in which America is gone from\nA big importer and heavily dependent on\nForeign sources of oil to not only self sufficient but literally enough energy in oil and natural gas that we can literally export a lot of it and that we have abundant supply and we don't have to be beholden to foreign shakes or Venezuela or\nNasty people like that so what we still have politicians who are trying to push us out from away away from oil\nUm build the bonds you a mayor of New York is calling on cities to give up their investments and the oil industry and I thought I talked to Dan kiss you about that who senior vice president at the policy foreign policy at the Institute for energy research Dan welcome back\nEither Lars\nSo what do you what's your first blush impression of Mayor Bill de Blasio apparently deciding that his mandate as mayor is not just run the biggest city in the country but also to talk all the other cities out of investing a dime in oil\n[noise] yeah well it seems to be a common thread among the politicians who are are vying for higher office um it it it sounds good to circle number of people out there and it\nIt's virtually signaling the what it really is doing is ultimately hanging off\nEnormous law says that they would otherwise not have a in those pension funds and to the tune for example in New York state of a one point two to one point five trillion dollars over fifty years that asked\nSo what do you what's your first blush impression of Mayor Bill de Blasio apparently deciding that his mandate as mayor is not just run the biggest city in the country but also to talk all the other cities out of investing a dime in oil [noise]\nYeah well it seems to be a common thread among politicians who are are vying for higher office um it it it sounds good to a certain number of people out there and that\nIts virtues signaling the one that really is doing is ultimately handing off\nEnormous law says that they would otherwise not have a in those\nPension funds and a ... to the tune for example in New York state of a one point two to one point five trillion dollars over fifty years that has to be made up by somebody ah in order to pay people's pensions\nAnd you know that's going to be ultimately the taxpayers\nWell and and so if I understand correctly he would like all the big cities who have massive pension\nFunds that have to earn money until the people who are going to get the pensions get paid and that when if they were to back out of oil stocks I assume they'd put the money into some other kind of dogs and the oil stocks would be sold to willing buyers who would happily buy them so it won't make any difference to the oil companies will still have plenty of people who can buy them\nBut New York will have given given up on the returns they would have had from the ... you know ... the business of fossil fuels which is still a business that are very much supplies the energy for America so what's what's his thinking I mean do you have any idea what why he wants to do this\nWell it's all part of trying to show that\nYou're virtuous and care about climate change Lars this is all about climate change a as all energy issues tend to be now um and what they're what they're trying to say is that by taking the money out of a those\nReturns are those cells\nThey'll simply be taking money away from these companies and they won't have the money and therefore they want drill wells or something um you know that to be nonsense because the fact of the matter is when you compare portfolios with energy stocks of all kinds in them versus ones without a the energy\nOr sons perform better\nAnd have perform better of over fifty years so [noise]\n... basically what you're [laughter] you're cutting off your nose to spite their face ill in some respects\nI mean aren't because the only way for a city to pull money out we talk about it like it's pulling out a drawer but the only way to pull out of a stock is to sell it to somebody else so you'll have willing buyers who will buy those stocks\nWill when the willing buyers by them the oil company as an out anything they still have investors who own their stocks in fact I guess they if the city of New York wants to have a\nFire sale and sell their their all their socks and if they announced they're going to do this I assume some of the buyers are going to say great they're going to give us a sweet deal\nThey'll end up they may have the I guess they could even take stock they bought for a given an amount of money and end up selling it to people for less money than they paid for it that's potentially possible but the ... the stock will still be owned by somebody\nBut as you say their stock portfolio they can't replace that stock with the stock that performs as well as the oil stock does so they'll have to take a loss or their pension fund recipients the police officers and the\nOther civil service workers of New York are they aware of what the city is about to do to them\nWell luckily they have someone in in New York state or the controller who who is in charge of the Senate\nWho own their stocks in fact I guess they if the city of New York wants to have a fire\nSale and sell their their all their socks and did they announce they're going to do this I assume some of the buyers are going to say great they're going to give us a sweet deal\nThey'll end up they may have the I guess they could even take stock they bought for a given an amount of money and ended up selling it to people for less money than they paid for

stock does so they'll have to take a loss or their pension fund recipients the police officers and the\nOther civil service workers in New York are they aware of what the city is about to do to them\nWell luckily they have someone in in New York state or the controller who who is in charge of a sudden he has something called a fiduciary responsibility which uh\nAnyone who manages money tends to have and you're supposed to watch out for those interests to make sure that you don't make bad investments that take away from the value of those people who own shares in it and those were the firemen and policemen and civil servants of all time and um\nAnd he's objecting strenuously to this for the very reasons you and I are discussing because he knows the\nThe record and can show that and can show in a norm is lost to the city under the state because it's it's not just a mayor de Blasio also Governor Cuomo ...\nCan they even legally divest themselves of the stocks of the controller says no this would cause a loss can heat prevent them from doing\nIt varies from state to state and it gets a little dicey because you're dealing with these public funds which don't have a say in some of the same requirements are obviously because so many of them are underfunded Lars I mean we hear all the time about the states that have massive\nPension obligations that can't afford them Illinois and New York California um and\nAnd so there's a little more leeway in that situation but the for the person in charge are they still attempt to live up to the fiduciary responsibility so uh it's not as ironclad as if you were dealing with a a U.S chartered bank or something like that\nAnd well it would be interesting to see what they do because I I I just I I think it's highly irresponsible for them to do this and the other thing is New York city itself can't run without fossil fuels candidate they can't run on diesel gasoline and natural gas\nOr no it would have a very very hard time and the north east is getting increasingly\nIn bad shape as a consequence of bad decisions that won't allow pipelines rebuilt and that sort of thing so we'll see what the winter holds but ah last winter they barely escaped death and uh it's it's probably gotten worse ah and if we get a cold winter will\nWill be able to see ... laboratories of democracy Lars\nKnow it'd be interesting I I Know it's it's just fantasy but can you imagine if the big oil companies are said to New York city you want to do that fine you wanna get out of fossil fuels find we will stop delivery\nOf fossil fuels to all your filling stations you know we won't cut off\nThe you know the oil heat that some people still depend on but we are going to stop supplying gasoline and will do it for a week to see how you like being without gasoline and be entirely out of oil can you imagine I mean as much as Manhattan runs on mass transit they also run on Hoover and cabs and diesel powered buses and the like\nCan you amend jets and yachts can you imagine where they'd be if\nFossil fuel a liquid fuel deliveries stop\nUh it's it's probably gotten worse ah and if we get a cold winter will will be able to see ... laboratories of democracy Lars\nYou know it'd be interesting uh I I Know it's it's just fantasy but can you imagine if the big oil companies are said to New York city you want to do that fine you want to get out of foster feels fine we will stop delivery\nOf fossil fuels to all your filling stations you know we won't cut off\nThe you know the oil heat that some people still depend on what we're going to stop supplying gasoline and will do it for a week to see how you like being without gasoline and be entirely out of oil can you imagine\nI mean as much as Manhattan runs on mass transit they also run on over and cabs and diesel powered buses and the like can you imagine ingest can you imagine where they'd be\nFossil fuel a liquid fuel deliveries stopped to say filling stations and the and the local airport\n[noise] ah that would be one of those what did President Obama is to always tell us that it's a a ...\nCouple foreman or [laughter] something like that teachable moment teachable moment and just say you want to try it well I'll tell you what will just slow it\nDown and we'll cut our deliveries to half\n[laughter] if you work on a farm you know very early in life and that that we need to get young people look let me give you another example\nWe've got something like twenty million people in college today right like they'd be working while they're in school they get Twenty one twenty two year work when I was actually probably wouldn't have a well you know that that student debt crisis if these kids work while they were in school to pay for their education that was that so unreasonable\nNo and especially Steve I remembered nominally I work all the way through the year and a half or is the school that I did and then I took part time class after that but I knew people who in the summertime said they'd go and do the hard dirty jobs in the summertime and they'd rack up three or four thousand dollars\nIn the summertime because they live at home with mom and dad works some dirty job make a bunch of money put it in the bank and they'd have half their half their tuition paid by the time they got back to school and they didn't have to borrow it\nAnd by the way it allows those kinds of people 'cause I remember when I was in college my junior year I live with four guys in the house to model and financial aid and the other two were working\nWhich to do you think got a better uh you know get more out of their education you know ... and Steve I Can't say I actually had to work so they actually knew the value of the education if you get something way to people for free they're not going to value it right I mean so I think that would be an area we can get a lot more workers we need to get the skills\nTook part time class after that but\nI knew people who in the summertime said they'd go and do the hard dirty jobs in the summertime and they'd rack up three or four thousand dollars\nIn the summertime because they live at home with mom and dad works some dirty job make a bunch of money put it in the bank and they'd have half their half their tuition paid by the time they got back to school and they didn't have to borrow it\nAnd by the way ... those kinda people 'cause I remember when I was in college my junior year I live with four guys in the house to model and financial aid and the other two were working which to do you think got a better uh you know get more out of their education\nYou know ... and Steve\nI Can't say I actually had to work so they actually knew the value of the education if you give something way to people for free they're not going to value it right I mean so I think that would be an area we can get a lot more workers we need to get the skills for the workers but you know what the employers will give these workers the skills\nThey will train them out of the job they will train them how to use a forklift or how to drive a truck or a you know be a welder or you know all these just by the way it ... you know what's truck drivers are earning twenty thousand dollars oh\nLet me tell you I ran into a couple of guys who'd come to a station event the listener event and I was younger guy and they just were\nFriends and I said uh what do you do to the older guy and he said I run an electrical contracting business I said you know I tried to talk my step son into that\nI said I I Know there were both union and non union training programs where they would hire you and the rate two years ago was fourteen fifty an hour so it's like twenty nine thousand a year and every six months if you stayed in a program where you went to a class\nFour hours a night for one night a week so it wasn't you know it wasn't asking you to go sixteen hours a day all week long\nThat at the end the tuition for was eighty bucks a month and it was an official state approved process where you at the end of four years you had eight thousand on the job training hours working at others and then and then you had six or seven hundred hours\nIn a classroom and every if you stayed in the program you started a fourteen fifty every six months your paycheck went up by a buck fifty\nAn hour three thousand bucks a year now and then by the time you've finished you were thirty five dollars an hour Seventy grand a year that you could salary while I said to this guy said so that's where you're hired your journey man he says Mars we can't get journeyman for\nThirty five bucks an hour he said we're paying forty two dollars an hour yeah Steve that's Ninety thousand dollars a year to start as a journeyman electrician\nAnd you know what this is a shame of that story is meanwhile we spent two hundred thousand dollars and you know at cost to the taxpayer to put these kids through college and half of them are walking out with a sociology degree or ethnic studies degree or political\nScience degree I guess what they're not jobs for political science degree or a sociology degree you've got to be able to do something you know and this was a failure\nEducation system virus we're not preparing\nYou know these kids the twenty first century for the twenty first century cats when I was in high school I don't know if you had this we had shop class so we do a number that we did have had any market hey you know what they have their touchy feely classes now\n[laughter] it's just it's the education system is not a parent we spent\nTwo trillion dollars a year on our education system\nHours but we're not preparing the kids for the job so they can compete with the Chinese and the Indians and Europeans and it's one of the biggest failings of this country we've\nGot a ... you know we've got to turn that around because there are there are probably ten million Americans of working age that could be working and should be working but um even people with disabilities and it just because your dad back or something like that doesn't mean you can't work on the assembly line but she could be it over a driver or\nYou know work as a clerk I mean we need we need all hands\nNot preparing you know these kids the twenty first century for the twenty first century jobs when I was in high school I don't know if you have this we had shop class so we did we did the market you know what they have their touchy feely classes now\nIt's just it's the education system is not a parent we spend\n... billion dollars a year our education system\nHours but we're not preparing the kids for the job so they can compete with the Chinese and the Indians and Europeans and it's one of the biggest failings of this country we've\nGot to ... you know we've got to turn that around because there are there are probably ten million Americans of working age that could be working and should be working but um even people with disabilities and it just because your dad back or something like that doesn't mean you can't work on the assembly line but you could be at overdrive oh well\nYou know work as a clerk I mean ever we need we need all hands on deck right now and then they'd everybody working I've got I've got a suggestion\nSteve and that is than in all these communities that got rid of the shop class and maybe even got rid of all the physical facilities\nWhat would happen if they went to some of the industries in their area and said hey we want to teach kids how to do shop but we need we need to ... we'll give you the space in one of our buildings but what we need is we need some ... some planners and some ... and all this stuff for my shop classes\nAnd and we're going to teach these kids how

who was a previous Facebook employee who were just left the company and at first I thought this was a good thing he he denounced\nOr their censorship of everything but then proceeded to explain that it's um\nIt's not coming from the top of Facebook bosses but it's like dissemination I'm from Rhode lackeys I guess within Facebook as though they're able to get around what ... ...\nUm and maybe that's true but to me it sounded more like a deflection of responsibility and even just another example where the lack of creativity from the left\nSo I didn't see the report but that's actually true we knew that the big jak guys want to censor but that the leftist they've hired remember like six months ago when I got banned off you do for a while and then they said oh he was put back thousands concerns were banned it was ... groups that didn't understand that were poorly trained no they hired\nTwenty thousand Southern Poverty Law Center trade ashtray dabba ...\nAnd just ship them in there and a government contract that Obama set up two years ago which still operating with billions of dollars and so yes it's partially ruined Bob and below and then the executives deny they know what's going on but but but really they knew what they were doing what you see the plausible deniability\nWhat like a bird on 'em and maybe that's true but\nTo me it sounded more like a deflection of

but still operating with billions of dollars and so yes it's pressure on Bob and below and then the executives denied I Know it's going on but but but really they knew what they were doing but you see the plausible deniability but I just brought in the army of sensors\nYes and and all that to say that you know you're banned from these platforms um and so it's a war and and you know I feel like you need to use your platform and where and your influence right now to start denouncing these companies\nUm you know every year everybody that's listening to you have the planet in their in them that they need to like separate from the east\nLike through the shirt we're going to try to build a more high tech you know basic message board and posting system for everybody very very soon we're going to try to do it all I'm just not one of these big billion dollar companies but but I mean I'm saying they should be rude anti trusted\nI've written reports in that law firm ... reports the president starting six months ago that's why I was shut down I've been behind the scenes and on air you may have just tuned in for the first time that we've been leading the charge against us with Matt

Congressman Joe Walsh back with you this Wednesday follow\nMe on Twitter at Walsh freedom were twenty days away again twenty days away from\nA really important mid term election I wanted to get kind of a view on what's going on out there especially with some of these Senate races happy to be joined by Alexandra dissing this she's with a National Review 'em\nA publication that everybody should check out every day Alexandria thank you for joining me uh let me start broad work twenty days out right now I'm it appears that when it comes to the United States Senate there's momentum for Republicans yeah\nI think that's exactly right read on where we are and that was always the case I mean looking at the map here it was always favorable at the Republican given are so many democratic incumbents ... that Donald Trump won and twenty sixteen but I think you know even the momentum now as clearly as favoring Republicans perhaps even more overtime\nI'm intrigued Alexandra by a ... a couple of races I saw a debate a couple of nights ago in Arizona a mix Sally against cinema um gimme gimme your thoughts on this race it appears to still be neck in neck\nI think so I and we haven't ... if it's probably died in there hasn't been a new poll in the last couple of days but I'm awaiting very early a three foot tall and that rate over the last couple of days in particular it's really interesting stories that come out about access cinematic Democrat\nIn the race and she apparently has passed or being intensely oppose the Iraq War protesting our troops out you know ... very strange kind of even attacking her state thing that people in our town they're crazy and I I really can't imagine that comments like that are are going to have at least some kind of negative effect on her campaign\nAre you surprised a that cinema is doing as well as she's doing in Arizona and and the only reason I ask is I Know Martha mix Sally and she's a strong military she's got a really strong record\nI guess I'm surprised at that race is close\nYou know I I started was as well but you have to think about you know the facts\nCouple of days but I'm awaiting very early uh the most recent poll in that race to get over the last couple of days in particular some really interesting stories have come out about ... and cinnamon who's the Democrat\nIn the race um and she's you know apparently has passed or being intensely opposed the Iraq War protesting our troops out you know down the list of just very strange kind of even attacking her own state thing that people in Arizona are crazy and I I really can't imagine that comments like that are aren't going to have at least some kind of negative effect on her campaign\nAre you surprised a that cinema he's doing as well as she's doing in Arizona and and the only reason I ask 'cause I Know Martha ... she's a strong military just got really strong record\nI I guess I'm surprised that race is close\nYou know I I started was as well but you have to think about you know the fact that Jeff Flake is a current incumbent and is retiring at least in part a presumably because a certain ... certain type of Republicanism resonating an estate anymore for some reason I think a big part of that it's\nChanging demographics that you know on the state was pretty close and twenty sixteen is not your standard a Republican voter there and so I think I'm\nPerhaps than him I was able to sort of capture the messaging with more of a an Arizona style and you come across as left progressive than she actually is an appeal to people\nNow we're a last question Arizona I Know that Trump is coming in I think before the weeks out how does Trump play in a state like that\nI think that's actually a tough question I'm a I'm a little bit surprised to

nineteenth avenue gamble back uh born in St Joe says I'm bilingual speaking Spanish or ... that doesn't make me necessarily a good doctor what makes me to the doctor is going back to purpose actually trying to help people\nYou put them in a retainer\nFor about twelve to Eighteen months after that correct he said yes I did is the reason that you do that\nIs to put the memory and trying to make it permanent for the correction of the team so they don't go back into the brain he said yes\nI said thank you I'm now going to be helping more people permanently and that is the law of the body it's not Dr frost opinion it's a neurological law was what you are governed and I want you to remember something when they put a retainer in what's the root word retain\nAnd they do that on purpose it's an intentional act to get you a better longer correction and that's what we do in our clinic that's what we've done with Travis and you've heard Travis\nTravis didn't tell you whether I was trying to get out of him but he didn't tell you what's the other day when we were talking to the other guys were asking what's up with you how come you're not taking your medication why don't you hurting and of course he was telling his story to them and that's what I Want you also remember you don't have to hurt this guy is challenging in his body to me like an M M A fighter\nYou know he's pounding it out there and he's carrying you know thirty forty fifty pounds of you know in a backpack in an armored\nSo please you know you don't have to be that guy like ... you can just be that person who wants to walk better play golf you want to play tennis he told you is coming back to do his shoulder why would somebody travel all the way from tendencies to come see me when he could go to anybody\nIt's a relationship gets trust and as result why because I told you the definition of purpose and my purpose was to help him the best that I could and I'm very thankful that God was able to help them heal his body with the natural way of using embryonic tissues cells to rebuild him while bio mechanically correcting has problem I'm\nTo hurting and of course he was telling his story to them and that's what I Want you also remember you don't have to hurt this guy is challenging in his body to me like an M M A fighter you know he's pounding it out there and he's carrying you know thirty forty fifty pounds of you know in a backpack in an armored\nSo please you know you don't have to be that guy like drivers you can just be that person who wants to walk better play golf you want to play tennis he

I told you the definition of purpose mhm and my purpose was to help him the best that I could and I'm very thankful that God was able to help him he'll his body\nWith the natural way of using embryonic tissues cells to rebuild him while bio mechanically correcting has problem I'm so thankful and passion to be a part of that world and help people like Travis our military get back out there helping us and then join his life\n[noise] and I took a nasty it's I actually had a few people coming in the story this week with addicts pain [laughter] yeah it's a very calm and so so what what would you say to them like what would you take take me through that process as of like how you can help them\nWell first of all I Would passionately say that it's so awful yes because I have suffered from that yes All right um so\nThat it comes from the nerve roots in the low back region and it's an comes from about five different routes five different vertebrate where the vertebrate excuse me the ... the rules are all come together\nAnd they create one big nerve and they call it the ... addict nerves now any one of those nerves on either side of the spine at any level and have nerve interference on it and cause this phenomenon called ridiculous apathy\nNobody knows why it happens it just does it can even get a part of your leg and go down into your toes and you're like why does it my whole leg or how come my little toes are going down but not my big one well that's the L for nerve route they'll five is the big toe and then we can get into the other anatomy butts\nRegenerative medicine and what I Do think it's absolutely amazing when we when we take what I've done for so many years and now in the last two years we've had regenerative medicine to help to repair the ... and the cartilage of the joints that are supposed to be gliding smoothly\nAnd and function in the way they are designed versus kind of reading against each other and can rebuild and regenerate re lubricate that area for nice lose colliding motion and what I noticed with people who have\nA I had a gun is if we just stem cells and it's only about thirty percent effective but one in ... when they come in and they go through and Levi only chemical you start changing the body\nAnd we start re hydrate in that just naturally which they're special equipment that I used as Patton did they do this I don't own it I've another gentleman Dr Pettit bond designed it but I've been using it for ten years and we've been getting people better for the last eight years with this stuff but when we put\nThe regenerative medicine in there that blows my mind how quickly they get better MCI joins like Travis I only adjusted in twice\nWow and I can tell you that most of the time when I'm working with downside joints than we do I am the Arctic issue in regenerative medicine in the joints and we do the ...\nUm and we get 'em you know back to basically normal in about six weeks\nThat normally about you know a week or two into it I don't even have to adjust the U.S I joined anymore hardly at all it just naturally starts moving properly and freely and what happens when we start using this process the data from the lower back actually can start to diminish as well but only with bio mechanical correction now\nPat upon designed it but I've been using it for ten years and we've been getting people better for the last eight years with this stuff but when we put the regenerative medicine in there it blows my mind how quickly they get better MCI joins like Travis I only adjusted in twice\nWow and I can tell you that most of the time when I'm working with downside joins than we do I am the Arctic issue in regenerative medicine in the joints and we do the ...\nUm and we get them you know back to basically normal and about six weeks\nThat normally about a week or two into it I don't even have to adjust the U.S I joined anymore hardly at all it just naturally starts moving properly and freely and what happens when we start using this process\nThe data from the lower back actually can start to diminished as well but only with bio mechanical correction now ... you have such\nAn open ended loaded question I can go on and on and on I I I Love talking about this stuff you could have picked anything\nUm and uh the\nMost important thing I Want people to understand is\nThat I have not found that themselves alone will get rid of ... hardly at all maybe thirty percent like I said it's actually taken decompression and ... on a table special table for water and nutrients and\nAnd the special wobble chair that re hydrate sit there and adjusting that we actually started getting the correction we're slowly over time that ... starts to diminish and it starts to get functioning better so that you can get through your day hopefully without paying\n... we just had a call from one of our listeners and another tough question here for A L she's talking about me oh you got a lot of knee pain but they are how things go so it's not and\nI always there so we ... you know I Know you have to see here and all of that which I Want to remind everybody you've got another seminar coming up you know It's Tuesday I've\nHad a thirty yeah so oh and and there's this young lady wants to come in a U.S has got to do is called that there are two nine nine to ... to six five six six zero to nine nine to\nTwo to five six she can actually get a complementary visit with me where I ate all do a consultation find out what their goals are doing exam on that area and at least let her know if I can help or not if I Can't we'll find somebody who can but it's an interest to have a great story of sole reason if you look down at my left me I have this thing on\nHere yes fly on I've done that let's say you can jump I don't think yeah\nI Know who I'm looking forward to it's going to have\nTo be modeled um [laughter] so you know this is a really good question and because it comes and goes to remember when you're sixty percent dysfunction of a nerve that's when you're going to get the Simpson when it goes below that you're not going to get the symptoms but it doesn't mean the problem is not there are some of the day on my story I was looking forward to today\nAnd I know we don't have much time for six years ago I was in Tennessee and I was mountain\nI was not and biking by myself and it's a ten mile ride and if the remote areas so what I ended up doing was\nCrashing like three to four miles in\nAnd I thought I broke my leg and I didn't and I looked at and like oh it's just a humorous Houma yeah I Know that's the fancy word for like a blood bluster right but it was really big on the inside of my leg just above my knee and my muscular trip but my ... my my leg good function it didn't hurt it just it was kind of like an abrasion\nAnd I thought well what do I do go back or move forward well of course I rode the six to eight miles out in the set by the time I\nWas done I was black and blue all the way from the top of my leg down to a bottom of my calf I'm like I was really dumb and yet doctors do dumb things and so anyway for the last six years I just noticed that you know I have this sort of thing here and I had some lumps in there and I tried to get it out with some ultrasound do conservative things\nThe remote areas so what I ended up doing was crashing like three to four miles in\nAnd I thought I broke my leg and I didn't and I looked at and like oh it's just a huge Houma yeah I Know the the fancy word for like a blood bluster right but it was really big on the inside of my leg just above my knee and my muscular but my ... my my leg good function it didn't hurt it just it was kind of like an abrasion\nAnd I thought well what do I do go back or move forward well of course I rode the six to eight miles out in the set by the time I was done I was black and blue all the way from the top of my leg down to a bottom of my child I was really dumb and yup doctors do dumb things [laughter] so\nAnyway for the last six years I just noticed that you know I had this sort of in here and I have some lumps in there and I tried to get it out with some ultrasound do conservative things and I never really bothered me about two months ago my knee started bothering me I've never injured my knees and in my life I've been into martial arts and wrestling and running and everything\nAbout two weeks ago I could hardly step up on a step on so I came in at when it came and went and I noticed it you know here and there and I was like the typical person like maybe this young lady here and I\nWell I can get through life it's OK I'll just continue the strengths and I go to the gym you ignore it no I don't either knowledge that I disagree with you on that one but I knowledge did but I didn't go to somebody\nThat I should have and have proper extra so I had an MRI done last Thursday okay found out I had three torn muscles on the inside of my leg hopefully on the inside when it's because we're starting to fray Mm I think that was because for six years my muscular Cher was out of balance and started wearing on my next guests mhm so I'm not going to make you gifts or what I did and the next hour\nBut [laughter] I called surge addicts up and I said I Need to see these ... and that afternoon Dr Miller actually be happened to be in the clinic doing injections with themselves and I had an injected then I put this knee brace on an oh my gosh to unload the inside of the knee\nTo unload the inside of the ... with the proper biomechanics and getting things taken care of correctly makes all the difference in the world so I Am a recipient for those that have knee problems\nPlays color called six zero to nine nine to two six five six come shake my hand in my clinic let me see what I can do to help you and let's get you fix stopped suffering yeah get your life back it's not necessary\nAnd I want to remind everybody again for the free workshop that Dr phil Ross has coming up October twenty third next Tuesday at six thirty it's a again a free event you just come in and asked\nThe doctor some great question and that is that one six six zero north fortieth street a sweet cheap too and I was that your clinic so it wasn't that far away you\nKnow are we in my clinic how much how fast and then the next time that you're like in thirty seconds to say and also go to a zero Janet region med dot com saves the region\nNext year in thirty seconds and also do the easy Rachel we can come said\nMimicking disrupt our natural hormone production and so that's why we see with a lot of women especially in my clinical practice we see a lot of younger women with menstrual problems are much lower regularity youth\nUm or really really bad um hormonal acne or migraines so a lot of hormonal I'm imbalances that are happening and what the Astros and does is it helps the body manage a lot of these um hormones disruptor that were\nBeing exposed to 'em and it helps your body protests them a lot better\nTo help bring your hormones back into balance\nAnd um I I think that you know it's definitely an important thing to be doing\nFor um for women of all ages and I think if we can what I'm trying to do my practice is trying to educate the younger women especially you know when I see younger women coming in and they you know they have their hair died every six weeks and they get you know they're ...\nNails done then you know eyelash extensions are really big right now I'm so if you think about how many chemicals just in that you know women are exposing themselves on top of\nYou know makeup and body lotion and you know shampoos and ... and all those chemicals that works posing ourselves to so a lot of it is education on avoidance\nYou know and going to their local health food stores and trying to buy 'em you know natural I deodorant or natural makeup and there's some really really amazing lives that are out there now\nThere are um yeah I Know I have a lot of people that come in and some people do what is this estrogen dominance thing you know yeah you're talking a lot of us out here so [noise] yeah yeah and he's been with him so\nHe had even with hormone testing like I Do a lot of hormone testing in my practice and I often see\nThat estrogen dominance picture like too much estrogen versus projects drone um and so as I mentioned it can lead to a lot of those\nYou know most common women's health conditions that you know you're probably seeing in your store you know women that are coming in and they're like Harris thinning or they have like really really bad PMS or they you know have headaches every month and so they won't hormones are out of balance\nUm but they're not quite sure what to do about it [noise]\nMhm so which products would you recommend for a sin somebody in their mid fifties who um are kind of going through a mental pause but yet still have their cycle every month\nAnd yeah and he's been\nWith him so he had even with hormone testing like I Do a lot of hormone testing in my practice and I often see\nThat estrogen dominance picture like too much estrogen versus protest around um and so as I mentioned it can lead to a lot of those\nYou know most common women's health conditions that you know you're probably seeing in your store you know women that are coming in and they're like hairs thinning or they have like really really bad PMS or they you know have headaches every month and so they won't hormones are out of balance\nUm but they're not quite sure what to do about it [noise]\nMhm so which products would you recommend for a say somebody in their mid fifties who um are tired of going through a mental pause but yet still have their cycle every month which products because you know right now there\nAre again it's so it's a dream it'll be a it's a can't sleep they're moody um they don't know what's going on with their bodies right now so what would you recommend a which products or would you recommend\nYeah so that's that's a really um that's a tough days because a lot of times those women\nAnd also I have to be mindful of you know I don't want to I don't want to recommend you know for patients due to leave and say okay here I'm going to get you know like Fifteen pill that you need manager Perry ... and so\nOn one first and foremost I I always recommend the astro sense because I think that will really help to bring that as a protest drawback to balance and I think his theory\nIs is women always think oh I'm going very menopause\nAll my hormones must be like plummeting but that's not always the case a lot of women that are in that area matter puzzle face off in our estrogen dominant because their protest on levels have been declining\n... for a long time prior to protest wrong usually start declining when we're in our thirties and then you already started getting that estrogen dominance back then and then when we hit ... it's much more dramatic usually when women hitting ... usually that's in their fifth\nLike late forties or fifties that's when estrogen eventually dropped off but that there's that whole preliminary start where there's actually that asked you to nominate is happening so I usually will recommend the Astros then and then um we haven't talked to lie about their journals yet but I\nThink a supporting Israel function is absolutely important to you in that prevent appalled will face to help prepare the body for 'em and applies\nThe adrenal have a huge contributing factor to helping the hormones stay healthy um especially that balance between estrogen and protests around help with sleep help with energy\nHelp with um the will help your serotonin production and help with cravings so that adrenal I'm a a adrenal support is really important as well\nAs a doctor um how do you identify adrenal fatigue\n[noise] yeah so there's a couple of different ways you can you can do 'em do that one was in the ... the advantage to that I had worked in a clinical practice is that you know I'm spending an hour to an hour and a half with some of the ... and doing was held in ...\nBut I Know I'm working I'm In my health food stores have have you only get a small I'm a small amount of time to chit chat with with your customers and so usually I I'm I look at like obvious signs and symptoms of adrenal fatigue um and one thing that and I'm pretty sure you probably have\nOne or two of my books but you know there's the adrenal stress connection books that I co op\nA a adrenal support is really important as well\nAs a doctor um how do you identify adrenal fatigue\n[noise] yeah so there's a couple of different ways you can you can do 'em do that one was in the ... the advantage of that I had worked in a clinical practice is that you know I'm spending an hour to an hour and a half with some of the ... and doing held in because of her\nBut I Know I'm working I'm In my health food store ... ... you only get a small I'm a small amount of time to chit chat with with your customers and so usually I I'm I look at like obvious signs and symptoms of adrenal fatigue um and one thing that I'm pretty sure you probably have\nOne or two of my books but you know there's the adrenal stress connection books that I co authored with Dr Karen Jensen a few years back and then I have my making sense a women's health book which is the purple book\nAnd so in those books there's actually a little questionnaires on\nYou know rate your adrenal Strasser adrenal fatigue and I find that those are great um [noise]\nUh resources for your customers and I always find that it's a great resource for my patients as well and I often you know\nSend them home with the questionnaire and I'll say you know fill this out bring it back on the very next deployment so that's probably the easiest way you know there are other fertile has that you can have done there's cortisol testing that you can have done through saliva testing um that's specifically\nLabs\nI'm so that when I got another test there and testing that you can have done to you but I think probably the easiest way for us to merge and people coming into the whole I Would be kind of look and watch the ... and ... and looking at the um the questionnaire\nGreat in and where can they find this questionnaire is it only in your book or can we find it on your Web site\nThat's a good question I just really did my whole website so I don't know if it's still on there\nUm but I'll make a note to my Web designer that we should do a little blurb about having the questionnaire on there again um but the books for sure and um yeah so I'll I'll add that to on my list of things to do that to my website\nAs well [laughter] that's another thing women like to do is that this to do [laughter] yeah\nI can look under and longer so I'm I wanted to talk a little bit too um\n... which is you're right you know here on the floor it healthy habit we just have like five minutes to just assess really quick of what's going on you know and if it is hormones or if it is a sigh Roy 'cause I Know right now\nEverybody's on high road medication and everybody's complaining to their doctors about you know hair falling now lack of sleep just what's going on and I'm just seen over and over you know what do you have for ... and I have to ask them you know\nThe question again and to make sure that really side right but as you were saying to with the hormones I mean it's cortisol it's adrenal it's your thyroid if one is off its pulling from the other to correct what would you recommend\nThat you know absolutely nothing wrong connection between low adrenal chronic stress affecting how the fire is going to her\nPerform at home mom with normal\nPace if somebody's coming in already ... with a preexisting low thyroid so that that medication for you know ten plus years\n... and there aren't taking any adrenal support that one of the first ... ... you know the woman says okay nine times out of ten there is a call goes oh no I'm picture that I'm lying\nCy rights but as you were saying to with the hormones I mean it's cortisol it's adrenal it's your side writes this one is off its pulling from the other to correct what would you recommend that you\nKnow absolutely nothing wrong connection between lower adrenal chronic stress affecting how the fire is going to perform\nPerform and so the ... case\nIf somebody is coming in already ... with a preexisting low thyroid so they've been on medication for you know ten plus years\nI'm ... and they're not taking any adrenal support that's one of the first inning are all you know the woman says okay nine times out of ten there is a code was all snow um picture that I'm lying for finals this one from\nA town of my customers students that triangle right is that what you're yeah they yeah OK yeah absolutely\nAnd civil that would be um I don't know if we mentioned adrenal sense but that would be you know looking at the adrenal sense formula that you know it's been sort of a ... day adrenal formula in my practice for years and then\nIf they're like um [noise] the the follow up a little bit of extra help because sometimes you can you can provide support and the thyroid will just fall back on its owner will just start functioning a lot better\nSometimes people being a little a little extra thyroid support as well especially if they say hey you know what I've been taking Israel or for years and my I still feel like my ... a little bit off\nThen um you have the final sense formula\nWhich is essentially provides the body with all of the co factors I'm forest fibroid hormone production so we've got you know I ... and ... which is a really nice out of ...

I don't know if we can do anything with that\nOh hey are you back\nYou're saying welcome Dan and Dan's on here\nJust go because if you don't any weight weight then you're going to be story if you're paying a quarter percent higher or if you have to be a discount point meaning let's say if you wanted to get\nToday's rate and the rate had gone up a quarter an eight in the you're on a two hundred and eighty thousand if a ... a point would be an additional uh two thousand seven hundred and forty two dollars that maybe if you like when you wouldn't have to pay\nRight you're talking about towards towards costs to get along at all on the other on the other side of that this was kind of talking about in the open we're seeing a little more softness in general in the market\nMight be a chance to hopefully negotiate from closing costs credit with the seller maybe a little bit of a discount on price it's more of a fifty fifty market\nSo you have that on the other side\nI Do I'm seeing more and more Delhi's agreed to pay costs and more and more lifting agents preparing the salaries that you're probably going to have to pay some cause if you want to sell your property because unless you've got a real hot property aggressively price may be a different story\nSure and you find that out in the first couple of weeks you lift your property first week\nYou'll see you'll see right off the bat what the what the activity level is and you're like whoa I enterprise it than overpriced it you know a lot of times when people get the pricing of the properties and they get five offers to thinking oh my God I under price of my house not necessarily\nOur own little stable listings we've we've certainly seen some reductions and it's it's generating activity so it's just a symptom of the ebb and flow of markers\nWhat would you think about the psyche of the buyer right now then would you would you say that the buyer is more apt to want to rush in in lock in by property or would you say that\nUh they're sitting on the sidelines waiting um is it knocking a lot of people out of a of properties that they were thinking about wanting to buy and now they have to find a little bit less expensive property and they're not finding anything appealing what is your what is your take\nI'm planning that people are getting out there trying to secure property because they're afraid rates are going to grow up because the feds they're saying they're going to raise them again so [noise]\nYes and make sure that if you are pre qualified somewhere that you check with your loan officer and find out where rates are because that can definitely a deter like if you wanted to go to Rudy\nAnd the rates than a quarter or three eight or a half and she got pre qualified you may want to bring your your thought process down to two sixty because you know what somebody can qualify doesn't necessarily mean that what they want to pay on a monthly basis\nExactly and not only that but if you think about it prices are going to kind of prices in real estate are going to come down a lot slower than rates will go up so if you're looking at two eighty and now you've got to go to to sixty you're not going to be happy probably as to what's up for two sixty and until prices start to come down\nA that's a great point and or the other thing is um what about people that are in New bill situations like right now they they they got into their new build safe three months ago\nAnd the property is getting its got three more months to go and uh they got qualified the very beginning on a rate that was going to be at say five percent or foreign three A's or foreign Seventy four and a half four and a half now why\nDid you did a ... because I Would imagine some of them are real close to qualifying knock qualifying or ... and you know not to mention builders cut builders contracts or non refundable\nSo if you can't qualify at the end because the rates went up you lose Ernest you lose your earn it um in general yeah\nThey're not all that but yeah a desert there's probably a finance contingency some of these things but burns money still actually there is no your answers\nSixty nine until prices start to come down\nA that's a great point and or the other thing is uh what about people that are in New build situations like right now they they they got into their new build safe three months ago\nAnd the property is get it got three more months to go and uh they got qualified the very beginning on a rate that was going to be at say five percent or foreign three eighths of foreign Seventy four and a half four and a half now why\nDid you did a ... because I Would imagine some of them are real close to qualifying knock qualifying uh and and you know not to mention builders cut builders contracts or non refundable\nSo if you can't qualify at the end because the rates went up\nYou lose Ernest you lose your um in general you know not in a maybe they're not all that\nBut yeah a desert there's probably a finance contingency some of these things but burns money still\nActually there is no answers do finance contingency in a new bill you you you put your money up you get qualified within thirty days or Fifteen days and you're you're on your way they're building that house based on your money\nSo ... H ... each contractors different by if you're doing a new building right now get out there find out what the rates are and see what your ah you know see what your variances\n[noise] well and plan for at least an additional point\nWould be my advice to the buyer you know um when I qualify for me though I always qualified at least a half above\n... percent above what the going rate is and I have one right now that it's supposed to close this month it's a small they'll they're it's taking them over six months\nYou know when we first started the process where in the low for and I find that convinced them to like a four point eight seven five he kept thinking that the rates are going to come down and I said I mean they could afford it didn't matter\nBut at the large alone alone or fifty three one their record ever present you know you're looking at eighty Ninety dollars a month for the next Thirty years so he finally locked in\nAnd he kept holding out hope that it was going to go down and now he's very grateful that he not locked him when he did\nWould be looking at five and a quarter I mean a lot of times you're you're dealing with using builders are a lot of times I've incentives like that could be a you know\nAllocated toward you know buying down your rate which which may be an option for some of you out there if you have run into that situation where rape spiked you didn't have enough leeway in your lock what have you uh look at the builder incentives or because you may have to do you have to look at buying down the rate\nUh okay yeah so we have and again if you have any questions about new bill financing or or any of the things we're talking about today in rising her direct line of suburban mortgage six to six six\nSixty seven twenty eight six six six sixty seven twenty eight let's see where are we with rate today do you want to start off ha\nYeah and it's oj good credit\nTwo hundred and eighty thousand cells praised the interest rate though hanging in there they're live five percent than NPR if I point it when to only payment Eighteen forty two thirty\nEighteen forty two now include mortgage insurance taxes insurance all of that each away an allowance\n... yes it's estimated in of course taxes are very all over the valley so you know it's something that you want to watch how about da\nDa da da di di di di ... to Ninety two\nAlright Seventeen twenty three still five percent VA how about a conventional at the end\nAnd then you know twenty percent then good credit where by plane to side with any of your five point three sticks or own fourteen twenty four forty four\nAlright fourteen twenty four the conventional financing based on two two eighty twenty percent down get your payment of fourteen\nOr just stay in it I mean you know some people have some equity in their house they only they don't want to capture the equity um and they they want to wait till prices fluctuate what have you\nIf you think that this market has topped and at your house is that is that they are upper end of its value why not try to sell it now live in it for a year in in ... in the market possibly gifts\nYou know well we actually I was talking to somebody after the show last week who says you know I Need to do a lot of work on my house but I really don't have the capital available to do that\nAnd that might be an option if this this seems to fit that price point in their model they will consider an offer a competitive market offer just give us a call we can get it to you\nFor into four or five one three three one eight four ... four or five one three three one eighty go on Elton brothers dot com and you can sign in an e mail us a your address and we can look it up and get you a competitive market offer on your home\n[noise] so that's something to consider a and so and so's works through two ways we work with a lot of investors obviously and I was just surprised to see Peoria at the top of the\nThe list the biggest regional increase Peoria wow that's like Gilbert was last week and that and by the way this is between September of twenty Seventeen and September twenty Eighteen\n\nTammy Gilbert and to and just to put a button on that\nPiece the uh\nThe average rent in Peoria eleven hundred and fourteen dollars which was a nine point five percent increase over last year or does\nIt say the dwelling on anything having to do that\nDot com you can sign in an e mail us a your address and we can look it up and get you a competitive market offer on your home\n[noise] so that's something to consider a and so and so's works through two ways we work with a lot of investors obviously and I was just surprised to see Peoria at the top of the\nThe list the biggest regional increase Peoria wow that's like Gilbert was last week and that and by the way this is between September twenty Seventeen and September twenty Eighteen\n...

school on a bulletin board they were using it\nYeah we have that today too so amazing let me tell you\nAlso didn't um there was this hill about a on a hill piece about John James he's West Point grad

again\nI mean for crying out loud it was in a school on a bulletin board they were using it as a lesson\nPeople chill the hell out and so now you have all of these idiotic media people who are lecturing him I don't think of us combat that going to need your all lecturing on fighting oppression so maybe just stop for a little bit\nOf we have more on the way we have that coming up we have also the latest with the hand what is that what he does he princesses\nHe is everything that a Democrat Claire McCaskill would fear Josh Hawley he Holly very much support the Trump Administration and he very much is is in line with\nThe immigration with the tax reform with the trade manufacturing et cetera\nBut he is very uh he'd law and order right he's super serious and I almost think that's a negative for him he's just not shrill and over the top he's not he's he's pretty laid back I mean he'll he'll get bought when he needs to but he's just lay back and he wants to get it done\nWhile people are running around waving their arms trying to distract from one identity politics tactic to the next he just gets it done\nAnd that almost kind of goes against him because a lot of people view that\nAs and mistakenly I think there's a lack of charisma and it's not that he doesn't have charisma it's just that he is\nVery serious when I'm not making the comparison either but I'm just saying no one would sit here and be like John Wayne is a charismatic he just says no charisma\nBecause he says periods no one would ever say that just people have different demeanor and that's his demeanor and I seriously doubt that he would have at all a had the time or be had been interested in participating in something like that\nGet real to my knowledge I don't even think he even knows\nJames's crew\nAnd while people are running around waving their arms trying to distract from one identity politics tactic to the next he didn't get that done\nAnd that almost kind of goes against him because a lot of people view that\nAs and mistakenly I think is a lack of charisma and it's not that he doesn't have charisma it's just that he is\nVery serious when I'm not making the comparison either but I'm just saying no one would sit here and be like John Wayne is a charismatic he didn't says no charisma\nBecause he says Syria no one would ever say that just people have different demeanor is and that's his demeanor and I seriously doubt that he would have at all a had the time or be had been interested in participating in something like that\nGet real ... to my knowledge I don't even think he even knows James's crew now there are people in Missouri who do because Missouri back in the day when I Lived there was a the hot that for activism uh but I think that was before a hall even came on the scene\nSo the I I think that was just a she lied that was a lie that she said\nShe lied again\nAnd she desperate to spin that says oh no this isn't so much an issue of me lying to voters about how moderate I Am and my staff telling voters that I'm going to I'm totally onboard with impeaching Trump or if the house and Senate somehow change hands to Democrat\nAnd we're just going to tell those moderate voters that supported me to get over it I mean that was literally the quote from her staff or they have to get over it and her staff or say well she supports should a of a ban on same item attic rifles\nNow McCaskill what's weird when she was talking to that reporter she wasn't than anything that was already not publicly known everyone knows that she ... she supports an assault weapons ban but here's the difference\nShe kinda got caught because when you're talking about an assault weapons ban you and I both know that a lot of people on the left used that as the term to mean all semi automatic rifle but they know that stain or semi automatic rifles will scare the crap out of you\nSo they don't say all of a semi automatic rifles they say a salt weapons\nSo active to suggest that they actually only the poor banning just a couple of kinds of semi automatic rifle but that really it but that's not what it is they're talking about going after I mean if you look and I have them easily pulled out the two thousand and two wells are all the way through two thousand and sixteen FBI uniformed crime reports which was the last\nCollection available and they'll have others coming up I think there's one singular twenty Seventeen report that's been published there is nothing for twenty Eighteen yet\nBut the two thousand and twelve and twenty sixteen report when you look at the breakdown and these are murder victims these are not people who are\nA suicide et cetera uh the vast majority if you're comparing quote unquote assault weapons with I don't know maybe the automobile accidents are hands feet and sets those are two and three times\nA deadlier than just quote unquote assault weapons and that is according to the FBI zone statistic which is easily available on line by Googling for FBI uniformed crime report UCR twenty twelve to twenty sixteen they also have it available in a PDF format\nHe'd like to save and keep it you know just for granting Google\nBut the bottom line is that it's it's not even at ... ... there's so many other things that are way deadlier but that's why they don't want to say that they say assault weapons they don't want to say semi automatic rifles\nBecause then you when you go after some automatic rifles and you're going to go after some automatic handgun and then you're just going to go after whatever else was left and that's the goal is incremental and they want to change the language which is why they made up these terms that when she gets out there and she says that you know before an assault weapons ban okay so semi automatic rifles\nAnd when she won't clarify that\nQuote unquote assault weapons and that's according to the FBI zone statistic which is easily available on line by Googling for FBI uniformed crime report do you see ours twenty twelve to twenty sixteen they also have it available in the PDF format\nHe'd like to save and keep it you know just for grants and go gold\nBut the bottom line is that it's it's not even at it and there's so many other things that are way deadlier but that's why they don't want to say they they say assault weapons they don't want to states them a semi automatic rifles\nBecause then you when you go after some automatic rifles and you're going to go after some automatic handgun and then he's going to go after whatever else is left and that's the goal is incremental and they want to change the language which is why they made up these terms but when she gets out there and she says that you know for an assault weapons ban okay so semi automatic rifles\nAnd when she won't clarify that well what what do you what are you what\nConclusion do you come to win a politician will not publically say no that's not true I don't do that and they're just quite from it and they run and hide from it what conclusion do you usually ... what do you usually think about an issue where a politician act like that which sounds like they're being a little\nDisingenuous sounds like they support it doesn't it yeah yeah I'm trying to make you believe otherwise yeah exactly\nThat's exactly it\nAnd so she knows very well is that how silly it was that she's sitting here accusing Josh Hawley\nIt's just silly\nAnd we've asked her on this program numerous times\nUm I've always been incredibly civil but I'm I'm going to disagree with you and I'm going to question you she looks at that as an act of incivility which is why at one press conference I asked her question and she began screaming at me\nShe was yelling at me in front of all of this media she was yelling at me she falsely accused me of working on her opponent's campaign and all of this stuff I'm like I've never ever worked on a campaign\nEver I have never worked on a campaign\nEver\nI'll support issues never worked on a campaign not since I was in college and it was for a Bill Clinton\nAnd I was just a little lowly volunteer don't hold it against me and said this is a reelection but\nYeah so um that's you know\nIt it was silly for her to say that the the thing is though is the press in Missouri seriously it's always been kind of weird\nBut they've got to\nI think it's media malpractice from Missouri press and I ask her where and and ... because isn't that the whole purpose of media\nI mean you are supposed to\nYou're you're you're supposed to get information and share it with people\nRight I mean she was asked about you know the stuff and it looks like she's really really are trying to hide her her full\nI'm really trying to hide what her positions are for moderate voters not in Missouri debate I think the Senate betas tonight\nSo mhm\nThat ... that Senate debate is uh from what I understand this evening now she is already demanded that there'll be a special prosecutor brought in to investigate the fraud she says\nWhat do you mean fraud\nWhen the hell was fraudulent\nBecause if you want to I mean we let's first defined what the fraud was what was the fraud the frogs seems is I mean when I look at it I see the front of you not being up front with your position senator\nI I see you trying to have it both ways\nHer full I'm really trying to hide what her positions are from moderate voters\n\nNot in Missouri debate I think the Senate betas tonight\nSo mhm\nThat's in ... that Senate debate is ah from what I understand this evening now she is already demanded that there'll be a special prosecutor brought in to investigate the fraud she says\nWhat do you mean fraud when the hell was fraudulent\nBecause if you want to I mean we let's first defined what the fraud was what was the fraud the frog seems\nIs I mean when I look at it I see the front of you not being up front with your position senator\nI I see you trying to have it both ways\n\nAnd a video showing where are you truly stand how has a video showing the truth fraud\nI Would love for that to be defined please just sign that where is that fraud\n[laughter]

passive income because it allows us to live where we want\nAnd invest where we want and we spent the first segment talking about the little bit about Laurie Ann and her history and moving around for jobs and never really being able to be where you want to be because something is dragging you elsewhere in order to make money\nAnd if you can create passive income that that cash flow that it's coming in every month without you working in that business or working very little in that business\nIt gives you tremendous freedom to live wherever in the country you want to live close to the people that you love and the things that you liked to do and invest where it makes sense to invest in Laurie\nWe've been working with a variety of as national uh folks people from across the United states and some from out of the country who are investing all over the United states\nAnd helping them with this concept and we've been doing this for years now we we launch our national program a couple of years ago but it's it's really been\nAbout six or seven years we've been diligently working with people across the country in this process can you tell us a little bit about how it all works and and talk about the national program and how people can actually make this happen in their lives\nSure well you had mentioned in the last segment we don't expect people if they are in a market not conducive for cash flow property\nAnd for investment by an old\nDo and invest where it makes sense to invest in Laurie we've been working with a variety of of national ah folks people from across the United states and some from out of the country who are investing all over the United states\nAnd helping them with this concept and we've been doing this for years now we we launched or national program a couple of years ago but it's it's really been\nAbout six or seven years we've been diligently working with people across the country in this process can you tell us a little bit about how it all works in and talk about the national program and how people can actually make this happen in their lives\n[noise] sure well you had mentioned in the last segment how we don't expect people if they are in a market but it's not conducive for cash flow properties\nAnd for investments by an whole property we don't expect them to give up their life and their job and move away from family pseudo moved to a an area of the country that that that meet the model\nAnd so that's why we teach people that you can do the model in any city that makes sense in any market that makes sense and so we we teach them the price point you've got to do two things in order to invest outside of your market and to analyze whether or not your market is a good one to invest in or not\nSo I'm going to pick on California for instance because their prices they're home prices are out of the ... out of the sky high and they go through the roof they're with their home prices and in order to get a Nineteen fifties or Nineteen sixties little bungalow you could pay half a million dollars for that\nAnd if you read price and went market doesn't support being able to pay for the expenses on a home of you that ah that that cost than it doesn't make sense to actually invested in that area\nThat that that's pretty simple and what would normally do we look at the average eye of the house what it's going to appraised for on the market\nAnd we can generally ballpark look at that and say well rent would probably in order for this to make a good investment property would need to be about one percent of the ... house so if you've got a hundred and Seventy thousand dollar house but you're going to purchase for an acquisition\nBy on hold for cash flow\nYou'd want to consider that you need at least Seventeen hundred dollars a month for rent\nAnd if people in that area aren't paying that amount well then that means that that house too high priced for the model\nSo what we do as we look for areas it's great if it happens in your own backyard because that gives us an advantage or more familiar with the neighborhoods we're familiar with ah which which areas are good and bad so to speak\nBut the thing is is that we can always if it's not in our backyard and if it's in another city or another state for that matter we can always go and look at that particular market and see what the rents are\nAre we can look at rental comp you couldn't even find that if you use search just a normal website like real for dot com or or something like that to be what rental homes or ... or in the area\nAnd then look at what prices at home or selling for and then you can put that one percent rule and see whether or not it makes sense\nSo um do you do your due diligence in the area because if you're not familiar with the area you'd want to look at crime statistics\nYou might want to contact your insurance agent or get an insurance person on your team that that's in the area and see what the insurance rates are going for so you can start calculating what expenses would be a for that property\nTo see how much that would be expenses on that property you're going to come out of the rent check the tenant will be paying the once you apply the same principles to any market you can find a good markets and invested\nSearch just a normal website like real for dot com or or something like that the what rental homes or ... or in the area and then look at what prices at home or selling for and then you can put that one percent will and see whether or not it makes that\nSo um do you do your due diligence in the area because if you're not familiar with the area you'd want to look at crime statistics you might want to contact your insurance agent or get an insurance person on your team that that's in the area\nAnd see what the insurance rates are going for that you can start calculating what benefits would be a for that property\nTo see how much that the expenses on that property you're going to come out of the rent check the attendant will be paying the once you apply the same principle to any market you can find a good markets and investing\nAnd if you can't find um something you know lots of times people get stuck because they want to invest in their own area\nAnd is so many many people are living in areas like you say where the the numbers really don't work out well for rental property which is why many of us live in areas that don't have a lot of renters in the area\nAnd but as they expand out from from where they live they can find many markets usually in a variety of states across the U.S\nWhere it makes sense and maybe there's some on the east coast in the west coast where your numbers are just so high that when you're charging for five thousand dollars a month for rent you're you're into a dynamic in the market that's that's difficult as a landlord it takes you longer find tenants even though people may have higher incomes\nThey also have higher higher expenses and so\nThey they get into a situation where you have the traditional tents taxes\nAnd and toilets where they're really looking at appreciation to maybe talk a little bit about our model and how we look at appreciation of as being the cherry on top instead of the foundation of the investment strategy\nExactly well what we all know that real estate is and appreciating asset so appreciation though is icing on the cake you don't want to go into a a a deal [noise] thinking that it's going to appreciate because that that other speculative nature\nThat we don't want to speculate on anything we want to run good from numbers and I'll tell you as long as there are properties in the price point cute to ah to afford\nTo to make a profit off of rent than appreciation shouldn't shouldn't have come into play that's just simply what you what you get into buying hold so for instance if you work you are if you if you go into a a market and it happened to be\nUm let's say a hundred and under two hundred thousand dollars and you look at that mark and will say well you know prices are going up at a rate of you know what they're really accelerating\nA ... and and so you would want to still not go in for initiation because that's mostly people are just going to speculate on that and then they they run the risk of getting burned you run the numbers the same on every deal no matter which markets\nAnd that's the the fundamentals that allow you to go through the market cycles and I think that's\nPart of what people don't understand about real estate because they've heard the stories about people losing a tremendous amount in real estate during a different bubbles and especially during the the most recent recession which is is fading into history at the moment but I'm causing us to forget\nThat mark off they well I think they are going up at a rate of you know what they're really accelerating or\nAn uncle who would want to still not going for ... that mostly people are just going to speculate on that they they run the risk of getting burned you run the numbers the same on every meal no matter which markets\nAnd that's the the fundamentals that allow you to go through the market cycles and I think that's\nPart of what people don't understand about real estate because they've heard the stories about people losing a tremendous amount in real estate during a different bubbles and especially during the the most recent recession which is is fading into history at the moment but I'm causing us to forget\nThen you also want to establish a a a team of people who can actually funneling find properties or you whether that be a team of of local realtor is in the area it might even be a\nConnecting up with an on line of what some of the real estate investing group leader in the area and you want to be able to put your property\nBut then you can run the numbers on each deal to ... to see if it makes sense but that's not enough just to\nFind the property and do that you've got to be prepared to take action once you do find a good deal because if it's a deal it's going to go pretty quick so you have to make sure that you've got everybody they're happier financing lined up made sure that it's a lender that lens in that area because\nThey're going to want to end and appraiser out to the property to make sure the value these are all checks and balances that we can use to make sure that acquisition it's going to be a good solid sound investment and we're not going to lose money on it\nYou know we look for these property we get our ... and we start being our due diligence as I had mentioned earlier ...\nWe'd want to make sure of the insurance costs on on that particular area a there are there are instances right here in the DFW metroplex where you will do from Dallas County to parents and the insurance rate is hard because parents county happens to have more uh more tornadoes and hail damage\nThan we did in Dallas County that each specific area you're going to want to hone in on those particular\nAspect of the property the once you've got your team you got a lender you're going to need if it's going to be a rehab property you're going to need a good to be a general contractor\nOr maybe you're going to go in with something that's not quite so are the fixed up and yelled at all you need a handyman you'll need to check out for things that are common in that area and these are all done by people for the two\nYou can see if it's common for foundation problems in that area that might be someone that you want on your team because they\nAll their all their instances like here in ... where you will do for ... to ... ... but the heart because ... county happens to have more uh more tornadoes and hail damage\nThan we do ... ... each area you're going to want to hold on and on those particular\nAspect of the property but once you've got your team you've got a lender you're going to need it going to be a we have ... what are you going to need a good to be a general contractor\nOr maybe you're going to go in with them will not quite so arguing with fixed up and you'll you won't need a handyman you'll need to check out for schools that are common in that area and these are all done by people who are just\nEqual the air it's common for foundation problems in that area that might be on one or two that they will go out and all that that people they can be your ... your ... on the ground floor you actually\nNeed eyes on the property need someone able to go out there for you so we have all the all white and our own ... in our area\nThe thing is you put in a little bit more ... to establish that came before you get into a property\nAnd that's I Know that's that's a powerful concept yeah and and ah I I to share and I get puzzled that a lone wolf\nA reputation that real estate investors have because we require such big teams in order to succeed you know you've got you've got your lenders your insurance agents you've got your contractors your handy man the trades you reverse your foundation folks your\nPlumbers and your electricians and it sounds like a big team to put together but it is not that difficult to put that team together\nAnd holding them together if you do what what we learn to do from Dell right which is to treat people while you pay your bills you have good communication you're educated and so you know what you want to do and you can speak with them and an educated way than they enjoy being part of your team they enjoyed the transitions they see you making\nIn your own business and in each property I should go whether that single family or multifamily and\nYou know you you talk about time getting to know the market at you and I went through an exercise in Las Vegas where we looked at property and in\nAbout an hour we got a handle on the market we learned some things that just delighted us and we we actually had a lot of fun together and evaluating property and we found out wow you know insurance is a lot less in Las Vegas than it is in Texas cities\nAnd you know every area has different things you know Phoenix has been a really fun market to evaluate I've enjoyed learning about Kentucky\nAnd um you know we're looking at different areas in St Louis and Kansas City and of course it Lana we've been\nThat members who have been investing in land for quite some time and I'm In Detroit since the recovery have been some amazing opportunities as well and each one of those markets has its own its own flavor and so you may have a

purely educational\nThis special edition episode is brought to you by killer Williams International\nK W labs in gateway mortgage group\nAnd what makes this show so special is that we have Mickey camera in here in the studio with us today from gateway mortgage group how you doing this morning Mickey attack that carry on doing excellent and you know I just wanted to let you know as the listener\nSome of the topics of today are unusual as usual\nAnd disruptive to the financial sector and if you don't allow yourself to slow down and listen to this whole show these topics may become disruptive to your personal finances and families\nSome of the topics we will be covering will be information that will change your life and secure your family's future\nSo anyway basically in a in a nutshell\nYou know I have Mickey camera in here today and she has been so immersed with in the back end of financial matters in mortgage real estate everything that has to do with the most important purchase that you possibly can make within your life\nThis show is disruptive enough\nOkay but I can tell you right now when you have real individuals and you know I I've been trying to get Mickey to tell you guys exactly how long she's been in the business and you know without you know wanting to date herself\nYou know I said over Thirty years [laughter] [laughter] well I have ... more years I came\nFrom one of the major banking lenders I won't say name but I tell you what they were so many rules and regulations and overlay that I thought that's the way life was\nBut ... years they're like dog years I'm like a hundred and sixty years old [laughter] I like good they think they have to wait you can't the listeners but I I'm not a I'm not worried\nFor sure Mickey and so I'm just glad I really wanted\nRight now when you have real individuals and you know I I've been trying to get Mickey to tell you guys exactly how long she's been in the business and you know without you know wanting to date herself\nYou know I said over Thirty years [laughter] [laughter] well I have two more years I came\nFrom one of the major banking lenders I won't say name but I tell you what they were so many rules and regulations and overlays and I thought that's the way life was\nThat ... years they're like dog years I'm like a hundred and sixty years old [laughter] I like that they think they just can't see less married but I I'm not a I'm not worried about yeah for\nSure Mickey and so I'm just glad I really wanted to drive home again you guys and you know I did mention you know kind of like how disruptive this can be because I Know which a lot of people get really really really\nJust caught up with the pace of life through the holidays in the holidays coming in you know my favorite holiday is ride around the corner\nAnd when we come into the holidays with the feds meeting two more times to raise interest rates what has taken place is that actually refinances have increased one point seven percent just within this month\nAnd when you look closely at kind of what the but the time versus money concept is technology doesn't care about that\nWe can use technology as a tool but we can't use technology in order to really get into the core matters of time versus money\nAnd you know these are some topics that aren't necessarily you know\nGoing to be covered within this particular special episode of the future of finance but that's kind of where this is heading organically\nIs time versus money and it's not to create a sense of urgency for you to pick up the phone like I said before this is purely educational for you to decide when you want to pick up the phone or when it's going to be the most important time\nFor you to pick up the phone and have a conversation with Mickey\nI think at that time is now and I don't ever think of anything as a waste of time\nSo you may be feeling like well you know I'm really not quite ready to buy into the spring or maybe in the summer but I've had so many people over the years that have come to me and we just talked about what it's going to look like and get that comfort level as yeah wow this is what the payments going to be\nThis is where I'd like to be then you get into that area which what hope\nAnd then I bring into reality but it's not good because it's better to know how to time than to go in blind so I always say the time now\nAnd you know that's a good point make it in that you know that's you know\nKind of it you know brings me to the fact that you know you you guys have heard Mickey speak directly to you about you know wanting a south facing driveway you know regarding you know the state of Colorado and I just want to make this very clear to you guys we have literally chosen\nCertain markets to really really assist with and the influx of what's coming in and out of the state of Colorado number one first and foremost from Colorado to Arizona and we all know the traveling back and forth\nAnd then I bring into reality but it's not bad because it's that it can never had a time and get going blind so I always say the title now\nAnd you know that's a good point Mickey and that you know that's you know\nTired of it you know brings me to the fact that you know you you guys have heard Mickey speak directly to you about you know wanting a south facing driveway you know regarding you know the state of Colorado and I just wanted to make this very clear to you guys we have literally chosen\nCertain markets to really really obsessed with and the influx of what's coming in and out of the state of Colorado number one first and foremost from Colorado to Arizona and we all know the traveling back and forth of the snow bird\nThe reason why that's important is that a lot of people do not understand that December is the most busiest time of the year with in real estate\nA lot of real estate agents don't even know that and they kind of just set their whole calendar up to say okay well I'm just going to take this next two to three weeks off\nWhile I can assure you with Keller Williams international and then also how gateway mortgage group had to position themselves\nAnd make the camera and as a host with myself Christopher bread well on the future of finance this December is going to be by far\nHow it's going to have more closings within the state of Colorado just because I have foresight within technology and what killer Williams has decided to do as far as purchasing certain bits and pieces of technology on the back end of even Zillow\nOkay in order and I all you have to do is watch\nYou know you know basically watch the news even on that topic that I'm bringing up to you within talk radio is that\nZillow stock is down there's there's certain companies out there\nToday that are even technology companies themselves that are being very very pressured and whether in because of disruptive technology\nAnd you know that's why I'm bringing the real human being to you giving you the access of eight four four yes gate the way to your future so you actually have the opportunity to pick up the phone right now\nAnd speak directly to Mickey camera and and this is an opportunity for you guys that's not going to always be there\nYou know and I just I Want to be honest with you so you don't get discouraged if you wait until December to pick up the phone and you can't even get a hold of Mickey camera and\nOh well well well well I have a strong team you will always be able to get a hold of me\nThat's what I Want to hear because I care more about you as the listener than anything that has to do with necessarily even the future of finance and because of the history of the future of finance you know that to be a fact\nI mean when it comes down to rhino philosophy when it comes down to home life balance\nTo be honest with you this is just a tool in order for me to connect you with somebody who really cares and you know Mickey\nThat brings us to a real for main topic which is compassion within the financial in banking industry which those two words because of my history with it\nMickey camera and oh well well well well\nI have a strong team you will always be able to get a hold of me well that's what I Want to hear because I care more about you as the listener\nThan anything that has to do with necessarily even the future of finance and because of the history of the future of finance you know that to be a fact\nI mean when it comes down to rhino philosophy when it comes down to home life balance\nTo be honest with you this is just a tool in order for me to connect you with somebody who really cares and you know Mickey\nThat brings us to a real for main topic which is compassion within the financial and banking industry which those two words because of my history within the business as far as being an asset manager dealing with the secondary market\nYou know working for some of the largest banks in the United states and you know\nJust compassion and financial banking industry\nAltogether it just like how do those words even how does that match how if you whether as being a woman of compassion\nOh you're kidding me it's not easy not every day there's the intent structure red tape Babylon\nCorporate sometimes my new shed that can make someone feel like they can't um uh-huh\nAnd that is what I feel in important to let everyone know that you can also no baseball\nHotdog apple pie and owning your own home\nIt's a big part of being in this country it's your opportunity and sometimes it may be not right now but it will be and that is really a big piece of mine moved to gateway gateway is very passionate about empowering families\nAnd they have a very strong work ethic and environment and to me a big part of mortgage is accountability and integrity\nSome things are outside of our control sometimes things get a little high plains on an inspection or value or whatever but I'm not going to turn tail and hide I'm right there up front and center with you negotiating\nI just you know as you're talking and I'm hearing that there's a real human being that is\nOn mass media that's physically reaching the airwaves as a host on the future of finance it gives me chills right now because you know and the fact that you can call one\nEight four four yes gate the way to your future is\nAbsolute it it just blows me away you guys ... and I'll tell you why\nIt really comes down to\nThree things you know and you know actually I'm not going to even tell you why I'm gonna let Mickey tell you why what that experience is going to be like when you actually pick up the phone and you know before we go there I Want to just you know think\nReal human being that is on mass media that's physically reaching the airwaves as a host on the future a finance it gives me chills right now because you know and the fact that you can call one\nEight four four yes gate the way to your future is\nAbsolute it it just blows me away you guys ... and I'll tell you why\nIt really comes down to basically three things\nYou know and you know actually I'm not going to even tell you why I'm gonna let Mickey tell you why\nWhat that experience is going to be like when you actually pick up the phone and you know before we go there\nI Want to just you know think every single every single one of my listeners [laughter] you know to you know to be sitting and listening closely why and I know why\nLike freedom you have now in order to really help like say for instance somebody who just graduated college and they're paying let's say\nThree thousand dollars a month downtown Denver for a one bedroom loft like ... you know and they don't even know they can afford a home to purchase a home like what are some of the tools that you have in your school box\nIn order to be able to let them know that hey you know what you're not going to have to resign that leaves you really\nGo ahead I Would say could send the first part of your question where I came from and the net a major lender\nLarge banking institution I never realized all the rules and overlay that I had and I think over the years as what I can do now like gateway that it couldn't be then all of them are people I could've helped\nSeriously when I came to gateway and I saw our minimal amount of overlays or in other words in the mortgage eats land that means extra both\nGuide kind of happy tears because they knew and I had so much more flexibility\nAnd the support\nOf a team that strong and underwriters that are compassionate it's a together in one big family up gateway\nAnd you know that's really neat because from my understanding and just so you guys you know yeah I Do I Am on the tax side I Do wear the tech guy and a lot of things I Want to provide technical information on it's just the way I'm wired\nYou know and it does have to do with the rhino philosophy of being able to rally around and you know [noise]\nGrant that mean extra herbal kite kind of happened to tears because they knew and I had so much more flexibility and support\nAs a team that strong and underwriters that are compassionate if a together in one big family gave way\nAnd you know that's really neat because from my understanding and just so you guys know yeah I Do I Am on the tax side I Do wear the tech guy and a lot of things I Want to provide technical information on it's just the way I'm wired\nYou know and it does have to do with the rhino philosophy of being able to rally around\nAnd you know just to recap you know just kind of just to you know let those who may not know what the rhino philosophy is is in a lot of people don't know this but in Africa if there is a fire\nUp to like a hundred million I mean\nTo me it would be a hundred million miles away because I wouldn't be able to even make it probably five miles in the middle of the desert of Africa but up to a hundred miles away a rhino if it smells a fire in the jungle\n... some of the fastest moving animals and they will\nThe whole herd won't run to where it sounds like an earthquake toward that fires that and they will run in a circle\nBefore intel suffocate the fire and puts the fire\nOut so that's really basically instead of this being you know a round table we're going to have gas coming on the show and you know instead of having it be a round table you guys have no idea how many rhinos\nThat are behind what we're doing here on the airwaves today there are so many rhinos that are running already\nBeing proactive instead of reactive and circling around where they are already see this little tiny tiny fire that's going to start in the jungle which I'm basically using it as an analogy for Wall Street\nGay because there are I'm not being negative by saying that there are going to be times that are changing because of technology because of the millennial generation who haven't been given the\nThe tools needed in ... and the education and knowledge like Mickey was saying of power the knowledge is power to be able to be calm homeowners become stable within their lives a lot of them have literally\nDriven themselves into debt to get the best possible education possible\nAnd\nThey think that they're stuck leasing at three thousand dollars a month you follow what I'm saying you guys so it's just really important you know and that's one of the things you know when I was actually going through the process of of you know through rhinos giving suggestions and\nI mean I'm not going to go into bragging on what you know who these people are and the type of backing that we have in order to make sure that hopefully every single person in the United states\nGet here what type of options they really do have to become a homeowner\nAnd also be able to position themselves to be able to weather the storm\nBut I'm telling you right now the first step is picking up the phone and not eight four four yes gate\nTo get the best possible education possible\nAnd they think that they're stuck leasing at three thousand dollars a month you follow what I'm saying you guys so it's just really important you know and that's one of the things you know when I was actually going through the process of of you know through rhinos giving suggestions and\nI mean I'm not going to go into bragging on what you know who these people are and the type of backing that we have in order to make sure that hopefully every single person in the United states get here what type of options they really do have to become a homeowner\nAnd also be able to position themselves to be able to weather the storm\nBut I'm telling you right now the first step is picking up the phone\nAnd not eight four four yes gate the way to your future again that a four four yes gate the wage here future and Mickey you know your heart for the millennials for as you say the young groups\nSay it's something that before this episode and I really want you to kind of speak to them directly and make sure that they understand that they're not dealing with somebody who is detached from exactly where they're at\nOh absolutely absolutely it just so much potential in every moment in New and infinite potential\nAnd I know my parents my creativity and stream I truly profound and I can achieve anything\nYou want you wake up in the morning at ... ... ... ... you can accomplish and with tried even more so\nAnd you know what's interesting is is that basically you know one of the reasons why Mickey camera and and this particular episode is so special because we are actually taking tons of resources\nAnd all the tools that we have to make sure that this generation that's coming up that's we're gonna have to give a major responsibility to\nThat they're well equipped better equipped than we ever were and that's by picking up the phone and calling a four four yes gate the way to your future again that aid for four yes gate the way to your future\nAnd we are not leaving the baby boomers behind\nThere are so many tools as far as on the remark reverse mortgage type of thing that Mickey I Know has but that's not what this particular episode of the future of finances about what it's about is making sure say for instance my identical twin boys look annoy just turned Eighteen\nOkay they both have had the best education\nTheir college has already paid for thank God\nBut the reality as they have no clue\nThat they could own a home right now I don't know why Mickey they don't teach with in like mainstream education even at the best universities unless someone is going to go to education specifically for finance and one of the things that I'm not saying this about any particular\nYou know educational institution but for some reason it's like it's kinda like top secret private information on what\nBut that's not what this particular episode of the future of finances about what it's about is making sure say for instance my identical twin boys Luke annoy just turned Eighteen okay they both have had the best education their college has already paid for thank God\nBut the reality as they have no clue\nThat they could own a home right now I

real estate it's still kind of leading thing telling everybody can be fun [laughter] [laughter] you\nDon't tell exactly you know so you guys pick up the phone at a four four yes gate the way to your future again that eight four four yes get the way to your future and there's so many more topics\nThat we're going to be equipping the millennials with especially within shows to come and ask this rose you know the San Francisco region\nOr I is a really really important region to us it's almost I mean literally connected to the hip with Boulder\nColorado and we see so many people comment\nInto Colorado from Silicon Valley with like they're like a deer in the headlights they're like oh my gosh\nWe can't believe property value is is where it's hot and and you know they're having to share one bedroom loss downtown and you know to where like say for instance you think oh well I can only afford like Seventeen fifty a month\nSo I'm going to split this last time I'm going to have to have a

I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about\nHow people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was the only two groups in and this was before Ferguson by the way some remember that part of it so whatever that you know few months before that so they re\n... there were only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy seven percent and the other was cops at about fifty two percent\nAnd one of the points I made was and again this was pretty Ferguson is you know there was a lot of pressure already be put on kind of people's views of cops and that may not be holding given that it was only fifty two percent back then and that would have very important implications\nI have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives are going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very ...\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people are predicting that I don't know if they're right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash and the idea of this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is\nBefore the market goes down you gotta know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I just want a thought too about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble they put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong\nAnd again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly if you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of games think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay\nIf you want Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down and you can on the move up so getting class we're gonna talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people will focus on what's called technical analysis they using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked with are like four okay you know you have your ... to camp to extend your are your uh see the eyes and you know there's a vote for thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one and within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\nThere are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the bats they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of the guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that\nSeveral thousands or hundreds of these things right so how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one and within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\nThere are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes [laughter] and that's a lot of this is that people use something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things are really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market to supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make there's a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we're wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing\nAs opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to be teaching

I've taught this class before it's always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those would be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world has changed in my opinion from a marketing arena manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you can always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at a charge than looking it indicators which are the wrong thing there's a fundamental we'd better approach again that I was teaching a class so if you want to come out you can get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch\nBe one of the next dozen callers at eighty four forty eight trader that's T.

Street Journal today that of the companies that are going public this year eighty three percent of them are losing money\nNow that is the highest in recorded history anytime they've tracked that this is the biggest number of it's ever been in his now eclipse what was happening in the year two thousand or eighty one percent of the companies were not profitable\nWhen companies are going public and then the stocks are going up which many of these stocks are where there are these ridiculous evaluation\nThere would've known as unicorn stock these companies that have no profits that are worth a billion dollars or more\nThat is a sign of a bubble and that is a sign that we are closer to the end than we are to the beginning of this Ron\nThere's another story I just read that\nCharles Schwab investors which a classic retail traders are now sitting on less cash than they've been at any time in history so they're becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market it's supply and demand if you've taken away the demand\nAnd there isn't more money on the sidelines to kind of come in and then what's going to take the market up to the next level\nNow what's been taking it up is companies buying back to their own stock and companies are buying back a record amount of stock this year they've never bought so much and that constrains supply and that could drive this market higher again\nThis is it I don't want to be giving you some big doom and gloom thing this market can keep going higher\nThan the repatriation of all that money coming back from overseas is a huge part of what's driving this market higher now it's a one time deal but some of the people aren't spending the money this year that could spend it next year so maybe you got a little bit left in the tank next year but at some point it has to come down\nAnd again we need to be prepared for that before it happens\nWe got to have the fundamental skills to be able to benefit from this happens\nBecause you can actually make more money faster on the downside than the upside but at a minimum we've got to know how to protect what we've got so again the classroom and to be teaching on before the crash what do you do and also what we're going to cover his what if he keeps going up what should we be doing\nThere's always a way to make money in this market but we always have to start with risk management\nAgain be one of the next dozen callers you can get to free tickets free tablet when you come out the number to call is eight for for eight eight seven twenty

the trade right side of the trade is brought you buy online training academy Phoenix deliberating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education All right this week we've been talking about\nThe ... kind of the state of the market and why I think we're closer to the top than the bottom at this point by a very long way and in fact why you may see a top in this market pretty soon\nYou know early this year I said I thought you'd see the top this year and we don't we haven't really gone much above where we were in January kind of gone back and forth around there\nYou know I said we could have one more run this year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year but what's going to keep taking this market higher and in the last segment I told you a little bit about what I see an evidence of the top and the market\nOne is the fact that more companies are going public selling shares initial public offering to ... cattle more companies that have no profits than ever in history so Wall Street journal today to the eighty three percent of the company's going public right now have an earnings are gone public the last twelve months no earnings\nIn two thousand the height of the dot com it was eighty one percent\nSo that again is kind of a big bubble each time\nNext big bubbly sign that the fact that you go to a place like Charles Schwab where it's retail traders not professionals\nOkay they have their customers have less cash sitting on the sidelines then they've had an ad I think at any time in history if I remember correct but they don't have a lot of extra money now you combine that with something else we've talked about before on the show which is what's called margin debt\nRight now in this country people are barred about six hundred and sixty billion dollars to buy stocks that's about three and a quarter percent of gross domestic product the entire US Economy so what's happening is is people are taking the money they have been buying stock because most people are massively behind the eight ball you know and trust and the other day\nThat if you look at people even in their sixties\nThe average person had something like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and assets okay hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars is going to get you anywhere with all due respect and retirement\nTo really get to where most people need to be you're talking millions which means most people aren't going to get where they need to be you can still do better but you know most people are going to be in the hole on that but a hundred and Seventy five not close\nBut what's amazing about it it's almost all equity in houses now part of what's driving the equity in houses is\nThe root for real estate the mortgage rates are so low but they're going up and here's kind of again of big key in the top when\nHave this much margin debt what happens is is that as people borrow more and more money to buy stock so like when you buy stock you don't have to put up all the money just put up half of it\nPart of what's driving the equity in houses is the root for real estate the mortgage rates are so low\nBut there are going up and here's kind of again a big key in the top when you have this much margin debt", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cave Creek", "day": "18",
