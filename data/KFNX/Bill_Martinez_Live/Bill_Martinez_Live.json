helping inflammatory response but it's one of the oil is that the kidneys really needs\nAnd at your age and wait I Would take about ten of those and capsules chewing suck out all the oil spill 'em out if you like and I would do that at your high protein meal and I would do that for maybe three months at the end of the time you should know that you feed a great\nThen you will cut down to maybe three to five kept as a maintenance okay\nThe other thing I Would do is go on kidneys support and the jury sides about three per meal\nAnd what you should see is almost an immediate support for that area within two three four days okay now the question becomes have used sustained as serious blow to your low back your pelvis you're as I joined the fact that both feeders swollen\nWorries me that you've

exactly I ended up damaging one of my ankles but also I was struck by the way around\nHere here's what I Would do I would assume it's nutrition get it under control when you finally stopped kidney support if the darn thing comes back then you need to have somebody look at your low back and mud pack and I just called me over the line they'll give you the number of someone near you there\nYeah I Do have a some pains in my lower back legs and feet well that\nDoesn't necessarily mean as an interference field there the pain and you're back in ... feet in my estimation the most common thing is that you're not getting enough minerals so you can get a roller ph paper and you can tell it's\nYour first morning urine ph you tear off a little piece pass it through the stream and it should go green\nThat's the color you looking for six point four to seven point or if it's blue you're in a moment you're you're an emergency how close is your super low and minerals as soon as you start minerals it'll go yellow about five and then it'll work its way back up and if you can't get it back up then you visit with someone\nIn your area there in Chicago there's a number of people and

I saw it up anyway so I I feel like I become that\n[laughter] yeah it's called the forced march I understand completely\nOK okay take them by now All right\nLet's go right back to the phones to go to Audrey in San jose and she's got a dad who's bone on bone in the right hip supposedly\nAre you there Audrey yes I Am how old is your dad and how much does he way\nSeventy five years old any land line\nOkay well here's what you need to know Audrey that\nHalf the time when they say that it's not true and the there's an underlying issue even if let's just assume for a minute it's true and they want to do a hip replacement the process that caused him to lose the bone\nIs unchanged so why would we think that a trauma like a hip replacement whatever he'll\nSee this is some kind of lunatic thinking that we have that it's very scary to me so the first thing you need to do for your dad is to get a roller ph paper and by the way of you do this Audrey you're blessed yourself\nLearn how to do this and you can have many many super healthy years\nSo first you get a roller ph paper and because of his age I Would not use ... trio but if you're a lot younger you could use ph trail it's cheaper but he would have to go on super nutrient trio where you would get our quantum greens mix and\nHe'd have to use maybe two to three tablespoons in a smoothie of the quantum greens to get enough to have the minerals he needs to push the ph into the ideals zone six four to seven oh\nAnd when you get there you'll be the healthiest and as long as you can stay there you will have the longest best life\nOkay and if you can get him there and it's going to be more of a fight for him because it's Seventy five he's producing zero in the way of digestive enzymes so we need to do here is put him on some of them\nHis age I Would not use ... trio but if you're a lot younger you could use ph trail it's cheaper but he would have to go on super nutrient trio where he would get our quantum greens mix and he'd have to use maybe two to three tablespoons in a smoothie\nOf the quantum greens to get enough to have the minerals he needs to push the ph into the ideals zone six four to seven oh\nAnd when you get there you'll be the healthiest and as long as you can stay there you will have the longest best life\nOkay and if you can get him there and it's going to be more of a fight for him because it's Seventy five he's producing zero in the way of digestive enzymes\nSo we need to do here is put him on some of them died just maybe two of those and at the end of the meals some detained Hedrick so right about four of those now is adjusting that we did in his twenties\nNow sometimes the ah had record gadget will cause burning and he won't like it\nThat they occur is if there's a trauma from the forehead to the big bone on the center line\nIf there is good for you know before he can get someone to mud back and eliminate that what he can do is take some stomach support\nAnd he would just take two capsules of that and make it as a tea drink it before he eats now stomach so on will be no burning from the age sale okay so no more rotting food we fixed that we give him enough minerals so we could push\nThe ph and so what could go wrong well the parents that road which controls the hormones for\nThe bone metabolism could be in trouble from a specially mixed dental restoration like a silver filling in a crown all the junk that many people have in their mouth so here you might have to use a couple of teaspoons of green tea PG\nTo get that guided test on and you may have to support kidney usually all we have to do with kidney is get them on some the age ... and maybe on may be five the caps at his main protein meal he can chew 'em and spit them out\nAnd now you've got all the ingredients needed to push the ph if he's still getting the ph you may have infection in gum may have a dead too that maybe something else going on and then what you would do is call the or the line get the number of a cue or a practitioner up there\nGet him over there will be able to test them find out what it is and get it fixed and in the same price as if you do this you will stay younger stronger healthier longer you'll have the most wonderful life and if\nThat ph crashes and you can't get it back up then you run to a cue or a practitioner who will get it back up you don't let yourself take a rocket sled ride to a graveyard\nOkay we'll say oh\nYou're welcome and if you couldn't catch all that you call the over the line and ah just tell him that you're Audrey from San jose and they can review everything\nFor you okay okay thank you You're welcome okay All right\nIs Dr Bob Marshall pitch Davis is help line line I Want to continue here with uh our discussion of the kidney and flew to addicts system and of course memory and brain function and of course these essential fatty acids\nYou'll have the most wonderful life and if that ph crashes and you can't get it back up then you run to a cue or a practitioner who will get it back up you don't let yourself take a rocket sled ride to a graveyard\nOK\nYou're welcome and if you couldn't catch all that you call the on the line and just tell him that you're Audrey from San jose and they can review everything\nFor you okay okay thank you You're welcome okay All right\nThis is Dr Bob Marshall pitch Davis is health one line I Want to continue here with uh our discussion of the kidney and flew to addicts system and of course\nMemory and brain function and of course these at Central fatty acids we've been talking about before\nEssential being the key word you're not going to be healthy from an elderly person to a baby without having\nThese wonderful critical essential fatty acids my most favorite of course his ... two hundred because it's a macro algae has sores so it's the clean is\nA least sores for any kind of weird heavy metal or PC bees it's literally free of these so it's a wonderful clean source\nAnd the ... has been also shown to be critical for maintaining healthy brain volume cognition and memory and of course being plants shores it's okay for you vegetarians as well\nAnd what else does the brain need though as we age well some of you may be down the road a bit and memory in concentration of very poor and ... a while it's going to be critical to maintain you and may help you\nYou're going to want more and the more it can be our quantum ribs ferret drawl\nOr because of this guy is great for brain health for overall energy it's one of the best antioxidants\nAnd it helps to clear or the bio accumulated junk DNA in the cell it promotes healthy DNA strand production and it actually can activate one of the keys to an anti aging jeans\nSo this guy is a real important when so red beret Jerome\nAn also have our big gun which is brain support and this is of course live sores rained formulation for superior brain processing performance and clarity and it contains all the key components for ideal brain function\nAnd it can also help you to target nutrition to the brain so like you're taking deejay with it can help to concentrate more than ... brain if that's what you need and for some of you they'll be associated neurological issues not just brain issues\nWith it can help to concentrate more than ... brain if that's what you need and for some of you they'll be associated neurological issues not just brain issues\nWell the first thing that you want to know because you're approaching the age where you can't just hardly anything in the way of cooked food so obviously your first step to reducing the irritation Indian testing is to make sure you can digest your food\nSo you would get on one of them died just to maybe take a couple of those at the start of the meal\nThe end of the meal about for the ... right\nNow you're digesting more like you did in your twenties and this shouldn't be any rotting food\nHitting the got now but the next step we have to look at is certain foods are more irritating than others\nCorn is one of those super irritate her show you'd want to get rid of corn and you'll want to add vitamin D three or we call it the three gold and maybe about six drops of this\nIn about one ounce of water and you would mix in that about four drops of lime and then now that's an essential oil of orange\nAnd it will uh most if I the D three so you mix it really good in the water and you see the big droplets of the three become tiny tiny now you know no matter what the state of your gall bladder you're going to absorb this this has been shown to promote\nThe best response to all of the\nKnown immune fractions two hundred plus immune fractions of body makes and it has been shown to be very helpful for all new coach so this may be just the kind of thing that you need Susan to get back to track now it's possible\nIf you're seeing candy to that you have a bug in the intestine\nAnd even doing these things you may still see some irritation if that's true then you really need to visit with someone who's mastered clinical nutrition\nSomebody who knows Q. R A quantum reflex analysis they're going to be able to test the balance and see if there's a bug or something else that needs to be attended to in the intestine and if you call the airline they can give you the number of people uh hopefully somewhere near you in New York\nOkay thank you I what I thought the fiber like ground screen criticizing the collapse job\nWell remember those little shooters you just got the big shoot\nJust the kind of thing that you need Susan to get back to track now it's possible\nIf you're seeing candied is it you have a bug in the intestine\nAnd even doing these things you may still see some irritation if that's true then you really need to visit with someone who's mastered clinical nutrition\nSomebody who knows cue or a quantum reflex analysis they're going to be able to test about let's see if there's a bug or something else that needs to be attended to in the intestine and if you call the ... they can give you the number of people uh hopefully somewhere near you in New York\nOkay thank you what are your thoughts about fiber like brown rice grain criticizing the collapse job\nWell remember those are little shooters you just got the big shooter which is vitamin D three now ... is a stand in immune system and if you get a good quality wanted scot free form demeanor glob village\nAnd the the guys that fight the battle first in the intestine so yes a collage from may be a real help\nWhat else did you ask about nuclear type newsletter\nThat I can also the glutamate of course is one of the foods for the bow lining but if we're going to go there the best way to go probably is to go with um fiber immune Rapinoe go acting is the active ingredient and\nThis guy from ... to ... the food for the lining of the intestine so all along the intestine this is gonna feed every cell there so if we're thinking the glue to mean I think this is a better way to go\nAnd you take just one or will it your body as I'd probably use two tablespoons\nYou can mix Senate and the smoothie if you want you could take it in the morning or afternoon\nBut that would be my favorite but start with the basics so many people Dr Robert canal at UCLA has shown just about everybody is vitamin D deficient and if that's the case you know your your you know trying to put some to ACT UP with a sledgehammer\nLet's go back to the basics and if the basics don't do it by all means you can always add the other Asia's okay\nThey three for starters hand held\n... with the linemen and digest NHL that's your stark\nOkay okay I meant by the way my check your favorites which I Love that takes a lot that oh\nWell because of the fact that it's a sort of a probe addicts suspension you can take him anywhere but usually we recommend you take 'em half the breakfast earlier in the day because that's when you'll be able to use them the most\nOf it and I think I sit on it like out of\nThat will be fine that's even better if you are willing to do that\n[laughter] it doesn't matter if I had food and my stomach you know it does now how can I ask is how much better or right\nThis is Dr Bob Marshall pitch said this is health one in line\nFor

so you know the minimum is twelve months the ideal thing is Eighteen to twenty four months so by the introduction of food of course her the jets for drags not ready\nSo all manner of weird things can happen [noise] so what do you have to do now\nIs the damage control so number one other than your breast milk she shouldn't be getting any meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products okay that would be number one\nNumber two we've got a check to be sure you are getting enough salt so she's getting enough soldiers who she can make enough hydro cleric acid at her stomach to kill any of the bugs that are in the body\nAnd whenever we see his skin problem you always want to think of the intestine something's wrong in the intestine so whatever you're feeding her you want to make sure that none of the

done taped\nOkay why is that uh the I'm not\nGetting out the had them I think it's just so off the soft and get a\nEasily decay yeah OK well but that's not a reason to remove him because that gives you a lot of biting surface in my opinion is you always want to keep every two to you got your mouth\nOr what I Would do of course is to make sure that she brushes and flaws says and you monitor that choose to make sure and if it does decay you can use the low fusing ceramic materials we stronger than your original to\nOnce it's laser bonded in there and then you keep all inviting surface you see the upper teeth of your mouth are used by the body to respirator the base of the brain so you don't want to lose a to Z unless it's inside ways are infected or something's really bad about it

Green Zone six four to seven oh\nNow she consumes a lot of dairy products or\nOr meat fish poultry eggs in may be very difficult to have this ph where it belongs and when it's not there then it's very common that wheel grind or teeth\nSo I Would keep the by guard until you can see a first morning urine ph that holds for a good two three four weeks\nStraight then you know that she probably won't need the bike guard OK\nOkay and I have a question I have to clean up clean has that problem and I had a stomach or they must have taught for spicy for stomach hot\nOkay we'll have spicy food or for certain body types the ... body types like pit that are hard for them to handle so I wouldn't I wouldn't\nOr meat fish poultry eggs it may be very difficult to have this ph where it belongs and when

Nineteen fifties from the work done by the Pasteur Institute in France that these are the result the acme is a result of disordered bacterial ecology of the gut and it's very hard to fix it\nBut if she is steadfast she can get on to something like garlic aside and to break the tough little bio films that are in the ... how much does she weigh in how old is she\nAnd her name fifty five\nO K so what you would want to do here is have about two to three girl aside and per meal and that will help to break any of these bio films that are in the guts and then you'd want her to have some kind of a good\nProbiotic to take in this case the you wouldn't want to like you get our robotic it's in a ... being capsules all you have to do a swallow it\nAnd that will target the large intestine and that's

actually the active fraction of garlic Allison and this is a great and gentle\nBio film buster in for the genital urinary tract and again about for pre meal and I would do this for about three to four weeks\nAnd if you see that it's\nSteadily better and better I Would carry this out for about six to eight weeks and then stop a lord willing that promotes the best structure and function for the

guess the pain is that something I think about coming from the hip\nYes have you noticed that the arches of your feet are collapsing yes yes that very commonly is coming as a result of the problem of a very old injury usually to the say cruel area and fall\nYes yes and so you need to find someone who knows puree quantum reflex analysis and knows the latest in mud packing cold ice packs and they can pack that say grill area get it to test on\nAnd then you could get yourself a very cheap\nSet of water called walk fits from target or any of these places\nThere are about twenty bucks and don't

health journey\nDo that probably fairly that an average kind of\nThing that really\nIt's amusing to me they didn't let you know all the options\n[laughter]\nThis is because sometimes is selling one option and not another um but you know you read proverbs it says through the council of many wise men wives plans are made so you don't just listen to one guy\nIncluding including me okay [laughter]\nHowever I have no financial axe to grind decay which is quite different so I agree that there could be a circulatory issue\nI don't agree that the circulatory issues solution is necessarily that surgery it may be that he played sports and he's had his incurred an interference field an injury to his low back\nOr to the ... for it to the tail bones that is the dating the normal energy flow through that area and the first thing that should be done is to look for that because what will happen if you do the surgery is you will now for sure\nHave at least one major interference field\nIf not to the second one being from his childhood or adolescence from some kind of injury so uh if you're in Modesto would I Would do is\nGreed that there could be a circulatory issue I don't agree that the circulatory issues solution is necessarily that surgery it\nMay be that he played sports\nAnd he's had his incurred an interference field an injury to his low back or to the ... for it

the ...\nGet the number of a cure a person be sure they know how to do much ... called the ... the letter ice packs and if they do then have them check your husband and see if there's an interference field\nIf there is let's mud pack the darn thing let's get him on something called delta boost to promote\nThe best circulation it may be two per day and also get him on a obviously short few gold to\nSee if we can promote the circulation without a knife and a simple retail ... of the sperm will tell you this his work do you need about a six week time I suspect you're young and have plenty of time and you really don't want him chopped up if he doesn't need to be\nA way I think well\nYeah I'm not sure that's necessary I've dealt with a number of these and in I'm I've been doing this over forty years and I can tell you that I've dealt with maybe a hundred disease and\nCannot recall one that was not an interference field so almost fishery latest sport he took a whack he fell in his bike he did some dumb thing and it's Twenty years later or whatever and the interference field has had enough time to make a real mess\nOkay thinking\nThat he's also right that could be born with it however if he was born with it it would be unlikely that he would have hardly anything in the way of sperm till it and\nHe is two percent so that he could be right about that I don't want to diminish that that is positive but if you were born with it it's still an interference field\nAs far as I tell her the climate everything is great except for college and the shape of the actual federal fell out that I'm a tech yes\nThere is one of the things that can help and it's called royal jelly okay\nAnd you can call you at all and they will have that he will need that his buddies there's probably need to use about but tease from the day\nAfter the quake or how much\nI Would use about three per meal just for the six week period to see if that does the job and then we're retesting six weeks and see what the morphology or ...\nOkay\nMark college shape the actual federal [noise] I'll say I'm a tech yes\nThere is one of the things that can help and it's called royal jelly okay and you can call the ... they will have that he will need that his buddies as probably need to use about but he's from a day [noise]\n[noise] I Can't think of how\nI Would use about three per meal just for the six week period to see if that does the job and then we're retesting six weeks and see what the morphology or ...\nOkay [noise] [noise] [noise] oh that's\nGood well I'll tell you the key thing kiddo since we've been paying attention is to hold the morning you were in the edge in the Green Zone six forty seven too if you can do that you're in great physiology to have a baby OK than if you can't do that you'd better hurry up and get their\nCars not going to be fun if you're losing bone and you have the baby you're going to have a rough run\nOkay All right to take care of how will come back I\nThis is Dr Bob Marshall pitch the this is health line live and ran spring your nutrition and health related calls you reaches toll free eight eighty eight\nFive eighty eight Seventy five Seventy six the next thing that we wanted to covered today is\nOf the prostate because this also plays a very key role in mail help and there's been so much research and information regarding\nThe prostate but basically the first step to promote the best health for the urinary tract to end the ... is pollen floor to promote its best to help\nAnd if there's no improvement or not enough improvement there than there was no reason to not go on to something stronger like our products they support which provides the best support I haven't been able to find on the planet for the prostate and the urinary tract in men\nAnd here you might go to two or three per meal depending on how big a person you are\nAnd this guy you you need thirty to sixty days to see if it's working well but um this is the best combination of nutrients support for the prostate I've been able to find so I think that can be another really really great age\nI Do think that like opinion which would come from\nTomato and tomato concentrates a male she'll be of help for the prostate\nAnd uh we have a product called quantum tomato that's just loaded with like opinion it's one of the nicest ways to get like opinion and for many of you who consume a good bit of tomatoes that may not be the player or you may need prostate support\nSo what else can affect the the prostate will\nPut some of you on medications which May of induced a process they challenge magnesium males so be helpful but there are many many of you out there that have had injuries to the head or to the upper or lower front for teeth these points\nThey're really really great age I Do think that like opinion which would come from tomato and tomato concentrates a male to be of help for the prostate\nAnd uh we have a product called quantum tomato that's just loaded with like opinions one of the nicest ways to get like opinion and for many of you who consume a good bit of tomatoes that may not be the player or you may need products they support\nSo what else can affect the the prostate will\nPut some of the ... on medications which many of them do a process they challenge magnesium also be helpful but there are many many of you out there that have had injuries to the head or to the upper or lower front for tea\nThese points may reflects directly to the prostate or you've had at the sec to me or a hernia surgery and\nA few years later you're experiencing issues with prostate this is the interference field in something you definitely want to deal with\nBecause each four or five years to go buy it just keeps getting worse and worse and interference field or scarred traumas that are sitting there helping Andrew floated the key organ or Glenn\nAnd their unrelenting slow but unrelenting nutrients can slow them down but nothing did stop some so you want to get a mud back then get rid of him to\nDo that you visit someone who knows ... just give a bus tour or the line\nAnd they can give you the number of someone and are they going to help you with today's special or prostate support and our quantum tomato which is really a great tasting player on the block\nJust give us ... eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven to eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven lived school rate bank to the phones here who had to go to\nLive in Milwaukee and she's just did some immunity issues and vision issues ever since she started having these ah immunity issues are right are you there Lynn\nYes I Am how old woman or even how much do we have\nSixty six years old I weigh ... pounds\nOr ... well the first thing you want to know is the main reason your immune system's crept out you can visit with things you had as a child\nIs because you can't just your food so\nLet me just say I I think I've seen every day six days a week in my life schedule around your radio program and every thing is I forget where it and I have not been trying to\nKilling a girl and I was\nLike you know the healthier sixty six year old or younger in my class for like four years ever since I've been standing on getting everything got ph screen it took me forever to it but I'm I'm ... several months now and I'm doing great\nAnd I was like you know the healthier sixty six year old or younger in my dad size class for like four years ever since I've been standing on getting everything you say I've got ph green it took me forever to do it but I'm I'm ... several months\nIn America we're manufacturing these and we cannot manufactured to the purity of precision that they can at this time\nSo that is why and what I'm going to say to you Richard is you try our as if you don't think it's the best year ever reuse return it will give you a refund but I'm going to tell you once you get it you're hooked [laughter]\nProtocol that has a few of them with like the first\nOne or two died just at the start of a meal even if you forget and take it at the end works almost as good in the end you would take a couple of age CEO and you know that it's working because there'll be no ... on your teeth and\nIf you have black on your deep you know you have low Hedrick Oric as it or the other problem we have is we pass forty and that includes you is that we're facing a real gall bladder crises in America everybody has something going on with their ...\nAnd what we have the news is that much of it is from eating highly heated\nOils in any food cooked over the boiling point first of all their lives it's a massive white cell response so it's going to make you tired right away 'cause you won't have any red cells left which is what gives you energy but\nAlso the body is chasing these because it sees them as a problem and meal after meal we do these things plus we're getting large amounts of oil is that we can't just well so if I were you I Would take a Ninety day holiday\nFrom all of the olive oil salad with oil and it just used vinegar coconut oil anything loaded with oil any food just take a holiday and see what wonderful things happened to your body and get on\nSome gall bladder PG and\nAt your body weight and maybe about three to four teaspoons and use this for about four months even if the terrible gas is not from there but I think it is at least in part then this is going to give you the most beautiful hair and skin after three weeks you'll start some coffee and them as\nTwo per week and\nNothing I've seen in my lifetime\nGives more beautiful Harris skin male or female and let me tell you you can stay looking and feeling the way you do now for many many years to come if you can solve the digestion issue and get your body into a state where you can\nAnything loaded with oil any food just take a holiday and see what wonderful things happened to your body and get on some gall bladder PG\nAnd at your body weight and maybe about three to four teaspoons and use this for about four months even if the terrible gas is not from there but I think it is at least in part\nThen this is going to give you the most beautiful hair and skin after three weeks you'll start some coffee animas\nTwo per week and\nNothing I've seen in my lifetime\nGives more beautiful Harris skin male or female\nAnd let me tell you you can stay looking and feeling the way you do now for many many years to come if you can solve the digestion issue\nAnd get your body into a state where you can hold your first morning urine ph in the Green Zone six point four to seven point no so long as you can do that you know you got great health great physiology okay\nThanks so much for it yeah I really appreciate it take care of\nAll right this is about Marshall PHD this is helpline live let's go right back to the phones let's go to Harry in Miami and uh he's concerned about his mom who's having some low back issues are you there hairy\nDog in a a a call about my mom she either out for an hour five Laura I'm bar ... company they come ... ... ... the fad it around shutting down\nVery an unpleasant yep how old a woman and she and how much does she weigh\n... ... ...\nOkay so the first thing you need to know is that\nAlmost for sure she's in bone loss and guaranteed eighty three eighty six\nShe cannot digest your food without having digestive enzymes support so before she eats a single thing she should be taking one of them died just\nAnd toward the end of the meal about\nTwo or even three but teen Hedrick Laura right now she'll be adjusting more like she did in their twenties the next step is to get her minerals better and the way we're going to do that\nIs to get her on something called Bowman joined support here you'll probably need to use\nAbout three caps for meal and you're going to need even more in the way of minerals so I Would make her a smoothie\nMaybe in the afternoon and then the smoothie we could put two or three tablespoons of greens mix\nQuantum grains is what the product is called\nAnd that's loaded with minerals that won't stress her kidneys like regular minerals because at her age I'm sure that could be an issue as well now with these things done she can get something called the hang up\nThis is a devise where you step into it and it can invert you when we have a problem like this you do not want to win Vert completely there's a strap on the machine that can restrict it so that you only invert forty five degrees\nAnd her goal would be ten minutes that means Fifteen times she would do twenty seconds erect twenty seconds inverted and that it\nTablespoons of greens mix quantum greens is what the product is called\nAnd that's loaded with minerals that won't stress her kidneys like regular minerals because at her age I'm sure that could be an issue as well now with these things done she can get something called the hang up\nThis is a devise where you step into it and it can invert you when we have a problem like this you do not want to invert completely there's a strap on the machine that can restrict it so that you only invert forty five degrees\nAnd her goal would be ten minutes\nThat means Fifteen times she would do twenty seconds erect twenty seconds inverted\nAnd ... is that the data K. to hang up yes it is exactly that\nAnd yet I I that's why I call 'cause I wanted to know if I could put at five or heroin that\nYes you can but remember you don't want her to fully invert yet because those two vertebrae may not be able to handle that\nAnd what you wanted to do is ... the spinal fluid you can achieve that not as good but you can achieve that by restricting hurt to forty five degrees OK\nYeah thought that I bought one from you add it actually I have it at a forty five degree\nAngle now you need to do it morning and night okay\nRight right right on that night last night but I have a increase at the market and\nThen we have to do it both trust me okay dot\nDot quiet and and what what do I do for a nation like why did very humid down here which is almost every day she she has a lot of pain go to the information on arthritis in fact\nWell remember the first step is to stop rotting food\nFrom getting into the system that's why the digestion is so important in the bone and joint are compounds that promote healthy inflammatory response in that area a these are things you can do immediately\nThere could be we could do more adding da ... ten for a day at her main meal she could just two days and spit out the capsule or swallow them\nWhen these are taken in ... amount of five or more uh they promote healthy inflammatory response so you can do a little more for her that way there's even more that can be done\nWhat I Would say is you start here and if you want more give a bus to the or the line to visit with someone who is mastered cure a quantum reflex analysis\nThey're going to be able to test her pinpoint exactly what else she needs\nOkay [noise] okay [noise] I've I thank you very much good talking to you know thinking okay\nThis is talk about Marshall pitch day this is held one in line oven or answering your nutrition and health related calls you reach its toll free AAA\nFive eight eight Seventy five to seven eight six and\nDon't ms today is really great specials if you tuned it'll later we were focusing on all the major mucus membranes into Bani the bladder and urinary tract the Bronx state and the lungs and the last thing we use chatted about was the lungs but they all have one nutrient income and\nThey all need vitamin D three and boy you\nWant to jump on that it's inexpensive it's convenient and just about no one on earth is vitamin D sufficient as soon as we put gloves on it's hard for all of us to have ideal levels of deep three and that means that it's going to be tougher\n... says helped one live and we're answering your nutrition and health related calls you

deep three and that means that it's going to be tougher\nFor us to have the best bones metabolism because the three is needed there it's going to be tougher for us to have the best immune response because it's literally every aspect of the immune system depends on vitamin D three [noise]\nAnd if that's not enough all the mucus membranes depend on it from the lungs all the way through to the intestines and the prostate\nThey all depend on vitamin D three so be sure that you get on our deep three gold and if you're over forty forty or over you ought to add Lyman with it so that you can be sure it's fully multiplied and easy to absorb\nAnd that guy will help across the board for the bladder the prostate the lungs everybody\nBut do remember the lungs are your back up to the large intestine\nAnd the two ways that literally everybody in America dies\nIs one they don't have enough minerals and two they can't digest it absorbed their food so somewhere around age thirty it's a really good idea to begin supporting your digestive system\nSo you don't have to deal with a crash when you're forty or fifty or sixty so to do that you'd get on her quantum digest and are the pain

how much will come back to live when you take it so I Lived sores products don't have that problem\nThe second problem you have is that if the capsule or the delivery system breaks down in the small intestine\nThen the odds of the anaerobic organisms like bitter do making it to the large intestine are very poor so the capsule would need to be a very space age capsule\nIn other words it would need to have the apps adopt fellows product in a capsule that would liberate in the stomach and small intestine\nAnd the bits that old products being micro encapsulated so they would deliver into the large intestine\nWhat we have is they are a product that is all lives shores and it's in an ... bean capsule so that means if you want to target the mouth and the upper GI\nYou choose a capsule and on to target the large intestine you swallow the capsule\nSo ... that says ah it won gold medal awards in Japan many years ago and to me it's kind of the gold standard of pro by Arctic and you need to remember many people are taking probiotics\nBecause the gut Flora is a ... from not being able to digest the food so the probiotic is a band aid and it's never going to really get the help they're

taken years didn't cover and like she can come and go down in their own health Sunni Dr Marshall recommend that almost all life story three is questionable and calculating agent\nEverything you can think of goes wrong so the first thing you want to do is get him on some digestive support probably to quantum died just at the start of the main meal yes for him because of his age\nAnd then at the end of the meal you want to start with to between ... and maybe if he tolerates that will go to for if he gets any burning or any problem with the age she um just him drink a lot of water it'll stop but\nLike I face that fact to what they are going to digest\nOh okay\nSo now with the HDL if he has any negative reaction you may have to stop get some stomach support\nAnd have him make a T beforehand or with two capsules and you can do that before each main meal and then the digest and aid shell work perfectly until you have time to visit with someone who knows ... and they can\nFind the interference field should sit dating stomach\nPacket and then you will need systemic support anymore\nThat makes a gang fight yeah yes ... okay\nWell I guess we'll just your main meal yet somehow okay All right and now to support his gall bladder what we need to do here is get on to something called gall bladder PG\nAnd add to hear that body weight and age about three cheese balloons and you mix is in maybe six ounces of water and drink\nHand or with two capsules and he can do that before each main meal and then the digest NHL work perfectly until you have time to visit with someone who knows cue or a and they can find the interference field should sit dating stomach\nPacket and then you will need systemic support any more\nGang fight yeah yes ... ... cap the well just your main meal is somehow\nOkay All right and now to support his gall bladder what we need to do here is get on to something called gall bladder PG\nAnd add to hear that body weight and age about three teased foods and you're mixed is in maybe six ounces of water and drink it after breakfast K. and he's going to use this for about four months\nNow he has two choices he can do after three weeks he can start to coffee enemies\nPer week or if he doesn't want to do that and men resist is like the play he can he can go on the battlefield diet and the mayor is is that even more but uh that would be the biggest help for him\nAnd then typically you wouldn't need to do the coffee animas and you can see even at his age just a spectacular change that the body can produce it only knows how to be well\nYou got to send it in the right direction the battlefield that of course will reduce those gold medals load that has made a mess to begin with OK\nOkay All right so\nYou're welcome by them\nRight let's is docked

and joined us during the week Monday through friday we've got a half hour show you can see it there and\nUsually a lot easier to get through with your questions as well to end labs dot com\nAnd today we're talking about hair skin and nails and so we we'd be remiss if we didn't talk a little bit about blemishes than on cystic acne you know a is acne issue is something that is a been traced by the Pasteur Institute way back in the Nineteen fifties\nTo disordered bacterial ecology and of course the Pasteur Institute tried probiotics to ah help correct this the u._s. tried antibiotics and of course neither word\nAnd one of the reasons of course we've had to learn is the micro biome which is almost got a mind of its own it's the bacterial\nUh ecology of or a gun is really dug in to the lining of the intestine\nAnd there's just no place for a new comer of a probiotic to set up housekeeping show we've got to make some room for it and unfortunately what we've found is that sticky polysaccharides or sugary sex\nCan exist in the intestine and especially when you haven't been breastfed especially when\nTruly college game and of course the Pasteur Institute tried probiotics to ah help correct this the U. S. dried antibiotics and of course neither work\nAnd one of the reasons of course we've had to learn is the micro biome which is almost got a mind of its own it's bacterial\nUh ecology of our gun is really dug in to the lining of the intestine and there's just no place for\nA new comer of a probiotic to set up housekeeping show we've got to make some room for it and unfortunately what we've found is that sticky polysaccharides or sugary sex\nCan exist in the intestine and especially when you haven't been breastfed especially when there's been a long term antibiotic use and especially when there's been food poisoning or parasitic infections\nAnd so the intestine may have these sticky fill me bio films and they've glued on to the intestine or any mucus membrane harder than dried mucus and you know it was so they're really they're really got a death grip\nAnd we're the only thing we found that can really help\nThe body unglued these things and clear the air is so a probiotic can get in and ... has been a form of garlic the active fraction Allison we call it garlic aside and and\nIt's effective but gentle bio film buff strict and it breaks the mile films in the guts and allows the good bacteria\nTo host so now when we take a probiotic it can do some good but this process\nIs a slow process it may take a year or two because that got micro biome is an extraordinarily protective ah environment meant to keep you healthy but really what it does is keep you wherever you are\nAnd so the move is slow move but it can be a wonderful movie so jumping on some garlic side and and some really good probiotic like our probiotics support\nAnd swallowing those because they're in a low because being a capsule and if you choose and they'd be liberating the probiotic for the mouth and the upper GI\nBut when you swallow on them they have the ... effect and target the large intestine so that can be just great help for dealing with the acne and topic leading not much of anything works because the problem is really systemic\nAlso it's important to understand that the fried foods and sugars can actually make the acme words\nAnd [laughter] ah one of the things we can do is try to more effectively digest and absorb those foods\nSo we can jump on in addition to our quantum died just some quantum zions which of course are designed to promote a further a breakdown of gluten amino acids and sugars on the bow aligning itself\nSo today we will have our garlic siding probiotics ship for it\nAnd want those arms on special by to get twenty five percent off each just give a buzz ... eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven or eight hundred\nFried foods and sugars can actually make the acme words\nAnd [laughter] ah one of the things we can do is try to more effectively digest\nAnd absorb those foods so we can jump on in addition to our quantum died just some quantum zions which of course are designed to promote a further a breakdown of gluten amino acids and sugars on the bowel lining itself\nSo today we will have our garlic siding probiotic support\nAnd want them zone arms on special by to\nGet twenty five percent off each just give a buzz ... eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven to eight hundred three Seventy\nThirty four forty seven alright let's go right back to the phones let's go to Deborah in Beaverton, Oregon and she's got advanced or a sphere ferocious and this is almost a nationwide epidemic are you there Deborah\nYes I Am and how old woman or even how much you weigh I'm sixty four Atlanta hiring thirty four\nWell the first thing I Want to tell you is I Believe this is a hundred percent fixable so our first step\nWould be to get a roller ph paper and I don't know what state your kidneys or in whether you get leg swelling or\nAny pain or any your show I Know I get half kidneys are good for the case then you can't be able to jump on the edge trail and\nYou should also be able to take about\nFor bone and joins support these are for six phone and for a few ferocious um has has all the players that the body needs so our goal of course is to get the first morning you were in ph into the Green Zone\nExploit four to seven point out now the three ... tour is number one kidney number to Paris I read most common\nAnswer ferrets arid we can usually get it it just on with a couple of ... ... if you'd kidneys are good we won't even go there\nThen we'll start checking every three days and see if we can move this ph usually when you're severely honesty of product\nIf ph will actually showed blew\nA which means uh the body is producing ammonia the mineral status is so poor so so what happens is in within a couple of days it crashes down to orange around five and then it starts working its way out\nAnd if we don't have any infection anywhere it works its way up beautifully\nIf we have infection will get closed and it'll balance in and out it won't hold\nAnd there you might have gum infection you might have did choose you may have some other problem and if that's the case\nAnd now they won't hold and there you might have gum infection you might as it did choose you may have some other problem and if that's the case\nAnd then you can cut to two at breakfast only okay\nThen the other thing we've got to do to make sure that it's not rotting food that's waking you up is to get you on digestive support and had her for a gas it so maybe to quantum died just at the start of your main meal and then the end of the meal about four\nTo five detain hydro chloride now you're digesting more like you did as a twenty year old\nSo now I think this should be a tremendous help the lack of sleep\nWill cause you to excrete magnesium which can tend to make the intestines and the bows much harder so you could jump on some of our magnesium four hundred and take a couple of teaspoons a morning and night for\nProbably five days and now you should start having very easy to pass by movements\nAnd then I Would cut two um two teaspoons am only okay\nAnd I think it should doing his job for you a lot of people tell me at your age so that they prefer a teaspoon morning and night\nRather than taking it all at once in the day because you're still screening chill we rebuild those adrenal 's okay [noise] I Hope that's a big help for you and your and take care of by now\nRight this is asked about Marshall Fitz Jesus is health when you live\nAnd I know we've been talking about the hair skin and nails and of course they need college in and one of the key players just to make sure you have adequate vitamin C. every day\nSo if you can't get grapefruit orange or don't like them or feel like a switch and or you're on the road and you can't do it I urge you to have a bottle of our quantum vitamin C. it's real vitamin C. and not just the score because it\nSo it's going to keep on working for you and it doesn't have the risk of becoming a free radical because it's loaded with the bio lab annoyed that keep regenerating the vitamin C.\nThat's the difference between real vitamin C. and adjust to score but gas in addition we have ... and this of course\nAbout the hair skin and nails and of course they need college in and one of the key players just to make sure you have adequate vitamin C. every day\nSo if you can't get grapefruit orange or don't like them or feel like a switch and or you're on the road

of becoming a free radical because it's loaded with the bio lab annoyed that keep regenerating the vitamin C.\nThat's the difference between real vitamin C. and adjust to score but gas in addition we have ... and this of course has been known for centuries to be one of the most effective immune support agents for the skin whether it's in the body\nOr or outside the body so whether there's an injury or some issue that's ongoing or ... may be a really big help it's from these so if you have any\nUm allergies to them you better be very careful before you use it and of course a for those of you were concerned about losing your hair especially male pattern baldness you young guys that are starting to thin out\nYou may want to jump on her quantum greens it's loaded with old grass and ... of course is known to a bind die hydro testosterone the bad guy that usually hardens the skin on top of your head and chokes your hair bow to death\nSo a jump on this and you may see that or you don't

R. ... and want them greens\nA jump on those today you have a ... eight hundred\nThree Seventy thirty four\nHundred three Seventy [noise] thirty four forty seven All right let's go right back to the phones let's go to Stuart\nIn Elk Grove California and he's concerned about is big toes or he's got some joint pain and if it gets it's related to your a gas it are you there Stewart\nDr Marshall I'm here I'm suffering with both chose sorry ham laugh yeah and uh how old are you I'm fifty three and how much longer and a twenty four pounds okay\nAll right uh this relates to kidney function\nAnd so what we need to do is\nGive the best support the kidney and what's really going on here maybe helped a great deal by getting on some fully and said that's number one number two to a stop all red meat which you've probably already done\nAll red meat of any kind of all the fish that would have would be high\nPure marine base protein you'll have to look that up on the Web okay okay so you'd have to stop those those are particularly aggravating to the kidney okay\nNow the next thing you need to do is find out why this happened and so the odds are that this has happened either from lack of water so you need to get your water up\nTo half your weight announces show in your case about a gallon a day\nSupport to kidney and what's really going on here maybe helped a great deal by getting on some folic acid that's number one number two to a stop\nRed meat which you've probably already done\nAll red meat of any kind of all the fish that would have would be high pure marine base protein you'll have to look that up on the Web okay okay so you'd have to stop those those are particularly aggravating to the kidney okay\nNow the next thing you need to do is find out why this happened and so the
