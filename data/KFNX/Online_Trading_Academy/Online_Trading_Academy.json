you buy a home for one you ever ask a market value lost many people learned that in two thousand eight right\nMany people thought that there was no significant risk from your home and going down in value but that perception is now changed forever what about risk of property loss flood fire earthquake when storm or theft those are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment\nOther properties you might only have the same risks if you own a car a boat airplane or any other property was significant value there is a risk of loss when you own something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from\nFinancial loss\nI think you know the obvious answer here you get insurance on those assets right insurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they'll probably never use so why would you buy insurance on your home\nYou might say well I have a loan on my house so I have to buy insurance on it so that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for would you still buy insurance on your home I bet you would but why\nWhether you realize it or not\nYou'd buy insurance on your home because of something called a catastrophic risk\nCatastrophic risk means that you have any chance even if it's a small chance to lose a lot of value in other words you can lose a lot of money if something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our home is because the cost of insurance is very small compare\nThe answer here you get insurance on those assets right insurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they'll probably never use so why would you buy insurance on your home\nYou might say well I have a loan on my house so I have to buy insurance on it well that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for which is still buy insurance on your home I bet you would but why\nWhether you realize it or not you'd buy insurance on your home because of something called the catastrophic risk catastrophic risk means that\nYou have any chance even if it's a small chance to lose a lot of value in other words you could lose a lot of money if something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our home is because the cost of insurance is very small compared to the last we might incur if a catastrophic event happens\nJust for the fun of it\nLet's assume you live in a

percent in the market it takes me forty three percent again just to get back to zero\nHere's another question when does negative thirty equals zero\nAnd the answer is one year my client that's because my clients have no possibility of market losses\nSo you never have to worry about trying to regain those losses also upfront bonuses of up to ten percent when you begin your account than a guaranteed

in the market\nAll of it half of it\nDid you make a conscious decision\nTo have that particular percentage exposed to market risk or did it just sort of happened\nWhy am I asking as I said before the markets go up and the markets go down how much of your life savings that exposed to market risk\nIs a very important consideration for you that's why I strongly encourage everyone to think about their money in terms of bread money and green money those terms may sound funny but I Believe they can help us understand a very important concept and let me explain why\nRead money is money that we're willing to exposed to market risk in hopes of a higher return with red money we accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater gains\nRed money is always exposed to the upside and downside of market risk\nGreen money on the other hand is about safety and security was green money were not willing to accept the risk of losses so this money typically we're willing to accept a lower return in exchange for safety and security\nGreen money does not have downsides market risk so red money's exposed the upside and downside market risk angry money has only upside market potential which ones better\nWell that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good\nIn hopes of a higher return with red money we accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater gains red money is always exposed to the upside and downside of market risk\nGreen money on the other hand is about safety and security when green money were not willing to accept the risk of losses showed this money typically we're willing to accept a lower return in exchange for safety and security\nGreen money does not have downsides market risk\nSo red money's exposed upside and downside market risk angry money has only upside market potential which ones better well that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad\nIt all depends on your situation the very important question we should ask ourselves or these what percentage of my money should be in red money and what percentage of my money should be angry and money if you're at or near retirement you should ask yourself if any of your money should be in red money\nAre you willing to lose any of your retirement funds\nCan you afford to

mean those people who have adequate green money to guarantee that they'll always have the income they need and never outlive it and still have money left over for red money\nIf you're at or near retirement you should definitely be in the green which is money that can't be lost due to market declines many people believe that all retirement money should be green money personally I think that

lifetime income maximize or strategy that allows you to build up an income account the compounds at up to seven percent per year this account can be used to guarantee you that you'll never outlive your retirement money\nYou see when you suffer a loss in the market\nEven if it's a small loss you have three problems the lost value is just one problem the second problem is the time it takes to make back that loss\nBut the third problem is is it's almost impossible for you to regain your losses let me explain if you have a market exposed account of a hundred thousand dollars and the market drops by thirty percent your account has dropped to Seventy thousand very painful right\nBut that's just the beginning imagine the markets go back up the following year by thirty percent [noise] do you think you're back to your original hundred thousand the real answer is absolutely not now why not it's the cruel math of losses\nHere's why after dropping thirty percent the account is at Seventy thousand\nSo the thirty percent gain in the following year on the way back up again on only Seventy thousand thirty percent of Seventy thousand there's only Twenty one thousand and when you add the Twenty one to the Seventy that's left over it's only Ninety One thousand\nSo the real math is that it would take a forty three percent gain just to get back to where we started which was a hundred thousand\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the loss\nThat's why people rarely recover lost\nReal answer is absolutely not now why not it's the cruel math of losses\nHere's why after dropping thirty percent the account is at Seventy thousand\nSo the thirty percent gain in the following year on the way back up again on only Seventy thousand thirty percent of Seventy thousand there's only Twenty one thousand and when you add the Twenty one to the Seventy that's left over it's only Ninety One thousand\nSo the real math is that it would take a forty three percent gain just to get back to where we started which was a hundred thousand\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the loss\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list is is is when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero and the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes me forty three percent again just to get back to zero\nHere's another question when does negative thirty equals zero and the answer is one year my client that's because my clients have no possibility of market losses\nSo you never have to worry about trying to regain those losses also upfront bonuses of up to ten percent when you begin your account in a guaranteed lifetime income account that contractually guaranteed to grow up to seven percent per year for income purposes\nIf any of this is confusing I'll be happy to explain it to you when you call eight four four three seven one seven to three three get your customize save money
