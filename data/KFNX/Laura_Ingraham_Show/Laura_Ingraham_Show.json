this is ridiculous the uh you know Trump made one one comment and a and I I've I forget it was in response to a question which elicited this where one could be done\nYou said it would be ... have been helpful if there was a security guard in the synagogue\nThere was security guards and lots of synagogues perfectly wise recommendation\nGovernment tech by the Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh the

is out there a will kill a and a synagogue and other other centers schools should be defended but the Democrats\nThan the left are so few ranged over gun control issues that practical steps like this are hard to take\nWell I think that's the case and the former rabbi a of the synagogue a live tree of life synagogue\nWas also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset about the media really dragging this into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world view\nThis evil anti he was an anti Trump\nA fanatic that the

so greatly let's listen\nTo you welcome the president to Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president to him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of hate speech\nOr the hypocritical um words that come from him um tell me nothing\nUm we have a we have very very strong leadership and the city is believing values not just Jewish value of leaving values and those are not the value of the fact that that and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh or the current\nUh rent or you know ... forgive me for saying this but I said as the ... the Jews are out to lunch with these issues that first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked the Donald Trump ... ah you know is of counter punch it basically\nAnd he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turn\nIt on MSNBC the other day or the Cold War said the panel every single day there were four people on that\nCritical um where'd that come from him um tell me not saying\nI'm we have a we have very very strong leadership and the city is believing values not just Jewish value leaving values and and you're not the value of the fact that hats and I do not welcome him to testify or the current\nEvent that you know ... forgive me for saying this but I say this in June the Jews are out to lunch on this these issues that first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked the Donald Trump ... uh you know is a counter punch it basically\nAnd he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turn\nOn MSNBC the other day a on it and the code well set a panel\nEvery single day there were four people on the panel was the Trump it said I\nI'm a nationalist and every single one of them linked that the adults Hitler why because they were in every one of them said nationalist is dictator well actually no I chose this mess see any\nOf the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one who claim nationalism\nIs a Democrat they just won't find any pretext to link Trump to Hitler a Lawrence O'Donnell on CNBC you said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's white\nAnd then that translates into Hitler\nThey have against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny it is a tax 'em and light light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing a but these people they have dug themselves into a whole here\nAnd they they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time since Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party ads are gone to war against the legitimate Lee elected president resistance\nWhich is what Schumer and Pelosi call their up campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy\nFor political party ... we have a sister both compromise we have a system where there's a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election\nAnd that translates normally into a honeymoon that Gallup estimates is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds they were boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi\nOh who insist on demonizing the president of the United states which is something it hurts all Americans here's our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush to that quote Bush Hitler\nThe Democratic party is out of control and off the rails and or the you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that\nUntil a ... there are

are now moving toward you they're panicking on the left clearly but what what ... what one issue do you think is most important\nI think it's protecting Florida trajectory and I'm a candidate who is going to build up the success that Florida's had in terms of our economy\nAndrew Gillum wants to forty percent tax increase but I think voters know that will destroy our economic momentum I'm also a candidate that has a really solid plan to fix some of the environmental and water quality problems they look at Andrew Gillum is somebody that wants to impeach Donald Trump\nHow are you going to be able to get these problems solved with require consultation with the federal government\nOr if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done and

that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked law enforcement so I think people are looking at safe

be able to get these problems solved with require consultation with the federal government\nOr if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done

Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about\nThe allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\nSo I'm a I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for\nFor Andrew because I think folks will ah who may not otherwise one vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak\nOr when it comes to the Missouri but durable regime and Venezuela so I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses that come down\nAnd don't forget you know we have the president\nOf the United states coming down on October thirty first\nUh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida and then likely come again before the election happens and so you know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz in Texas\nUm you know that put the race away for cat that I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWell Gillum is a silver Tunde order I mean that's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about my political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric ties to he tries to do the cool thing that Obama does\nI I don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen\nMy grandmother used to say I have a dog will holler\nMiss it at Santa spoken a first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he had spoken at races conferences not calling this the defense of races I'm simply saying the race it believe he's the races\nAnd of course the our our\nLovely is over and MSNBC et cetera said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today\nOn there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boycott honors of Israel these anti Israeli organizations supporting Gillum the ... you know he's not sign this\nPledge called dream defenders I'm I planted my support to the freedom papers in the freedom papers are of course I'm also advocate textbook socialist principles the virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera\nUh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey respond\nYeah like I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous um and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody\nOf Israel these anti Israeli organizations supporting Gillum the ... you know he's not sign this\nPledge called dream defenders I'm I planted my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers are of course I'm also

supporting Gillum honey respond\nWell yeah like I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the covered his bear on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew is the one who is aligned themselves with the dream defenders they are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott divested sanction\nOf the state of Israel they actually organized boy or a flash mob protest in Israel they take special trips\nOr just the target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip and so he's way out of step on that um and I would never accept an endorsement from a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement is racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice um and that law enforcement should be defined that so that's what he said\nIn terms of the pledge he signed on that I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable or in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner and of course that's the FBI agent is part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption\nAnd turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks but when it Gillum fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nWell that's right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff\nWell then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message just showing he acknowledge that this price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton was\nActually paid for by and undercover FBI agent who he thought was a with a local real estate developer and then it comes out just a couple of days ago that that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote an almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nascent governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not\nUm disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so he goes around saying that he's not been investigator isn't being investigated\nBut I Would ask the question what other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and its palms with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating deal um that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nThe ... I only went down to some really simple in these last closing dance is just sleazy this is sleazy politics as usual bribes or people people dangling little benefits in politics\nThe developer under wrote it almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner for Guillain Nathan governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even complied with Florida law so\nGoes around saying that he's not been investigator isn't being investigated but I Would ask the question\nWhat other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and its problems with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating deal that would be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nWith ... ...

next\nFascinating race Joe Manchin of course is a Democrat incumbent senator or any supported the president here and there but overwhelmingly on the big issues still uh except for Kavanaugh we receive mansion not supporting conservative causes\nThat's led a state attorney general West Virginia Patrick Morrisey or to ah be on the verge of defeating the ... in ... but we still have a week to go he joins us now uh it's good to have you on Mr Morsi how're you\nDoing great Laurel thanks for having me on your program today\nAbsolutely a let's talk about the effort to blame the president his rhetoric his language for this horrific attack on the synagogue\n[noise] well I I think this is just another example of what we've been seeing all all you have a resistance obstruction impeachment caucus that's basically on Capitol Hill and the house and in the Senate and you have Hillary Clinton who says she's incapable of civility you have all these radicals\nThat they're only goal is to bring this press that Daryl and they're going to take the most outrageous positions whatever Trump says\nThey're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have respect for this president who has done so much to restore America the credibility aboard if you look at Israel this is a president\nAbsolutely a lot to talk about the effort to blame the president his rhetoric his language for this terrific attack on the synagogue\n[noise] well I I think this is just another example of what we've been seeing all fall you have a resistance obstruction impeachment caucus that's basically on Capitol Hill in the house and in the Senate\nAnd you have Hillary Clinton who says she's in capable of civility you have all these radicals\nThat they're only goal is to bring this president doubt as they're going to take the most outrageous positions whatever Trump says\nThey're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have respect for this president who has done so much to restore American credibility aboard if you look at Israel this is a president that it's been a staunch ally of Israel and actually had the guts\nTo go and follow through to make Jerusalem or the capital in terms of locating the embassy this was huge but\nThey will find any way to pick at President Trump\nFortunately in West Virginia President Trump has a lot of support he won the election by forty two points when\nI get elected I'm going to be a conservative fighter for President Trump's agenda and separately\nReason why people were fleeing from Joe mansion is he's another dishonest Washington liberal he's open borders he supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be as first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama years and that's why we're going to win this race\nWell why um why would they Democrat ever have much of a chance in the state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why ... is\nReally slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast that let them know what the people know that on all the issues that matter not only maps and simply stuff Hillary in Obama a match is not pro life a match and supports Planned Parenthood\nMatch and supports radical gun control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst things of all is that Joe Manchin doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said\nWe're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work so Joe mansion and the more people learn about his actual record not his rhetoric because for what he does is he says one thing in\nWest Virginia something completely different in Washington DC the more people learn about dishonest\nWashington liberal ... action they move away from 'em so it's an education process\nWhat about the um issues of just basic fairness that we saw a rise after the\nKavanaugh I'm hearing Joe Manchin a voted for cabin on the end but a man\nThat I think most people just saw that as just an example of rank unfairness and treating some time treating someone who is it 'cause he says you know they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know the Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first call on the Senate floor\nMatch and took a powder and in fact he only came back to the vote effort Susan Collins declared her position and whatever people think about the cabinet vote West Virginia's should cast a vote there should be the leadership at West Virginia so\nJoe Manchin could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nKavanaugh we know that Feinstein held that material\nI mean I think most people just saw that as just an example of rank unfairness and treating some ... treating someone who's ... says you know they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know that Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first call on the Senate floor\nMatch and took a powder and in fact he only came back to the vote effort Susan Collins declared her position or whatever people think about the cabinet vote West Virginia should cast a vote there should be leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe mansion could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nKavanaugh we know that Feinstein held that material for months why because she wanted to play politics with the Supreme Court nominee Joe mansion aided in the bed it Feinstein and Schumer by waiting giving the maneuvering room I think that's the word they used\nThat's what the problem is a guy like Joe mansion you know he may appear to be more moderate and rhetoric but in reality when you're first vote is to empower these\nRadicals then you can't be considered moderate he is a dishonest washing the liberal and more and more voters are learning that\nLet's talk about the economy in West Virginia the president decided early on that he was going to try to do what he could to reinvigorate the coal miners their way of life\nAnd yet he's ridiculed even today I Can't remember I saw it but just today for his comments about clean coal Patrick\n[noise] yeah I think many people realize that the president has really follow through on his promises to the people West Virginia let's start with coal as many people listening no I let that twenty seven state coalition\nDefeat Obama's coal killing rights at the U.S Supreme Court\nBut that that is served as a bridge to President Trump and then he follow through on his promises\nWhich were on some of those crazy unlawful rules and that's putting some miners backdoor now look we have a long way to go but you're starting to see a lot more activity in the energy area and that's directly related to the optimism people have with the Trump presidency but it goes beyond that\nThe Trump tax cuts are very beneficial for West Virginia not only a doubling of the standard deduction and the lowering of the rates but in West Virginia we have fifty five of these opportunities always which are going to allow impoverished communities to lift up and reach their potential that's\nHuge and that's credit to President Trump Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts and he\nKind of goes back and forth and say well he was open that he wasn't the reality is he voted no he voted the wrong way because Chuck Schumer wouldn't let them vote for and that's not the kind of leadership we need but we are seeing\nA resurgence in West Virginia and you have to give this president credit for so many of the good things he's done on taxes on regulatory relief on picking rule of law judges that instills confidence in the system which allows\nA entrepreneur is to spend more of their capital\nOr we are going to be covering this race very closely over the next to seven days election day next week but you can vote early in West Virginia correct\nYes in fact ah

[laughter] you're a musician right\nYeah I was a major in college and it just from there I ended up working at the company not as a performer because I have a horrific stage right but and in their um marketing department box office and then and they're bringing about Arizona and I thought the girls and teaches why would I ride\nThat first show I was like oh my gosh this is so good and I became\nA little bit addicted and you have your ... your ... so good or bad thing about how the good thing in the ... she's a she's a sick to to work by sometimes your own health detriment we have to help her a little bit let let go a little bit of her stress and pressure because she's very very valuable in this community\nAnd the arts community but also as a person and truly if you've got another question for any of that 'cause you've you've got the prosecutor tutorial mentality so please feel free to go with somebody with anything else you want to go with right okay\nWell yeah actually I had had a question for for treated because your background is is fascinating I'm curious how do we teach had built those scales who were not able to teach them to the children and there's a whole generation that we've missed with financial literacy how do I teach the legislature\n[laughter] ... I'm not a question of are really have to answer that [laughter]\nYou know a ... it's interesting you ask because I've done everything to avoid the adult audience [laughter]\nBecause you know where we're kind of said why why why have you done everything devoid but we just kind of set in our ways you know we we were just where we were right and [laughter] and you know we have our set of fixed\nCore core values and principles that we were raised by we live by and we'd practiced for many decades and so we're not a fresh in our mind that creativity has diminished not not any of you in this world but overall generally speaking\nThank you for these I mean I [laughter]\nBut I just love fresh mindset on multiple lake habits and campuses ... spring so back to the adults and I would love to teach the adults now have had audience of adults when I taught the casual cash will get like the games because games exposed behavior\nAnd is it is an active learning versus passive learning and your retention is very high when it comes to playing games such as when we play monopoly you know I was ... or any kind of game we grew up playing with the cash looking like monopoly on steroids and his real life and living in his breathing he gets a lot of ourselves and so it's good for adult adult to break down a wall that way\nQuestion are you in June partnering up on something in the future because that's something that's happening when we are going to have to bring us back for another show that's another one we\nHad a quick id actually it gets into our technology discussion oh okay yeah and it gets to really being more a collective in are buying and in our purchasing so that's where the Enron thing going on about and thinking about legacy for future generations\nAnd I have had audience of adults when I talked to cash in cash and okay I like the game because games expose behavior\nAnd is it is an active learning versus pack of learning and your retention is very high when it comes to playing games such as when we play monopoly\nYou know I was ... or any kind of game we grew up playing but the catch looking like monopoly on steroids in his real life and living in his breathing he gets a lot of ourselves and so it's good for adults adults to break down a wall that way real quick\nQuestion are you in June we're partnering up on something in the future because that's something that's happening when we are only have to bring us back for another show that's another show Louie\nAcquaintance actually it gets into our technology discussion oh okay yeah and it gets to really being more a collective in are buying and then our purchasing so that's where the ... and thinking about legacy for future generations as well\nAnd bringing in nonprofits and purchase those that are not bound by systems I mean like heavy systems that went out and you can break through\nI I I think it's a noble goal but it's like herding cats I mean I can only imagine how children this might be\nIf they're challenging you know it may not happen in my lifetime so I I recognize that I'm raising the leaders of this generation and the millennials and then once before they millennials so that this this this vision and his project in his life goal or last long after I'm no I'm no longer here and it's going to work\nI Love that positive so that was a little bit more uh of what your concept is\nIt's a significant concept of shifting the way that you use your purchasing power so that you actually get a return on your\nInvestment to pay anything you can think of that you buy when you buy it at a regular store\nNot only do you pay to go to the store but you didn't stand in line and then you have to pay them and then you pay to get back home whereas if you use a collective buying system and you begin to use technology or your everyday purchases not only do you save money on going back and forth and shopping unless you're one of those weird old they're really like to do that and\nI tell you why do I want to learn to return on investment and the and the tea that for the weirdo is there a lot of the brick and mortar shutting down you know we're thinking about that and we voted in order\nThat's the great thing about what you brought up earlier June is that it's a way for just goes to give back because he has pretty much destroyed the brick and mortar so he ... I Hope he comes back and you guys I think it's great that you I I'm hoping that you have an in so that you can maybe you\nRemind him of ... we're not here we're not anti brick and mortar in fact we have not just a an air attack and and the er and cyberspace in an online we also have a ground attack with shop local excellent with a gun ... absolutely\nLet's get back to the uh the political candidates the district Fifteen kids in terms of how again relating\nAre you guys as mothers you guys are professionals and all of a sudden the the the the conversation here with the technology and the financial how do you how do you bring that all into like a legislative experience or even a prosecutor pure prosecutorial experience how do you good relayed all that\nYeah the technology and the ground game which is what one the last few presidential election\nJulian a ... a Christian to go to come to some comments in that direction\nI think if you if you look at the federal level right now our legislature is are are clearly I'm behind the times when it comes to technology and communication online\nAnd what can be ahead of the time ... on a political ads that destroy 'cause that's where they seem to be way ahead on the way ahead on how bad they seem to be very good at that yeah\nBut I mean you see testimony in Congress where they talk about\nAgain relating are you guys whose mothers you guys are professionals and all of us on the conversation here with the technology and the financial how do you how do you bring them at all interested in like a legislative experience or even a prosecutor pure prosecutorial screwed how do you good relayed all that\nYeah the technology and the ground game which is what one the last few presidential election\nJulian a ... a Christian good comes some comments in that direction\nWell I think if you if you look at the federal level right now our legislature is are are clearly I'm behind the times when it comes to technology and communication online\nAnd what can be ahead of the time ... on a political ads that destroy\n'cause that's where they seem to be way ahead at least on the way ahead on how bad they seem to be very good at that yeah\nBut I mean you see testimony in Congress where they talk about things like Facebook and it's clear that our senators and Congress people don't understand how we communicate on line and it's you know it's an organic thing that online communication it it's not really been plan from the top down but we need people who understand how those things happen so\nHow how do we engage in that organic communication online and how do we found found those online communities and when we have representation\nAt the legislature I both at the state and national level that don't understand how those things emerged we can't get ahead of them and plan that and clearly we've had cyberattacks they don't even understand that security aspect let alone the founding of\nCommunities on line\nWhen you're running for state Senate district with my running for state Senate districts and you're probably way ahead by no issue [noise] sure\n[laughter] oh you're running for a representative state representative and district Fifteen right true story and you're weird too 'cause 'cause you know you know the you know the dollar amounts that are illegal and that was [laughter] it goes right [laughter] [laughter]\nArizona I mean it to tie it into the prosecutorial experience are going to need to do more about cyber crime and needs to be smarter about how we approach it\nBut how we approach technology is such a it's such a bigger problem at our legislature and making sure that people understand\nOne of the things that I I've been in favor for a long time\nUm and that would be one of the keys to economic prosperity in Arizona for everyone it municipal broadband what does that mean even if we need high speed Internet ad a low costs in Arizona we have it our Internet is controlled by a few providers\nWho are now free to discriminate against what content goes through those lines and we need to do more in Arizona we want to be a tech hub\nFor not only our generation but the generation of future leaders that we're raising now\nWe need somebody might remember the term net neutrality we need a net neutrality and we can legislate that on a state level as well and you see that\nHow that impact and that neutrality impacted the firefighting in California when variety than shut down and her but I you know\nAnd that neutrality and super important creating access to the Internet for low income communities because again we perpetuate this wealth gap that we talked about on the last show when we don't allow access to online resources on us I'm going\nTo have concerns about see our radio show dot com that once I started posting are shows they're going to cut it\n[laughter] I real quick I got a question of ... and I have a very short we got a short time of the segment with Nick but\nUh I mean you've heard of the show is gone [laughter] all the rights for them or shut it down\nIt's a ... it seems as if I'm ... I'm kind of stupid it was almost stuff but it seems as if the Facebook's from Twitter's get away with a lot because I'm not ... that they can say well it's not our job to screen thing is not our job to get the idiots off\nWe perpetuate the wealth out on the last show when we allow access on line ... calling us from going\nNow I have concerns about see our radio show dot com that once I started posting our show if they're going to kind of [noise]\nI I got a question I I have a very short short time in a segment ethnic but uh I mean you've\nHeard of that show is gone [laughter] All right for them that shut it down\nOr you know it seems as if I'm ... I'm kind of stupid and some of the stuff but it seems as if the facebooks and twitters get away with a lot because I'm not mistaken that if they can say well it's not our job to screen thing it's not our job to get the idiots off\nSo memorizing information doesn't help but they need to have access to it and things like net neutrality which limit their access to that information are problematic we need to have that you know couple you have\nThe access the information and you have the critical thinking skills in order to differentiate between good and bad information and right now the legislature on both levels\nIt had said well we can we can discriminate against certain sources of information so they could in theory say we're going to charge you more for the New York times or we're going to charge you more for accepting PBS's website um it doesn't have to be something like that like Netflix that could actually be a censorship censorship issue coming down the pipeline\nA and we need to make sure that we have open access that information and that we are coupling it with literacy about technology and problem solving critical thinking skills that they can evaluate what they're reading\nThat goes back to a story I told several months ago about going into a subway in the um when I made the purchase than there are gallons giving me my change back short changed me like seven cents and I said well you shortchanged me seven cents and she said no the machines\nAre or what it is [laughter]\nIn my head but I'm going to see the wrong [laughter] yeah but the machine so then I was right as long as she was very\nHesitant to believe me that what I was showing or in my hand was was wrong and she believed the machine over me\nYeah and that's why we need to fully fund our K. through twelve\nCool [laughter] very ill and rationalize is a multi billion dollar housing was seven [laughter] Joan Rivers picture [laughter]\nAnd I think along those lines to which I've been noticing about on the cell phones and Google and all that\nWhen I was young we used to have you know really good in debt debate like what are the worst of the song me really stuff but we could argue our way out of it and there'll be wrong because we didn't have the phone right there [laughter] but it is right so we need to have instead of debates about fact we need to have debates\nAbout value which I think it's sorely lacking at at our\nAt legislative let 'em\nRon [laughter] yeah but the machine so then I was right as long as she was very hesitant to believe me that what I was showing or in my hand was was wrong and she believed the machine over me\nYeah and that's why we need to fully fund our K. through twelve\nCool [laughter] [laughter] it was a multi billion dollar housing where I was seven [laughter] Joan Rivers picture [laughter]\nAnd I think along those lines to which I've been noticing about on the cell phones and Google and all that when I was young we used to have you know really good in debt debate like what are the worst of the song me really stuff but we could argue our way out of it and there'll be wrong because we didn't have the phone right there [laughter] but it is right\nSo we need to have instead of debates about fact we need to have debates about value which I think it's sorely lacking at at our\nA legislative let 'em up\nWell in part I think what can I I tried to present both sides things I think that for many years there's you know starting with\nBluntly Rush Limbaugh and talk radio many years ago there's been an opinion that there's been a liberal bias in media in politics whatever and so it's really hard to get a starting point when people are so people are suspicious of tech as being liberal bias\nBut it was especially since they're Silicon Valley San Francisco based and I think we're all blind the potential for owned biased who's so people people start with the screwed up your point of what is affecting what's liberal conservative and so I again I I go back to\nYou guys going the legislature where people don't want to necessarily find things to agree on they may win on finding things have disagree on\nSo I Know that Julie and I have talked about that is one of the things that it's important our legislature in Arizona and Republican controlled for sixty years and it's not necessarily that it's Republicans at the fact that it's one party and that there hasn't been that reaching across the aisle that really it's so important impactful and\nWe need to get to that agreement [noise] well\nYeah I mean into that and um I Lived in Chicago and I can tell you that no party has a monopoly on corruption absolutely no conflicts of interest\nTaking dirty money ah it's it's not about it it's not about whether it's a Republican thing or a democratic thing it's about unchecked power and one party not having to talk to the other party\nThe heirs of unchecked power sixty sixty and so and that's the problem it's not it isn't a party thing it's not what by your name is about do you have the ability to reach across find common ground their issues we're all concerned with Rob concerned with our kids and the education they get real concerned with the safety and security of our families\nAnd we can work together if we can identify the common values we can work together to figure out how to solve

to today ... well I'm\nAre estimated to cost us two trillion dollars over the next ten years so Mitch McConnell I don't believe really even care about the deficit or debt what he's doing is using that\nTo create a reason to go after Social Security\nMedicare and Medicaid and\nPeople need to pay very careful attention to that they've been trying to do this for years they tried to do at\nA few years ago and and Obama is a a first term and then again in his second term using a court the deficit and panicking over the deficit to get to try and persuade President Obama to sign along to\nI'm a ... so called reforms that Social Security such as chained CPI which is on refer to the consumer price index and it's like the basket of goods they used to determine how much Social Security you should get based on inflation\nSo what they do it they kind of make substitutions with the items in the CPI basket\nTo justify giving seniors last money that's one of the ways they can do it they they talk about things like means testing which sounds okay it's like well why should millionaires and billionaires get a big bigger Social Security check and you are not you or I Do right except\nThe savings gained from means testing at that level it's very little said they're gonna do means testing to get the kind of savings they would require to bring down the death and said that they created you'd have to go way further down the income scale and it would really affect a lot of people who could not afford\nTo have their their Social Security cut similarly with Medicare they talk about things like turning it into a voucher program which is basically instead of you\nHow much Social Security you should get based on inflation\nSo what they do it they kind of make substitutions with the items in the CPI basket\nTo justify giving seniors last money that's one of the ways they can do it they they talk about things like means testing which sounds okay it's like well why should

lot of people who could not afford\nTo have their their Social Security cut similarly with Medicare they talk about things like turning it into a voucher program which is basically instead of your regular Medicare that we've all grown if you're on it you're accustomed to it it works very well I'm looking forward to being on it some day they turn it into basically a coupon\nIt's very it's an order the vouchers in school it's like here's a coupon to go to a doctor it may cover forty percent you're on the hook for the rest of it Medicare covered much more doesn't cover a hundred percent of your mental medical bills but can't cover a lot of them Medicaid\nIssue affecting people of all ages but it's actually seniors\nA lot of seniors a nursing care their their final care and the last months of their lives that they you know that they need it covered by Medicaid because at that point they've exhausted their life savings and ... and step and cuts to Medicaid ... absolutely\nDevastate care to seniors as well so it's three things it's Social Security Medicare and Medicaid and Mitch McConnell and after them and the only way to stop him\nIt's to elect Democrats\nAnd the and that's ... ... absolutely effect because the simple fact is every other country in the world provide health care to all their citizens why shouldn't America viewed Rob\nRoman they're also talking about cutting back and food stamps which is particularly hits rural areas and cutting back on VA you know the the the salaries of the world claim of support VA Bush supported the idea that we have to cut back the VA because it costs too much\nMick Reilly is such a lawyers who is the worst layer I have ever seen campaigning\nAgainst held here against socialist ends against veterans and then she's got a nerve to say that she's in favor of these things she is Trump's biggest pop it in the administration she's been terrible in the house you certainly does not need to be in the Senate\nBecause I'll tell you Mitch McConnell will use her like a violin and the cut off all the services that seniors need so\nDesperately in this country we are to congressional races are going to be close Stanton encourage Patrick's and both of those two Republican candidate said they support Trump one hundred percent which means they also support cutting Medicare ... cutting Medicaid cuts in Social Security cutting the VA cutting food stamp\nAnd then further tax cuts that to justify more further cuts to adhere to a social services\nYou know and if that much ... and if McConnell were was honest with the with the American people first of all his wife has a very very cushy job working for Trump\nAnd and Trump owns him he's got 'em by the short hairs yeah quarter report is she doesn't show up work anymore she has a lot of ex well who's with us it is ... that's the\nSame story yeah she had no she's not paying any one on her staff or something I I've I it's\nVery strange I

cutting Medicaid cut his Social Security cutting the VA cutting boosting\nAnd then further tax cuts that to justify more further cuts to ... to a social services\nYou know and if that much ... and if McConnell were was honest with the with the American people first of all his wife has a very very cushy job working for Trump\nAnd and Trump owns him he's got 'em by the short hairs yeah quarter

foremost\nA as a friend I'm a fan a and I think you are for what you're doing and continue to do we're going to dive into some sort of how you got started but first we gotta go way back you got an art background brother\n[laughter] yeah I did start off in art school and a quickly realized that probably the best I could amount to is a either an art teacher or doing greeting cards\nOh wait a minute we do that our our our we've got since we have right now I'm a Palin well\nWell I I Know or I Am not saying either one of those things are a bad thing it's just that that didn't appeal to me so I decided to take sort of a left turn but stay with the New York realm\nI moved to Pittsburg and went to the artist into Pittsburgh there for a special effects makeup and industrial design ... solid learning how to make monsters\nAnd I saw some of these pictures you you you you put out a pretty good monster [laughter]\nI didn't I didn't really I didn't really have dads who much make\n[noise] yeah I did start off in art school and a quickly realized that probably the best I could amount to is a either an art teacher or doing greeting cards\nOh wait a minute we do that are only now we've got since we have right now I'm a pound and\nWell ... well I I Know are I I'm not saying either one of those things are a bad thing it's just that that didn't appeal to me so I decided to take sort of a left turn but stay with the New York realm\nI moved to Pittsburg and went to the artist into Pittsburgh there for a special effects makeup and industrial design ... so I was learning how to make monsters\nAnd I saw some of these pictures you you you you put on a pretty good monster\n[laughter]\nI didn't I didn't really I didn't really have dad too much makeup to some of those things and some of those were appliances on myself\nBut I I went to that school for a year absolutely loved it and I love the process of you know thinking of something and then bringing it into the real world that's something that very much excited me but unfortunately because the finances I wasn't able to finish school so I was sort of set adrift for a while\nAnd I had some strange job during that time I made some fake trees and\nUh you know worked at some fast food restaurants and things\nWe got Eric the car guy Eric how you are hanging with author you there yes I Am sir\nThank you brother want to thank you again for a hanging out with us and we asked the question and you had mentioned building confidence which is incredible\nIt's not so much how to but I Want to build your confidence and I know you've inspired a lot of folks to to take that on their own and have those wins in the in their garage or in their driveway about fixing their car\nOr these cars can get is you know with a ton of its platforms in that connected car and all these can control the networks that are under hood is there a point where\nYou have had in the comments section\nA particular individual that you can sort of sense that they may be going in over their head when do you cut that short and say hey best to take it in maybe have that particular electrical or any evaporative fault you know those can be complicated\nHow you handle that direction when you tell someone hey best to take it over to a professional like now that\nI'm you you can easily than that I mean if they're starting to well usually the people to throw in many many parts at it that's\nUsually where I Try to draw the line and say you know you're not really diagnosing here just sort of guessing and and using the arts cannon so that\nSo Thomas platforms and that connected car and all these can control the networks that are under hood\nIs there a point where you have had in the\nComments section a particular individual that you can sort of sense that they may be going in over their head when do you cut that short and say hey best to take it in and maybe have that particular electrical or any evaporative fault you know those can be complicated\nHow you handle that direction when you tell someone hey best to take it over to a professional like now that\nI'm you you can easily than that I mean if they're starting to well usually the people to throw in many many parts that it that's usually where I Try to draw the line and say you know you're not really diagnosing here just sort of guessing and\nAnd using the arts cannon so that's one thing and and I often discourage people from doing their own ac work also\nYeah that can be complicated we of covered in the past or ISI recharge tens or they can be dangerous and then way overboard I mean to to take a complex system like an air conditioning system and look at a gauge that is at yellow free okay I'm good you know a little more intense than just watching the gates\nSo I ... I Know complex six cents when um are they actually like painting you or they reaching out to you and saying hey what do I do not\nOh yeah all the time or either and comments or on social media\nBut I've actually tried to structure my website and such a way to where people can go there and get answers to the most popular ask questions that I've had in fact I've spent years putting those articles together with videos and things so that they can just go there and followed a trouble shooting steps that could possibly lead them to a solution\nAnd we remind you we don't want to just assume that you see in the car guy on YouTube but please visit Eric the car guide dot com\nUm that's an amazing sight there is a library of goodness there is something on that site that is related to what you may have as a need for car care and perhaps you not prone to fixing it yourself but you want to get an idea here if you do an amazing job of kind of\nYour very meticulous I think that's part of your six at um you know without knocking anybody else out there that is attempting to sort of educate on car care it truly comes down to your meticulous approach about step\nBy step and if anything if someone's not looking to fix their own stuff you know at least armed up to have a wonderful visual and asking their mechanic hey not so much that you're going to fix it the way he said but I have an idea and scope of this this is my symptoms\nThey can expect a few things that's often that you do that\nWell you know what's interesting is that because that's exactly what I set out to do I figured if people weren't going to be capable of doing the repairs nothing else that they were\nYou know given a big estimate from a shop that they would at least have some inclination of what that repair involved so they could say to themselves yeah that would be worth the money or a that guy just ripping you off or something like that so yeah that that's part of what I Do also\nOne of the things we see in the industry and in a funny ADL way I you know being the unicorn and\nNot necessarily the black sheep but the unicorn that I can be and sort of getting folks to think at a higher level in our industry folks have a tendency uh on the garage side mainly the independence of saying oh gosh here's another customer\nI found it on YouTube and when I have been barking for years to sort of quietly representing the common sense of it all is hey you need to change your approach if they were educated in a way you need to invite that and get back\nEstimate from a shop that they would at least have some inclination of what that repair involved so they could say to themselves yeah that would be worth the money or a that guy just ripping you off or something like that so yeah that that's part of what I Do also\nYeah one of the things we see in the industry and in a funny on all the way I you know being the unicorn and\nNot necessarily the black sheep but the unicorn that I can be and sort of getting folks to think at a higher level in our industry folks have a tendency or on the garage side mainly the independence of saying oh gosh here's another customer\nI founded on YouTube and when I have been barking for years to sort of quietly representing the common sense of it all is hey you need to change your approach if they were educated in a way you need to invite that and get back to the brass tacks of what's your symptom\nBecause a lot of us in the industry we have this problem that we don't know how to ask the right questions and we lose control of the very important first\nStep of well what's your symptoms you know so I just want to make you aware that you probably are and we're going to talk about some of the good works that you're doing across the industry with the future of\nA automotive mechanics and that interest or\nA ... recently you were a with universal technical Institute duty I\nA bogus one eighty autos here locally she's a rock star and of course Hubble mechanic another rock star out there educating tell us about that experience you had an opportunity to talk about your past and inspire the next generation\nFor first those two people or people that I there is some of the finest human being a planet so it was really nice to be able to to be with them but\nI you know I like the perspective we all come from you know different backgrounds have different takes on the auto industry and what it's like to live and work as a technician so it's a lot of good came out I think it was a great discussion\nYeah it was and I think it's really cool to see a movement that's happening you know years ago was shop against shopper dealer against dealer\nA mechanic against mechanic maybe not so much mechanic against mechanic but\nThere's this sense of oh well he can have it I'm going to have it and then\nAnd it's really cool the last several years to see this movement is union I think some of that with technology we we now know more a lot where there's things that are available and many of our listeners are youngsters you know who have an interest in car care\nPersonally and taking care of their ride whether you\nKnow Tyler it's addressed her they're working on the Nissan you know or they can start that way you know and they want to go to that next or\nWhat Eric they've been told uncle Louis I've been doing this since Nineteen eighty

and um\nYou know what are we going to do when they get here and the calling or fences and someone or property without ranchers they have access or houses are bars are tractors vehicles they\nYou know there's only one way to stand up against it and you know nobody's telling us what's right and wrong and basically we're going to do things the way that we still have to be\nCare of to protect ourselves and there's no concern for that\nNo American people that you are you are basically just have to suffer\nYou have to suffer for the dream of open borders so Democrats will have more

think about what these individual who would do if someone\nBreached their threshold in their own homes and whether they would ... you know welcome them in give them food shelter tell him to stay a while would they of course not welcome are loud\nThough of course not and we know the answer of Mexico when they invaded there a country is is that the assaulted police officers there well first of all we need to stop calling this a caravan of ... justice is fun comical or fraud or a car you know a circus or something like this\nThis is a mob of illegals that's all it is no no better no more no\nInvasion it's an invasion\nPrecisely and these everybody everybody is a member of Congress swore an oath to protect the United states gets all enemies foreign and domestic\nRight from the president and out every member of Congress they are a duty bound to protect this country against all enemies foreign and domestic and these these are illegal and if they cross the border than their enemies that's all there is to it and if they're not they should resign their office\nI think again the fact that we are not all hands on deck to stop this right and that I mean the president is apparently the only person willing to really cold is what it is\nWe don't violate the immigration laws of Guatemala Mexico ignore the rule of law in are about to do it in this country right\nWhat what are you better than the older they're not criminals well ... well [laughter] they have no respect for country's sovereignty or borders period\nWhich makes them criminals that de facto makes them criminals and that's why\nA gotta stop treating this as a PR disaster this is you know for a political standpoint\nThis is this matter from heaven for people like yourself myself others who are concerned about the sovereignty of this country now we've got now instead of a trick or them ... you know sneaky over under the cover of darkness or climbing fences or whatever now got an open massive

you go to a port of entry and you're saying I claim asylum then we'll have to process them into the country then we do not bad for them so we relate some most of them don't show up that's it but\nI but I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political oppression is that these people are not politically oppressed this there's no such thing as economic asylum only political asylum and so if you come here for the goodies for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just come here to to\nTo you know to you know pond yourself up on society without giving anything back with these people a word water to their own country anyway but the fact is is that they

there are private they're private schools\nAnd there's nothing to do with skin color where you come from ... has everything to do with the fact that this becomes a burden on the system if you don't have an orderly process of immigration puree like in and it's it's just absurd let's let's um I Wonder\nIf that's the other thing Trump needs to ram home and the Republican Party and anybody concerned about the rule laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go to the process\nI Know they don't want to do that and I said well I

for the worse fifty one percent of voters are said they want their congressional candidate to talk about immigration\nA lot that's fascinating\nLess than ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration and to the United states as opposed to eighty one percent of voters who support curbing immigration levels\nThat's a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this year a stunning thirty five percent said the level should be fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand a year that's a quarter of what we allow in legally now\nNineteen percent said it should be two hundred and fifty thousand\nFive hundred thousand combined that makes them a majority at least fifty percent or they want to cut of oh at least fifty percent to current annual levels of immigration\nJust Nineteen percent of respondents said they want an increase over the current one million people they allow into the country legally the most people just don't know most people you know in the country

community we have a lot more to get to coming up Marsha Blackburn going to join us [noise]\nOdd because you know if this is happening any of our homes would expect that they were being arrested in and taken to jail for breaking and entering but now we have thousands of people most of them able bodied men who just say look we don't care about the sovereignty of Mexico or Guatemala or the United states were coming in what\nIs your view on this\nYou know are there is a right way and a wrong way to do just about everything and there is a great way to come to this country and there is a long way and they are going about is a long way if they want to see political asylum there is a process for doing that and we know\nThat it is important that we defend our southern border and when you talk to all of our border patrol agents say talk about the necessity\nOf doing that and I think it's in theory is that we\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexico to make certain that they're border is secure into the air protecting their sovereignty book cause\nThis is not something that you know people entering by force is not something that we should\nView as being unacceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo opponents who's very steep do this you know take no prisoners very partisan way of looking at the world people were pretty good at it and I just tell people that were too was I'm not for God\nGo to other choice [noise] um do you want to move things forward makes compromise is try to give some solutions for immigration healthcare and all these big issues with it for one of them would be real pleased\nMexico to make certain that they're border is secure into the air protecting their sovereignty book cause this is not something that you know people entering by force is not something that we should\nView as being an acceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's

guys [noise]\nChoice [noise] um do you want to move things forward makes compromise is trying to get some changes for immigration healthcare and all these big issues with us with one of them would be real pleased people's issue one more time\nOh here's the had eight years of Obama what did they did they must have our healthcare system and we did catch and release so what is he talking about\nWell you know this is this is going to be language that you hear from liberals when they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most bipartisan\nRecord of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continued to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\nFace family freedom posts an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's sovereignty and protecting our borders securing the southern border\nWas in my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor he gave Valley State issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one thousand illegal aliens he they tend to senior high button\nFor illegal aliens and our general was simply stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but yes it's the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater\nI fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he joins them those certificates and I believe we need to indulge sanctuary city policy I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think so brightest somebody there at the border welcoming download giving them\nA state issued id and of course we\nKnow the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes\nOpen up our borders so\nI'd say life stand firm on this ... certain this heath care of and now they cannot just come walking into our country and receiving benefits Tennesseans want to see us to deal with the gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human

McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally livid about this there's no reason this mobile mob should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall\nWell you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get to send it to take that up and that is a good place to start and to remind people is that is in executive Menlo program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so putting a that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing that southern border you know large you realize\nWalls work anybody that doubts that don't talk to Israel walls work and what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat ought not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met with say an angel on the other day and Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by illegal aliens who had had several\nRun ins with law enforcement and of course\nHer daughter is she did she is retiring this grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico and this is not\nIt's it's not right

certain things and he's done them\nIncluding on trade and all the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\nHe they have a ... I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade meaning people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a congresswoman Blackburn and and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focused\nTax cuts take on China get more manufacturing it home and it's working\nWell it is working\nAnd I'm not a fan of tariffs I like free and fair trade and in West Tennessee where I Am right now or our farmers our soybean farmers are incredibly concerned about what he's going to end up happening with China but here's the thing China has had a trade war on us for decades\nSo Congress how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\nThat's right and so what they will say is if we're in a war we got to be sure we win this war\nAnd that is what they want to do and they want to make

who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expected administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given but\nThey can pay back once they work in the United states who are very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor at this is another and said that the game you went back you verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory e verify that's the key is the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to catch that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so do a good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum from Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is not the case if that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we are talking to you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states under

roofing that's more of a young person's job but you know what I'm Talking about the idea that America has to import uh foreign workers to do every American job is lunacy\nI when I grew up we didn't need that probably didn't have that problem when I when I was growing up American did all sorts of jobs Trump picking a tobacco which my brother did to picking fruit which I did\nWho I mean all of us did all of this work in yeah if you have to pay more to get Americans to do these jobs good you should pay more I told you when I was in Switzerland it was really interesting to talk to the Swiss

as far as the order but at the you know an American citizen here I I don't want to just think that this voting is going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the voter has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we are going to better do it here and he's got to ... and if it's a national emergency the president has extraordinary powers\nAnd drugs guns\nOr criminal element or gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population who are only coming into the United states to hook up again contacts we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands that they this president gets this like no one else how many have you saw the frightening the frightening display last night on the ... it was called meet the chairman you remember that movie made the parents\nSo it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you can imagine is what's\nGoing to happen to the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee if the Democrats have their way five five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\n[laughter]\nI Believe that the easiest and quick solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the federal I Am for rounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of\nUh being able to get into the home studying act you could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever\nAnd with the uh that's already covered the priority on any old studying at the open up your could wind up with a lot of our vets in the whole study which would be helping all the American and at the same time\nPut one hell of a wall down there\nAh another interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman and Democrats just want an open border open borders open

F. and acts currently ranked in the top ten by ranking Arizona listen to what's worldwide and eleven hundred JFK ...\nOr indication that you know we've lost our way and you I Can't even blame illegal immigrants I mean I Can't even blame them because we did this to ourselves other countries don't do this we we did this to ourselves but now it's got to stop\nJoining us now Michael ... of course former Trump campaign advisor Republican political strategist he's involved in some of the key races\nIn New York he also had a great a podcast called still standing radio dot com to just go there are still standing radio dot com\nAnd you can listen to Michael who has a finger on the pulse of what's happening in these midterm cycle Michael it's great to talk to you I think the Democrats made a huge miscalculation and embracing these caravans of people who want to storm the border I think most people from all walks of life life across this country fine now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that ... a prime time last night do Cortez as a warrior oh yeah we're here for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino and his president or his parents\nCame here legally and he in doors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I worked as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats summer the death threats I'm certain ... gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and your um ... or ... the Democrat signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools they're just out in the country and they're working and that like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much on to this president leadership\nThe president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I what Steve as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of them death threats I'm certain schemes gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him\nAnd you're right um the or the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much on to this president leadership and then on the other side they see chaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism\nOr embracing the illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders it it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop that this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nAnd to learn the now with ... coming toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington back during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and it\nWas people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump and have backbone\nAnd would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nYou saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh rethought spines grow in senators we didn't even think Adam anymore we Lindsey Graham was a hero chairman Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today\nBut it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health a radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done in the last few years on immigration are shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people a year and a lot\nOr or to be decrease so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain a saying that the Gallup poll from June I'm thirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty\nNine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration and that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doormat\nThe difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health a radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done in the last few years on immigration shows that most people

immigration and that those are the convenience factor\nThe inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration doesn't affecting your life\nYour kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work or in a different school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrants for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less\nSo you know people don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's a very blue collar area and a ... year a year or so we've seen you know truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested at a seven eleven on their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen\nA chain of Mexican restaurants\nAnd uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them cash on he just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell you in western New York\nIn Buffalo where we used to be a strong steel worker town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here me these jobs need these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats in the mainstream media spend their time trying to\nGas light them on this issue talking about how important\nAre ... immigration is to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're\nConflate against illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration is against illegal immigration\nAnd I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process the first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nKnow and the problem she sees is it from people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now over ... etc\nIt's an it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly ... it's you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own government and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they ... it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but\nLook the cats at the at the border is is not ...\nIt's really worth it you know and the problem she sees is it the surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here

the streets in the ... and the aftermath of Kavanaugh\nAre and the Democrats prefer that because if there's chaos you need more government\nGovernment grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier\nThan when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long\nConfirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh the screaming in the hearings the the uh the people running down the uh the always the basement of the United states Capitol screaming at senators the the people trapping senators\nAn elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras\nThe mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed the people trying to literally ... with their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building if they like that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or\nIf the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans wouldn't lose the house because\nA lot of people who were not measure well by the polls and twenty sixteen they call us deplorable right that people who hadn't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all\nThey found a champion and Donald Trump someone they fought a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit

the country one of them is Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where Marty\nNo Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat lefty Susan Wild\nAnd this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty as the person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also it's an avid cyclist within the two thousand uh Olympics as attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy\nImmigration trade all the rest are Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues are the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nHi Laura first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district Pennsylvania seventh district has everything from the urban core of Allentown Beth I'm an east into the cause\nOf farming communities in the northern tier worked district what we call this late built a region ... what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our president's been able to accomplish\nWe're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know other rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now a lot of votes\nIt's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest are Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues are the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nHi Laura first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district Pennsylvania seventh district has everything from the urban corps of Allentown Beth I'm an east into the\nTo the farming communities in the northern tier work district what we call this late built a region you know what we're what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our presents been able to accomplish\nWe're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know other rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now a lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake\nIf they flip the house on a ... in in Congress\nWhat what uh when when you see the redistricting that but obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what it's traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to are trying to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration where we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth\nPeople don't like this chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nYeah I think that's really on a lot of people's\nMinds is just the the radical a resistance we're seeing from the left a\nRash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen\nUm most people I'm Talking to I Would say the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform or we need to secure our southern border a and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive that\nI'm so immigration appear in Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that's it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because the me too movement the woman's march and so forth are so ... what would they try to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nWell that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her\nPrimary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move to the center but um her results speak for themselves or you know she she's she's radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy and\nBureaucracy no for an pitching the president in teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any of her commercials she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's what she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen Marty\nWhen I see the uh the amazing economic growth that's been made possible by this president's focused uniquely\nOn the American worker the American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line and the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks and smashing car windows and\nBorders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy in Iraq or see no for impeaching the president and teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's where she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's where she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth has been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American worker the American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI've been watching some of your campaign commercials in advance on line and the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks and smashing car windows and\nIn a in raising the flags of other countries in America they want America to be a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I\nThink it's job not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that\nThe results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up in ... uh we we announced a campaign um our our\nBrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows\nYou know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in the seventh district which in my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what\nYou're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is it is it's it's really\nQuite alarming and funded funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty not seen a ... I Can't wait to see you in Congress\nYou know it's\nWell it's all money it's your money at your country and in California I remember what they voted for or they are they're supporting and signed into law free health care for everyone including illegal immigrants in California where do you think that's going to do to the country it's already happening now\nIt's already happening federal services to

of it it's a it\nYou know it's\nWell it's all money it's your money at your country and in California I remember what they voted for they are they're supporting and signed into law free health care

soaring across the United states\nBecause of corrupt judges court cases creating writes in the constitution and creating right to this the right to that birthright citizenship\nAll of it it's a it has fundamentally already transformed entire states in the country or the commonwealth of Virginia this was a conservative blue collar military a lot of veterans and now if if\nBarbara Comstock loses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind them is a congressional race reelection\nShe loses I saw something on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies follow always liberal policies always follow wear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the\nAh African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll will tell us that\nImmigration is adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has so I'll give you that a stat just a moment a doctor my Christian is with us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni who converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd he's been following the media and their use of manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a Saturday counsel at the Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post\nOr is or was murdered and apparently it's all Donald Trump's falls Dr Christian good to have you with us or what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're you know it affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me editor for the ship the local community and and you're right when you have a party that is owned by by them and ah ah you know those old uh guards it's it looks like they are often from inside\nWhen I I think actually this um you know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we're not going to get the truth out there and the reason of that has this when you know many people that she doesn't understand you know this ... between the states and Saudi Arabia and try to point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the ... and\nAnd also to dictators and so forth which is far from through if you listened to Trump in his last quarter on his before this incident look out\nThe embarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times\nThat was a big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East so uh when we look at this ends and then I think people need to understand that Trump is not I'm backing up the salad is because he loves loves the dictates of his off workers\nTo the reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we're not going to get the truth out and and the reason of that has this when you know many people actually don't understand you know the situation between the United states and Saudi Arabia and try to a point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the ... and\nAnd also to dictators and so forth which is far from too if you listened to Trump in his last quarter August before this incident broke out\nThe embarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and\nThat was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East\nSo uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nI'm backing up the Saudis because he loves the loves the dictates of his old for personal gain because this is nonsense he's doing this because the Saudi Government the current government is doing a good work that helps them not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from bite and then Obama and all of those previous\nPresident with a lot states and why I'm saying that because you when you look at what the current um gum prince and the Saudi Government is doing\nTheir head thinking many fronts your number one is the other hand I think by defending the Islamic movement by looking in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all they are fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they\nAre helping the states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east there hunting big time they get on the Iranian sanctions are and how the Trump is putting those on\nBy living oil prices and and on all the stuff also the current administration or kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty that never ever be imagined before and Donald Trump is about announced that are very very soon\nWhat is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's an Egypt and Israel which is gonna be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years\nSo Donald Trump is supporting\nUm you know the government\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those reasons alone and all of those\nHead for the United states not that dictatorship and ... plus adding to all of this we believe in this country that everybody's innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to\nFollow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know I I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the states but still ... over there and my ... in my home brew which you\nKnow nothing happens by coincidence\nWhen uh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time after the Trump Administration embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the\nThe faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nWell I think again mark ... America\nIn ... in the American voters if they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the ... which again it's it's the it's so sad and it's so predictable\nThey always go to racism they always go to Nina phobia they this is all they have it it's women are oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ... I mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about the meanwhile\nRation embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point well I think again mark ... America\nAnd ... and the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the which again it's it's the it's so sad and it's so predictable\nThey always go to racism they always go to a phobia they this is all they have it it's women are oppressed and the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ...\nI mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about but meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people who are about to cross into America unless we do something about the thousands and thousands of people many of them this is an adult men or\nYoung military age men who are have joined this caravan and are being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally that is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and\nIt's outrageous and Americans have to stand against it total all it's not a die hard and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas which is why they always go to this year's men and all the kinds of ideas that they talk about that means ...\nBut when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats but goes for Donald Trump and an historic away and then right after that they start talking about the current events\nMarching to the board that of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the Hispanic\nVotes jump into the vote a boost and try to vote for them so this is a very well organized by the media and I have no idea how they do it\nBut I have no doubt that everything is it the night you pay attention to the states they talk about it for three days how the Hispanic vote in Fort Drum in a historical way and then all of a sudden\nWe have an ... you know a problem on the on the border and then we have to figure this out and do know Trump's days we're not going to let that happen and I think Hispanic votes watery and Americans can see through this because\nI trusted that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that they'll give you that you have you're not going to be deceived by the uh the Biddy filthy or works of the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nWhere we have to make alliances with people in in in countries that now you know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that and don't keep your eye on the ball people because what mark said is exactly right this is calculated\nAnd and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this\nDo you have you're not going to receive the by the uh the bidding filthy or works of the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian or you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nOr where we have to make alliances with people in in in countries that now you know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that\nAnd don't keep your eye on the ball people because what marks that is exactly right this is calculated and and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated strategy get Donald Trump out there on the immigration issue and think that because he talks about it Hispanic voters will start\nTurning out on mosques against him and the Republican Party eight five five forty Laura the Laura Ingraham\nShow telling it like it is independent eleven hundred KFI [noise]\n... when it comes to crime cinema putting in some ... to ...

two days later I'm found him he basically told them that are ... the ... the deputy asked them whether or not I said or did anything to provoke him and his answer was no\n... the deputy asked them did you give them any warning prior that you were going to hit him his answer was no and then the deputy asked him do you know where you hit him and he said yeah right and right now\nSo is he arrested for

charge or waiting for the medical report as well as the video surveillance\nAnd you're obviously going to testify against him you've already given ...\nYeah they came out they took pictures of the the bruises on my body and um my eyes which was you know the white um my I was like had to I don't know was all red mhm and uh now now it's the concussion side I've learned that the sun is not my friend\nOh my goodness Shane would any down with the ... sorry go ahead and\nBought the bigger thing is that what I mean the there's the disability seems to be gone and and I mean\nI I didn't get the sense that we weren't uh like minded going into it I guess are up until that point but it's just\nYou know wail somebody in the head and send them flying is as I said before it's not something I was signing up for\nWell Shane a first of all the left is trying to intimidate\nGood Americans like you from running for office\nThey're trying to frighten people scare them and if that doesn't work physically attacked them out of a race physically prevent you from running\nAnd this is being encouraged by the Democrats at the highest levels\nEven those who claim over not for violence of course we're not for violence than ... where are they why are they supporting this caravan approaching the U.S border that is lawlessness complete and utter lawlessness they embrace lawlessness if the ends are in their minds justified noble\nSo that means are justified excuse me at the end is noble in the end is electing Democrats or you can bring more of a a social spending framework voice that on the American people\nOf all the goals of of of more of a democratic socialist approach to governance\nIf those are noble goals and you can get there by any means necessary including a sucker punch of someone that gives them a concussion and messes up there by a and this is why conservatives Republicans of all backgrounds you must ensure that these people are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the

I really don't um I I I I've heard a few things that I'm a I guess there's some he's in the trades of some sort of as what I learned but beyond that I don't really know much about him ... I just knowing that occurred early big guy to be on that we\nHave Democrats are in the state spoken out against us\nYou know I I actually know so like both of our senators are Democrats\nBy any means necessary including a sucker punch of someone that gives them a concussion and messes up there by\nA and this is why conservatives Republicans of all backgrounds you must ensure that these people are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law I Would file a civil suit against him a and I would I Would I Would move on that stuff I Would sue him for what he did\nAnd I hope you I Hope you do that you know anything about his background\nI really don't um I I I've heard a few things since the\nI guess there's some he's in the trades of some sort that is what I've learned but beyond that I don't really know much about him ... I just knowing what occurred only big guy to be on that we\nHave Democrats are in the state spoken out against this\nYou know I I actually know so like both of our senators are Democrats and neither one of them to my knowledge as of yesterday anyway\nHad come out and publicly denounced it um [noise] I Will say that my congressman or Tom Emmer he did call me a soon as you heard about it was the first time he's ever call me but it and you know give me as a condolence to the support and all that I was you know but but\nOther than ... nope none of none of our representation or higher up people have come out and said that to the to the last I looked anyway imagine if\nYou were to be the ... the the thing that is the norm now it just you know go out and like you said getting their faith kick them when they're down whatever the comments or I got tore up for using that exact lining up Facebook response\nOf calling out the comments from Hillary and Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and and if somebody actually spend the local publication as my understanding that how would how would their their comments have any influence in rural Minnesota I don't know if they don't think we don't have a radio and TV out here\nWas [laughter] yeah so Eric Holder if they go low we can't come Hillary Clinton if they go low we hit harder or whatever it is she said ah right yeah well and of course it doesn't affect\nI mean I don't know about this guy I don't know what his deal is but of course it has an effect and it's meant to intimidate it is a type of political intimidation and its physical intimidation and up to the point of committing crimes\nBut again they they they attempt to dehumanize entire groups of people like if you're a conservative in Minnesota and you run for office and you and you call it as it is they have to call you a racist you they have to say that you're anti women\nAre and you might imagine what they would have done Shane if a a liberal female Muslim candidate for instance uh was brutalized or hit by someone else a woman as let's say a concert or just give the gender that\nA conservative woman hitter said you don't you're not you're not representing my interests you imagine\nAnd I wouldn't mind your first one to ... I'd be the first one out there to condemn that physical absolutely tax\nWell I can say I certainly wouldn't wish this upon anybody I don't know and and and I you know I grew up my mom was extremely liberal my entire life my dad was a polio opposite very conservative they were thought about it\nIn fact they they they would tease each other you know let's go Catholic vote I mean it's I guess the the this doesn't need to be everybody's everything where if you don't agree with me I it's it's all out just throw it out and\nBattles it says\nIt's a it's a sad place when we become actually\nA shame how does your race look\nAh in theory I'm going to Seventy thirty district so conservative speaking so it's a it's a strong Republican district or with the unfortunate part is we do have an independent that sought the GOP endorsement and ran as an independent\nOne out there to condemn that physical absolutely tax\nWell I could say I certainly wouldn't wish this upon anybody I don't know and and and you know I grew up my mom was extremely liberal my entire life my dad was a totally opposite very conservative they were thought about it\nIn fact that they would tease each other you know let's go Catholic voters vote I mean it's I guess it ... this doesn't need to be everybody's everything where if you don't agree with me I it's it's all out just throw it out and\nBattles it says\nIt's a sad place when we become actually\nA shame how does your race look\nAh in theory I'm going to Seventy thirty district so conservative speaking so it's a it's a strong Republican district that with the unfortunate part is we do have an independent that sought the GOP endorsement and ran as an independent but\nSide from that the the downside to this is a I ... the doctors have told me or you got to lay low you have no idea what this is I Try to tell them I only have three weeks a campaign left and I ... I went out and get a new banked on Tuesday I paid dearly board yesterday so weighing low is probably the more important thing right now\nWell you got to get surrogates out there for you you got to get friends in surrogates out they're few and events because you've got to win the seat you got to win the house seat um 'cause I Know that's that's a must so you got to get friends out there to help you what's your website chain\nUh Shane back when dot com and neck limited spelled M.
