MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene Brazil has elected a new president John ... and our own and he is from the far right [noise]\n\nWere celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro the continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain failed to victory in yesterday's runoff election who will take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves who was reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for\nThe both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they ... the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why both now defeated the workers' party candidate for NATO and Daschle so comprehensively\nI should say though that both NATO himself insists the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted and afterwards he read out part of the constitution to reporters\nThe need for the future presidents who respects to judge had to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they say is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's essential issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt\nFor example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as ...\nI don't believe that I think he really but\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime is as you said that he had a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high ... yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both

thing the answers to bad speech or hate speech however you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhen does online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light the demand\nGab follows strict rules including no threat he said he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nFor there are thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who may uh now seaport Donald Trump or they allow hate to be spewed at certain groups and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line as we are free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says poor by is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional famers intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible with their speech she says last year Google band gaps up apple rejected and Microsoft terminated its agreement with it last month just in the last twenty four hours at least two\nThat gap condemns the

lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin\nTest [noise] uh yeah [laughter] you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test out of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so\nForty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also inexpensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital system\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in that position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty\nSo I think we have to look nationally for references Dr

the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can redrawing here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil or almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they ... for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why both now defeated the cars party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nHad to remind him and the people that people ... about the constitution and what it's\nDon't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home Andrea\nIsraeli on as it's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe that I think he really but dye\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime is as you said that he has a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David are sick of robberies and the sky high ... yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio\nPeople are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks\nYou're welcome\nNow we have more of a social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he reportedly used gab which calls itself an alternative

interview with NPR he defended the platform I don't know you direct\nThat what you're proposing here well I run into problems and here's the thing the answers the bad speech or hate speech however you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhen does online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the men accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats and the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threat he says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWho were there are thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who may uh now support Donald Trump or they allow hate to be viewed at certain groups and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line is we're free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies\nReally what our constitutional frame or intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible with their speech she says last year Google band ... up apple rejected it and Microsoft terminated its agreement with that last month just in the last twenty four hours at least two Web hosting platforms have suspended gab\nCEO
