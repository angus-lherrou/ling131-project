Idaho dot com [noise]\n\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we did it one of those things where we're going to have to walk this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final vote which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural do today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning\nKelsey I you know I Wonder if you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and\nAnd what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and then all of this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up which isn't ... not no\nJust become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about in American politics for the past year or so\nThey seem to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they pass an essay but they'll they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting to the basics of government on pushing it if they can continue to do that or if these fights towers them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other colleagues Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington ... so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of this for re have Grassley I think a Dianne Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nAnd we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time living on the Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more a before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley\nRight now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein\nBefore sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said she was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have gone I Know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamic heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will that last remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years and somebody pointed out that anonymous uh op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nSo I remember I remember that I remember something in the past about that yeah\nYou know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people the\nMe on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be hurt let's\nGo back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nSexual assault even under the lowest standard approve she concluded quote\nA he said she said case is incredibly difficult to brew but this case is even worse than that Dr Ford identify other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to wreak\nCorroborate them for the reasons discuss below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy their preponderance of evidence standard end quote\nWe have thoroughly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background in addition to the prior six FBI fall feel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who have known judge Kavanaugh his entire life\n[noise] have work night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members\nThe FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week the FBI interview ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirmed\nWhat we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by a judge Kavanaugh and these are the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI\nCould locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations there also is no contemporary\nContemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service nothing and investigator including career FBI special agents\nDoes ever be good\nTo judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominate there is simply no reason then\nTo the judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us the Democratic strategy used against judge Kavanaugh has made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair and ... the process is\nThirty one years ago\nThe Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork\nTheir playbook remains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become\nTo Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote\nOn the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not would probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening\nA comparison I'm Robert ... nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated and there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how Bork fared\nAnd the fact is that ... into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal interest did have some ads against him and they were chump change compared to where the money to spend today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes of the main um but\n... views it turned out he answered the questions quite forthrightly like I did have very strong and he had very strong views and quite as it turned out in the view of many Americans and their senators extreme views on this\nCase Kavanaugh has pulled his punches quite deliberately not quite said with his food\nGoes actually correct so for for example said he's sticking to his you that the one person one vote decision was wrong Kavanaugh or would not really express his views on almost anything he he would always say that Supreme\nBecause Charles ... screech now Dianne Feinstein the equivalent Democrat on the church of it has been done her remarks was his last summer they\nWere over Ninety percent of his record has been hidden from the public and the Senate\nNever before have we had a nominee display such flagrant partisanship and open hostility at a hearing\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurt all the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those and just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in your covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially\nSounds like if there is for key votes this is going to be close they're going to get forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most ah let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she's delivering her closing argument let's listen to her [noise]\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear in their entirety over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote it was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch\nThrough and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell and the next few minutes needle Totenberg is with us here and you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what you'd call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their side\nUh but don't be fooled by their\nBoring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist\nHe has done amazing things for a matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the court or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated was a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budget they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nI you know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but\nHe is there a guy he's the appointment he's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can do let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR News\nWell Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young [noise] ah there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away\nOr they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual faults in actual trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot put a Supreme Court you cannot elevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such crime\nRight there have been found and what what they're saying she had said one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days as well we'll talk talk about that a little bit more on mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nStored in chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nWith poison from the outset\nWhen President Trump was elected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom a list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest as ... concerned compared to repealing roe v Wade\nWhen the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public\nJust guarding decades of bipartisan precedent and warning norms of trends parents the end of fairness\nAnd finally the dam broke under the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn twenty Eighteen the Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings in Nineteen Ninety One\nLook fair by comparison in this hearing\nThere were no corroborating witnesses on either side no independent investigation of the fact to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford\nOn trial [noise] only at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nAn investigation which was then severely dark ...\nNothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay\nKnowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control of when nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks ago\nOr one week ago Democrats had nothing no day and don't when it comes to who come to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats for moving forward when it comes to complaining about the link\nTo word never come\nFrom our Republican friends lip Merrick Garland Republicans are all those thing we engaged in quote a smear campaign or the politics the personal destruction\nWas his nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said Democrats did not end do sort of come forward\nHer conscience there\nOf a mere campaign are they choosing doctor for the smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee\nThey don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no less than from the Senate's conduct here let them look back on this chapter\nHas the shameful combination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America people who will stop at nothing to entrench an advantage on our nation's courts\nFlip the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh\nBe recorded as a story epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many years and a bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh\nCertainly a product of an elite education\nBut also someone with hard right\nConservative jurisprudence far far away from what average Americans believe why most Democrats oppose this nomination at the outset\nFields like ancient history now but let's not forget that most importantly we strongly disagree\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEveryone is innocent until proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob and communication are valid tactics for shaping the Senate\nThe mob can attack\nThe liberation will still define\nWill either give notice\nIt totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy on American flight\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so low so\nMadam president today is a pivotal day in the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long for all unfold as for\nThe last step back and sample a few of the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announcers the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare the nominees would pave the way to turn\nHis audience\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great moral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against a more recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nHe deserve less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nWe disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nGot due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great coughing offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties that was incredibly enlightened\nPositive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings\nUntil of course a number of judge Kavanaugh's last night said 'em straight earlier this week\nShe'll stop and consider the snap shots the absurdity the absurdity the indebtedness say this\nIs our approach to confirming a Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse [noise]\nThe end here dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process would be about the way obstruct and ... and before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are totally opposes confirmation ... hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president\nA clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing could get most Democrats consider this nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction\nAnd so called resistance until the final vote was called\nFor a few weeks there are parts played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for delays those fell flat there were gross distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside factor at first\nAnd there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice at every time\nPossibly one\nHospital the vulnerable people hospital workers same old trucks so I'm all by boat but here's the problem they all players weren't working the distortions were being\nThe judge Kavanaugh's nomination that for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus a pen which\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses Raul stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character\nNothing like the character\nSo it was clear mind president the old taxes weren't working wasn't going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen\nAnd a political weapon\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd to the press\nChairman Grassley admittedly set out\nFBI background investigation judge Kavanaugh's seventh\nSeventh FBI investigation\nBy any parents that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence not not\nWas producers support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiry\nOr from anywhere else nothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they've been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats moves the goal posts yet again\nBelieve the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this\nBecause individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again the latest\nAbout nearly forty year old allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses\nNever mind that they didn't actually witnessed anything\nThey didn't want to say anything\nSo let's\nBe clear madam president these are not witnesses these are people supposedly in possession of here say they'll say first heard thirty five years after the suppose\nWhat nonsense [noise]\nThey're ... very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense that sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely aren't even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things kind of do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the ...\nDebate after another for close to two\nDecades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move for Mitch McConnell yes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain catch that traumatic thumbs down vote\nYeah on the repeal of Obamacare this would be the combination\nFor Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime really of campaigning for changed federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as they go through the roles are killers\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia has a no vote ... Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senator\nSenator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're on a knife edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise with ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has of Delaware in ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week they'll lay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate\nHas only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and the rooms that are needed in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote NPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this\nAdvanced is a nomination or that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench in a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process has generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering the relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only at ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia who we were just talking about has now voted aye\nThat's right Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is key procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe Manchin isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state this cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of his state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat\nAnd he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nWho's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us this vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears\nHe's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program [noise] Hey Steve could be with him so what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\n[noise] well it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the mid term midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base\nThat frankly you know I think it was looking for something\nTo get them to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap as a lot of the service has shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh on to have a when I think is just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters as\nBecause when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up then the people that are kind of fat and happy\nBut now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to to succeed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down because yes\nI'm Alex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you term did for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWhile I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee\nThe new Supreme Court session so I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there and definitely while the character assassination continues and then yes I Do think part of it is the the political factor\nWhich is there's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put another Trump appointee and others solid\nA judge on the Supreme Court\nThat is a great deliverable for for our base just like tax reform us a good deliverable for our base I think we're you're you're a Republican voter who has mixed feelings about Trump's personality as frankly I Do you look at these results over the last few years between tax reform", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)",
