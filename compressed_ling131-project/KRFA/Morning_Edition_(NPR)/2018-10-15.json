hundred Eighteen Eighteen\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need to drink bourbon whiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection\nWhich President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday we visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric ...\nThe same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky sits on the limestone shelf ... filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon dj about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ... years you're you probably are global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ... from the\n... but yet they I Would say they're international sales are starting to outpaced their domestic sales in the past Fifteen or Twenty years the global markets really increased ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well an apt to any you agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time\nWhat does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nUh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people did you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back\nA which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid in the obvious as the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why would we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh uh come up as an issue yet you made an issue like at election yeah it has to come up I mean\nCongressman Barr has been very helpful to us and the past few months he said the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon me\nWith this issue to mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that that's a federal law right\nIs a federal in Nineteen sixty four Congress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith bourbon you've got to make it here in America if he wants to sell you better makes in Kentucky [noise] beginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been\nA I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and this from a standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose them for generations ferret\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nWe turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael which hit Florida Panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable road than non functional phone and made life difficult for residents and rescue team and for insurance adjuster\nHomeowners insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone signal near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor the situation like that we're relying on aerial shots that aside or look at it if you're going on\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas of lost a generational term ... old tree farms are hit pretty hard and the car industry is just devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster with alpha insurance and Alabama he's been working in Houston county\nGod was ready to be picked last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred miles per hour winds just blows it a lot less people source of income or so lovely could\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says that insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry is quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so we had some good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are\nLike everything back to normal obviously that's not going to happen or you know when you're you're talking to people that houses have destroyed all their belongings showed her pictures there's no amount of money is going to get an image back of your of your parents that are passed away so your child first birthday\nWhile some things

will tell you he saw something and Donald Trump early on that made him believe Trump could win the presidency\nAnd that's something Gingrich saw has a lot to do with how he sees himself the former speaker of the house made a name for himself by breaking a lot of political norms and refusing to compromise with the other side\nMuch like President Trump the Atlantic magazine McKay coffins spent some time with Newt Gingrich recently for a profile he did it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome the cake topping is in our studio this morning thanks for coming in thanks for having me\nSo you went to spend some time with Newt Gingrich and he suggested it suggested that you do still at the Philadelphia is due\n[laughter] that's all right how come well he is a famous uh animal lover he's you know donated to ... around the world who he loves animals but I think also what became clear to me as I got there\nIs that she sees animals as useful metaphor is for him as we were kind of touring the zoo he was you know pointing out the lions and saying you know this is what the lions teach us about gender politics and this is what a crocodiles teach us about uh about the way that we should\nAggressive they are and you know I said I didn't really know what to say so I said you know oh there's the viciousness of the animal world and you kind of cut me off and was very stern and said it's not vicious it's natural right and and I think that he draws those parallels with how he abused politics and how we view human affairs in general\nAnd he like in some self to other conservative leader he basically described to you for waves of contemporary conservative politics a Barry Goldwater responsible for one of 'em Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump says he's the each of these waves that connected to to the previous\nWell he does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all of these connected because you could make a case that philosophically they're all quite different um what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics like Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump was on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is\nBackstabbing complicity and ...\nCreated the swamp said that Trump now says he's trying\nTo drain right I'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when\nYou try to get him to talk about Trump is more or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end no I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions that Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics have gotten more tribal in more vicious than have kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nLike a ... of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich

done before Bram Sable Smith reports curly\nNot somebody who's healthy and in their thirties Charlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association in like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was wrong\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week in a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making

something was really wrong back in January Charlie came in he already knew he had the flu actually his wife had two but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER\nBy the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause organs to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week his father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say goodbye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the

but Charlie was young and healthy\nIt can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in\nAnd that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings did get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know they got to

Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax\nI voted for President Trump and the homeless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory

more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're you probably are global sales have been out pacing your domestic sales while\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger to sailors more than half their market maybe over\nFrom the ... but yes they\nThe free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well an apt to any you agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens at this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nWe don't like the option on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase tests are taxes no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you have people you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back\nA which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid in the obvious as the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nUh [noise] I think we all understand or know winters are a trade war and you know we're weak\nDamage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue yet\nYou made an issue like intellectual yeah it has come up I mean\nCongressman Barr has been very helpful to us and the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how did the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means to Kentucky or he will not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes uh\nAnd and he he told us he understood exactly that this would this mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks that I guess that's the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike you know highly David sandwich announce it can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith bourbon you've got to make it here in America and if you want to sell it you better make in Kentucky beginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been\nA I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and and from a price standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might\nNext we turn to the effort to total damage from hurricane Michael which hit Florida Panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable roads and
