in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage their relations for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty\nOne of the problem that you're trying to address oh we're trying to deal with the problem a partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw\n... ... feet at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the people let's\nBe blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that it's slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their badge\nNo I don't think I Would criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\nWell we have at stake\nI'm twenty Eighteen and who will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process and twenty Twenty one state legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty Eighteen\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to

attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address\nOh we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering ah we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after to draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level\nAnd then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people let's\nBe blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that it's slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans in conservative groups were spending\nEnough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and

rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench will look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says as they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ensure a a a
