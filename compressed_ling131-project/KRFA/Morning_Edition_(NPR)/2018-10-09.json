it's maybe not the most surprising news well I had been hearing\nThat she told them six months ago that she wanted to take some time off at the end of after two years in office um he is quoted as saying that he hopes Haley will come back in a different role he says you can take your pick\nAnd so far Haley you know isn't really pushing him aside or criticize him or anything to the contrary she's saying that other countries may not like what the US's does but they respected so again she she kind of\nKeeps their distance from Trump but also supports them\nLet's put her in the in the

heard some solid names I mean there was a lot of talked before about Dina Powell who left the White House before she was a a Bush administration official and went back to New York so she might be a
