he has a personal connection with allegations and he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all of that and Republicans it took great pains to not criticized Christine Blasey Ford even going so far is that they\nShe is credible right they have gone they're gone out of their way to create a paper trail and to kind of make\nThe case that they are listening to Ford and they're going through all of the appropriate steps of having the FBI investigation the supplemental investigation into these accusations

you know from the vent decision be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to an athlete you know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them that's on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes biting searching an element of\nRight the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quote somewhat arrogant approach and so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses the virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to the antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness and too important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process I mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can develop\nFuel or better medicines and in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel are ... are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price sale\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years\nUm the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know it's a little bit um

a foot army but then intelligent did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to

the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to an athlete you know\nWho won so half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia\nAnd Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing Utah\nChemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quote somewhat arrogant approach and so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including ... that's what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to the antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting random nothing too important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world [laughter] well you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process I mean you know enzymes\nMore environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel are ... are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price deal\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only a fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years I'm deprived can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to
