French scientist and Donna Strickland a Canadian both of whom did much of their work at the University of Rochester what does that work\nThey did something called a short pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development at the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then\nThey sort of got brighter and brighter and then they sold out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many application\nOkay we're going to

thought oh no no no no no no no doubt this I'm going to I'm going to borrow more I don't know I'm sure I'm going to talk about my ... year in mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett

exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anchor\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger\nWhite women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march and it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history and it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really just missing a lot of quarters as being about the cats the push he had you know a bunch of women getting together and there is a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road\nBut this week and of course then that gets us to a year

of\nThe founding our founders who were the white men chafing again\nThis is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation they codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so do you think those voices are being heard loudly\nEnough in this moment I think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers are so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color who were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their\nThomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual
