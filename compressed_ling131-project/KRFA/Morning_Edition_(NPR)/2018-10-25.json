S. much of the country's retirement plans\nAre invested into the stock market but not in China and it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy I'd say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years to President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war with China manipulating its currency\nWell it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much\nImposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there well\nFrom a kind of time speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war\nAnd that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U.

it means\nAnything for college basketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically the channeling of money\nTo a particular school and what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas a Nike or those those uh operations\nHave gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money\nSo that will surprise here is that it has been criminalize 'em by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. is it's been done for years and it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that a someone would be banned from\nThe NC double a a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man now it's like ... which is which is a step I Am

players in eligible\nNCWA rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the universities that have given them scholarships and therefore

questions to commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your inquiries each week about how politics and the government work either Cokie I see that it's certainly a big question now this relationship works and here's our first question\nThis is Nicole back from Nashville\nIt was not oil for arms and soil and arms\nOf recent years the United states has become much more self sufficient in terms of energy but Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil and more important incredibly influential in the international setting of oil prices\nBut it's also purchasers President Trump has repeatedly said of arms made by U.S companies but there's something more and that is mainly Iran the United states is saying Saudi Arabia is a check on Iran both in the region internationally and\nTo the extent that it's alive issues us also thinks that Saudi Arabia or could be helpful and then the elusive Israeli Palestinian peace agreement\nAbout oil is also on the minds of our next listener hello my name is Shawn fits Morris I'm from New Orleans Louisiana out of the U.S view Saudi Arabia before oil was affecting thank you\nThere was no view before oil was a thing a lot of the Arabia as we know it was became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year inside an agreement with standard oil of California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company\nWhich is now owned by the Saudi state and that happened even before it was clear how oil rich the country would be\nThe leader for a unified the country and started the relationship with the U.S with\nThen one of those sons the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman we've been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nEither does al Al's from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence as the United states have over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nWell I'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert a the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen where the Saudis have been accused of bombing civilians and closing off\nAccess to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place but because Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting the United states has sided with the Saudis\nBut they're ... and Congress which showed up in the last defense bill of trying to protect civilians\nAnd there's talk of sanctioning Saudi Arabia in some way because of the journalist killing us well Cokie thanks as always good to
