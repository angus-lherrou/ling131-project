opportunity but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future as as many kids by finding the dip code where they grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties you said you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but\nThat for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that as it is a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nAnd with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income let our border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlet but we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nFounded moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten the head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents it you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte\nAs a driving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\n... percent surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty\nSo I saw what she saw was segregated city where a low income black residents especially faced a little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem the group identified early childhood development\nCollege and career readiness families stability and strong social networks that key factors that enhance upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity to effectively targets some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of a map of median income\nCharlotte said a lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown\nWho grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nAct on these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration that community partnership Charlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at ... field middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte\nBut it's just in principle Eric ... says the schools students are mostly black\nSo we have forty point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced for now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that\nBeyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThe century old neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may as soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man that's social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead\nThose kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood Ford says the opportunity at should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permit just to try and make a really smart really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years gone allowed me to look and say yeah that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction Mecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has committed to providing pre K for all children the city of Charlotte\nIn their local neighborhoods John
