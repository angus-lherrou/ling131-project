once the capital of ISIS territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nOn the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was\nFrom ISIS full Steve a rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open is kind of bustling in a way but was curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIs sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they say there are more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous\nWater sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning

roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states that control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad they can\nSort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little aces here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians frightened\nThat was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty\nAnd what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money they had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people\nAnd it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates\nThat got these programs rolling again now President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars\nTo the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq\nAnd other liberated areas

stadium now how\nIs the city different than it was when you were there early in the years shortly after it was captured from ISIS for Steve Rogers seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear clean water is widely available\nIs the shops are open on their first floors of a lot of buildings\nIs sort of a skeleton of the
