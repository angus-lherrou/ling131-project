Halloween costumes\nIt was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and I felt like who doesn't want the animal she wants to look like they interrupt for one day I I don't know how like that got raised about hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nPearl your kids watch at home than it just is white and she was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments [noise]\nWill these aren't ah the only examples of\nGranted those remarks but I remember back in twenty ten um she's been a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours\nIn a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal or threatened just for about ten minutes to she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously uh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA a homicide detective ... farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about uh the question of a African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed among the show\nAnd do you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah what she felt was the acceptability a blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole thing about this controversy\nYeah uh uh of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect us starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which is\nReally interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the weight and networks handle these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you to just play some popular collies\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she'd been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now

about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something out and making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and
