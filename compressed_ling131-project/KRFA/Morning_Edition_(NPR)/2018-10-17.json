Trump Administration to try and find out what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... the writer disappeared after entering Saudi Arabia us consulate in Istanbul\nCause you'll do you have been critical of the Saudi Government and many people believe he was killed by Saudi agents but the Saudis so far are denying any knowledge and President Trump so far seems to be taking them at their word\nNPR's Peter Kenyon is with us now from his symbol Hi Peter I know so secretary of state Pompeo was on something the fact finding mission here oh what did he learn or not learn in these meetings in Riyadh and in Turkey\nIf you learn anything new from the Saudis there's been no public discussion of that so far as he did say Riyadh is coming\nStill that he left the consulate freely within an hour of arriving and they don't know where he is a there are however these multiple media accounts reporting the Saudis were preparing to acknowledge ... died in the consulate during questioning\nTurkey ... certainly got a very different story a Turkish investigators said they have audio video evidence of the show just killing and dismembered meant at some more gruesome details are coming out today\nAfter the meeting today Turkey's foreign minister uh wouldn't comment on those media reports uh but he said a full investigation will be conducted\nWell we know that Turkish authorities are looking hard I mean they've searched the conflict where cars so gee disappeared two weeks ago and now we're hearing that those same authorities are waiting for approval to search the Saudi consul residents are what are they hoping to find\nWell police barricades did go up around the consul general's residence last night journalists were waiting outside but the investigators didn't show up at Turkey's foreign minister says today ah they were waiting for final mission they're expecting the search to happen today or\nThis or to the cause of the building Monday did healed evidence that to

girls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the street selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls are still on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by pro public\nAnd on the ground in Liberia like an army Macintosh Johnston tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier [noise]\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way to keep it could be using these girls\nWas heavily involved in the recruitment of girls thought he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ...\nAnd he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within the scope of power according to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened\nSomething that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho said that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd I my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh junk Ken was arrested did trial it was a hung jury and after that if it were a field that she had HIV rain [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nDid and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outline in the peace ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools were the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feel that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this to be that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allowed the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and then also the local local ...\nSo there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has no the foo investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm um they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we are both her process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether they charge ... policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public or talking to Rachel Martin since

years ET women who were abducted by ISIS we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this to one as a woman to\nBe punished for the crimes they committed against gives me the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to be winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done\nA lot left to do what is next for you after

reading comprehension Lyndon mood bell dot com slash NPR\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Noel King more than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian girls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nStories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with the charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's up more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking us most that are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she started the organization\nSpend volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship and then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight [noise]\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management that you\nKnow and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia like an army Macintosh John Callas about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he's doing\nThe organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within the scope of power according to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what are you doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview\nBut that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho said that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loved the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh junk\nThe rain [noise] while it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors that was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nOn as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls I'm are potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in the court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were retested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlining the peach Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization which responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools were the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this to be that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated but I think that to to view this as you know just uh\nAbuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allow the organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up with an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community had the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something's gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has not just a a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we are both our process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was which followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since
