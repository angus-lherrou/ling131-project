I'm Rachel Martin election day is\nNovember sex voters will go to the polls to cast their ballot but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life this week we're bringing you personal\nFamily of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity did I hear that you've been taking online courses to figure out where you actually live in the eye\n[laughter] because I don't know I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes yeah I almost feel guilt\nThat I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nAll we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about you know politics social issues\nWhat I grew up hearing [noise] as you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape short it was after the twenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working in\nImmigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want people coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there's another solution that there is a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes they still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but I I feel like we should be listening\nI watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those how did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics for the election [noise]\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been raped so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of bullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me it's\nI don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year [noise] what do you think about President Trump\nI'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on strictly party lines and and rather than going out\nAnd considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your about your evolution\nI have been avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think left to me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why are we to say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nElectric
