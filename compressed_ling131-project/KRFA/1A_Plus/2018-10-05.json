Jews the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close\nAlmost entirely along partisan lines the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnd we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate to kind of test but not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as\nLong as well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving has covered politics for very long time as well good morning to get both in mourning mourning so you've thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama the last couple\nOf weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kevin gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well I was going to be a much more conservative part regardless whoever Donald Trump picked from his famous last it was going to be something\nIt's sort of like a balanced bored sometimes\nMainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way to the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the vote is five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and\nThey may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on legal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue the conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would be a good heart even this\nTerm which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to in the rest yet to come there are three cases asking for reversal of very long\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in ... and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that ...\nThat example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nAnd and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave his speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying this nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republican\nBecause of division and the Republican ranks there been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska another one being Susan Collins of Maine\nWho issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that she spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to a to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor\nIs that I'm voting yes voting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do a later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works right Ron Elving it is but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for\nPeople to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and when I met on why we should do that\nWell that the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't\nAnd at the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor she has not said that let's be fair which she did\nShe may I don't think she's actually\nWell who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that he's on her and she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the rules were different when that sort of thing would happen you'd get sixty votes for cloture and then maybe only fifty two votes to pass and there you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote\nAnd win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who is a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today\nHer decision on the final vote and then there is a Republican who is never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the facts free verdict of the mob and the media would win out over the actual\nEvidence made sure the mob prevail\nThe corroborate of mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nBut they got to step closer today with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News\nLet's bring another voice into the conversation now more lately is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly ... you got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learned this news at the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kevin\nYou know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about a ... there's actually two people I'm kind of curious to watch over the next twenty four hours a and they are the um [noise]\nUh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know she might be actually trying to\nUh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know he deserves the vote I'm going to vote no but he deserves about that could be possible I think that's likely about possible and the other person is Joe mansion um who\nI think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised or an his vote today a to a his vote for cloture hum but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now uh if if I were a betting man\nI Want to note there's so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or\nReinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing and then there's the reality of politics we are deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one or plausibly although it's a long shot in both\nHouses of Congress could flip\nAnd we have mentioned in our live coverage here\nThat there are about ten Democratic senators who were seen as vulnerable representing states that voted for President Trump and now up for reelection\nThemselves nine of them chose to vote against this nominee even though it was perceived as potentially politically damaging to them I Want to I'm going to bring the medical minds and our our political editor into this conversation in a moment but let me ask you first Mr ...\nNorthwest public broadcasting ... thinking\nIs special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we had been listening\nIn the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate the vote was fifty one forty nine fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and ...\nSpecifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that she would give a different statement sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock\nAs to what her actual vote would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nBut the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote\nFor a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault and then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break into Schumer's word\nIn terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his\nHarsh and partisan testimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nNPR's domestic Oman tomorrow can start us off here than a segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything that surprised to your ear to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no us certainly shows you know the kind of independent she shown over the years is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate beat the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now allow that to Alaska and well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because\nShe's very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states so she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't all Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profile in courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought\nCould be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion\nAh because of the politics of either their pockets with Collins or of their state with Joe man I remember\nAs a profile in courage we're defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody was high state well at that time on that I'm not a fix what's her job and I mean that not as a Democrat that pro democratic state I mean that\nSomebody who would ... going on in their votes\nIt's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor leader when it comes to the actual final vote\nThat leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be still be fifty votes to be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor\nBut protesters outside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake and an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday I must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward [noise]\n\n\nI suppose it statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating\nConflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories so we have the broad issue\nAnd then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure the judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this just ended a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing\nFor somebody to be promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference then and there was a moment today of\nThe bitter is to pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way and it was when um minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass Mitch McConnell's lips merit\nEven a hearing any Mitch McConnell said Mitch McConnell said we're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with the just about a year left in his presidency\nAnd he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject and his own caucus and made that happened and never bat an eye led and and and Obama had thought he was doing a I'm a\nA reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick the effect of moderate he picked a moderate liberal uh of ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination was the oh a\nWhole month at that\n... that you feel the reverberations of that still even though there was only one reference to Merrick\nToday a Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening to this and as I listen to me\nThe middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick as your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen but when you're on\nAn says that I've just had which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take a moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the day and and and so now the the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started in Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way no it depends on what what a beginning point you want to want the set for when the story started to go wrong yes there are some similarities here\nAnd for Republicans years Nineteen eighty seven that was when Robert Bork was appointed by Ronald Reagan to the Supreme Court and up as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed\nAnd the Democrats did have a small majority in the Senate at the time they had just one of the year before they had one it's largely by winning back a lot of southern seats they had lost in Nineteen eighty and the first Ronald Reagan\nOther senators made the case that those southern Democrats really owed those black voters a long hard look at whoever was next going on the Supreme Court all along comes Robert Bork who was willing to quite freely admit he had highly conservative views remarkably eye opening eye popping views on some of the oldest Supreme Court precedents\nAnd the Democrats were appalled in the hearings he was somewhat combative himself in the hearings not to not like Brett Kavanaugh was last Thursday but he was certainly pushing back on all of the assertions that were made about him\nAnd so when it finally came to vote in committee he lost in committee Democrats voted against him and when when it went to the floor there were even some Republicans from southern states voted against him because of some of the extreme positions he had taken Republicans have never forgotten Nineteen eighty so\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected to\nTomorrow there was a handful of votes that we were closely watching about four senators whose votes runs certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Republican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kavanaugh or at least have to vote no against uh on on uh\nUh put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there's at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote when the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but she'd give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today\nNPR's to medical ... still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what\nWhat evidence do we have to go on to the way she's leading well\nLook like you lay out here everyone's watching the court had you know the final four voters are and there is a possibility that people vote differently for a cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins\nAnd she's already done it that Congress she did it on the nomination of ... the device for education secretary in fact she wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote so she voted differently in the committee to advance her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the pot and pot tensions [laughter] there's your health committee yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but then that she still had concern about how ... how much you would be strong on public education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was one Republican one Republican or out of fifty one who voted no this has been a very very partisan vote to move to equally part of the Democratic side as an up\n[noise] well I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against voting on against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do\nA usually people uh want to at least allow the vote to proceed or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote\nIt sends a really strong signal about how troubled she is by this by this nominees fitness to serve on our highest court\nSo I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote but I think this nomination is in trouble and so today's\nProcedural vote is just the preview for uh the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow\nYou don't presume that this was settled I don't need a Totenberg so you know there's been\nSenior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which a Christ English is both [laughter] so at\n... and and Dianne Feinstein who said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third wave is could have gone it it was there a better way for the Democrats to have handled it realistically now\nSo I think it is it's in retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein as ranking member handled this as she handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality protected did not want to become public\nAnd I think Senator Feinstein honored her wishes\nAnd I think that's admirable but other people think it is less admirable but uh you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein showed that she really understands what the whole me too movement is about\nWhich is when you are a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if ever you decide to tell your story\nI'm thinking about that was it impossible for her to tip all for your for your two mentioned it to someone so there could be very quiet\nSomeone had come forward from Rhode Island\nOr to the chairman staff and the chairman staff released the person's name\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could\n... you know share it with other members and still preserved confidentiality or share it even with the FBI and still preserved confidentiality so I view it as Senator Feinstein really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticizing\nI suppose we should mention that the confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or staff have been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people that could have been there was another lawmaker at least one of the lawmaker who uh had possession of the letter we don't know who else might have been told\nAnd in what way but in the end it leaked do you believe it ultimately had to leak was there an option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been uncorroborated and had an individual didn't want to go on the record\n[noise] well I I don't know who leaked it but I think that what\nExperience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week as there are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories\nI think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women have experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good and I'm I'm really worried that\nChristine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking hurt laughter and a campaign rally\nSense exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere that they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and they'll be mocked\nYou know let me ask about one thing along those lines are from our colleague David Greene spoke earlier today with Julie ... she's a journalist for the Atlantic who wrote a long article a touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she described herself as a victim of past sexual assault when she was in her teams\nBut said there was a difference between the broad issue of needing to listen to women needing to take seriously and investigate these kinds of allegations a difference between the broad issue and the specific question of whether a specific individual can be proved guilty through some neutral process here\nHas there been some confusion of one with the other on this issue people that work\nBut his guilt or not killed this is a job interview\nAnd Republicans prevented any corroborating or supporting witnesses from being hurt by the committee and then Republicans prevented the FBI from reaching out to people who would support Christine Blasey Ford's account or Debbie Ramirez is account so I find it really troubling that\nEven though it is not a criminal trial the standard should certainly not be proof beyond a reasonable doubt\nBut instead they're supposed to be looking at his fitness to serve and his fitness when has multiple women coming forward and when he's testifying under oath and his testimony is contradicting other things he said or other people's account other witnesses accounts even on smaller issues like drinking\nOh\n\nThat was a poll come ashore
