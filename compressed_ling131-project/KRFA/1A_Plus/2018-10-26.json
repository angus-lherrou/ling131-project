C. one person is now in federal custody after a nationwide bomb scare the Justice Department will hold a news conference later this afternoon to share more details\nNow this news comes on follows the discovery of two more potentially threatening packages this morning one of them was addressed to New Jersey\nFollowing this fast moving story I carry hire new well so what do we know that the person now in custody well not much a law enforcement source tells me it is a man based in Florida we don't yet know his name or his background or importantly whether he acted alone\nWe also have to know whether this person was motivated by politics are personal reasons or some other reason\nThe Justice Department says it's going to hold a news conference at two thirty pm eastern time to provide more details on this unfolding case only this morning investigators found a package addressed a former intelligence chief James Clapper in New York and also disclose that they had found a package in Florida addressed to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nWell a lot of attention in this case it focused on Florida overnight a local police searched a male facility what were they looking for\nLast night authorities were searching a package sorting facility and Florida and open ... near Miami be operating fury with some of the packages went through that facility in through the u._s. mail\nThey were looking for more devices but also any other clues and local TV and Florida is now beaming images of a strong law enforcement presence in plantation Florida at a site that appears to be connected to the suspect in federal custody a lot of manpower has been deployed nationwide though the postal inspectors the FBI\nSo of course the New York city police department to and there's also some ongoing activity in Virginia right yes in Virginia\nThe bulk of the investigation there is that the FBI lab in Quantico which has been analyzing some of these devices which look like homemade pipe bombs they've been looking for clues for\nHow the bombs were constructed and they've also been looking for DNA or fingerprints the bomber may have left behind no word yet on whether anything they found in that analysis has helped lead them to the suspect in South Florida\nOh that's interesting we'll have to wait and see a boat so I mean one notable thing this whole time is that none of these bombs that actually exploded and so there's been some speculation that maybe they couldn't explode they didn't have the capacity what investigators said about that theory\nThe record police sources and the FBI are declining to answer questions about whether the these bombs could it presented a lethal threat to anyone on background overnight in earlier this morning I was hearing\nA law enforcement was inclined to think they did not present a lethal threat there could be a reason for that some former bomb analyst at the ATF has raised questions about whether these devices included a key component that would have set them off that would have detonated it appeared from the photos that were made public that perhaps\nWhen they were looking at any manila envelopes or any suspicious packages because uh they needed to be considered a potential threat\nAnd they law enforcement right now even as advising people to call authorities call police called the FBI face see anything suspicious now we know that the New York police commissioner James O'Neill son last last afternoon\nThat the device they've recovered in New York that was addressed to the actor Robert Deniro did not pose a biological threat to not\nContain anthrax or any material like that but that authorities were still treating all of these parcels as potentially dangerous and the analysis may not be done yet as to what and all of these uh these bombs potential lumps so law enforcement officials still have a long way to go here\nAnd PR is justice correspondent Carrie Johnson Carrie thank you so much for the update my
