money that you have seen the Saudis statement\nWhat does it tell you about how the kingdom is handling crush\nWhat we see is that for the first time officially the Saudis say that Jamal ... is dead\nThe account places blame on senior advisors none of them ... ... for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there's a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on these senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed the dissident journalist\nThey covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership failed to confirm his death earlier bad news travels slowly to the top is how one Saturday defender put it on Twitter these latest account distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince\nBut there are so many questions left to be answered\nIt was handed over to a local Turk for disposal Turkish authorities have been continuing this investigation and now it's

explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough entrenched\nEarlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi or explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like\nBoth Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't\nHave business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in ... in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis the end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen\nWhich by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we\nUs has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it\nBut there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ...\nManners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a\nWe have left a it's not just to expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy\nAnd that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen\nTop two weeks is unacceptable ... thank you\nThank you\nShouldering for profit is it new you probably remember Hector mercenaries from grade

joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation and such a demand\nFor the last Seventeen years feel special forces and other parts of the U.S government have a child at this\nAnd they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is mhm\nBut your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty Fifteen [noise]\nThese special forces and and feel veterans maybe feel\nVeterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the eight and branch of al Islam and all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen as soon as long as the party but it's not viewed\nThe LA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us report now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had a ... a top secret clearance source told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know and\nI guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal Jewish citizens couldn't do that there are laws that do govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can list in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are numbers on lots of a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way that doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the ...\nAnd been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\n[noise] right it's just an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or oh they're the only ones who've done this or there are other countries to try it [noise] um are there other Americans\nOther than the ones in rather American people leave you've uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it and\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there's several reasons what is a there's a lot of money involved but\nThey also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he's doing U.S policy the U.S has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we sell them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir argument is they're doing what the you know basically the U.S a U.S foreign policy anyway\nSo they've they suggest you which patriotism yes his era must an investigative reporter for buzzfeed thanks

few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week\nIt included a photo of the smiling face of metal ... in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for ... but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and try to oxycontin at a high school party\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and links and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age\nHer sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're [noise] we're sorry\nShe loved to saying she wanted to be an actress than star and Broadway musical than she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with those spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nA ... real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was ...\nProgram and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program I go there to ... yeah she tried many [noise] what made you pure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lived\nAnd to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carried out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that the death stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication\nDr in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver there aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing\nI also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people in that part of the reason that we wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service for ... Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances\nOne of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know they've also shared stories about their own addiction and recovery and family members and that kind of huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now [noise]\nAnd I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday what\nBonnie rich on there [noise] I Can't make you left me\nA indeed fun now a\nCaterer Neal wrote about her sister Maddy Lynch mayor and the Vermont were seven days thank you so much for being with you thank you so much for having me\nNot me\nIf you don't know\nI Know I Know\n...\nHow long Franklin is post forty or an English exiled who's had a pretty humdrum time\nFor washing machines Sarah Perry rush in her new novel melon most Helen has an Arab sadness who sorcery cannot get shot [noise] Carol a scholar friend Gibbs hell in a pile of checks histories diaries letters footnotes\nAnd she begins to find in those pages the outlines of a woman reaches across country from seventeenth century England Germany the Nineteen forties or modern day manila to witness to absorb the horror of the forgotten and forlorn ...\nSarah Perry author of the international bestseller the ethics or ... joins us now from New York Thanks so much for being with us thank you for having me sketch Mel must enforce could you please [noise]\nThe premise of the novel is that it's very lonely women begin to hear that there is a ... so called ... most the witness\nWho had been down to one they are the two thousand did witnessing humanity ethics west and she knows what you've done she knows what ifs thoughts and it comes to you and she says look\nI Know how weak you are and how how it late and if anybody else you they wouldn't want it but I'm lonely why don't you come away with me and she often people hand and she says take my hand I've been so lightly\nFind some kind of redemption contentment Helen here's about his legend and she stopped to think that may be Mel most is watching her\n\nFrom NPR News in Washington DC this weekend\nI'm Scott Simon this hour the latest on your mouth shut the\nDoor to rabies says he died in a fight in the army surrounded by Fifteen Saudi security and later do Republicans don't sound like Democrats on election\nGlenn Close suddenly and the mother of a famous murder of\nDr Harriet average on a ... operation on an incident where she had to wait the risk of disease\nAnd the child is getting really caffeine is missing I needed to be ventilated\nAnd we were at the point where it's questioned why niche and he would you rather die\nWhat it is with HIV first or a newscaster Saturday I cover twenty two thousand [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News to Washington on trial\nAnd rejects the claim from Riyadh that the case was under Saudi jurisdiction Saudis now acknowledging the death of course she claimed it was accidental as NPR's Peter Kenyon reports\nAn article in the pro government daily so bond newspapers dates that claim by crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon of Saudi jurisdiction over the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul is wrong and that under the Vienna Convention of Nineteen sixty three the host country retains jurisdiction after more than two weeks of denials\nThe Saudis acknowledge ... death saying it occurred after a fight broke out Eighteen people were arrested\nThe new Saudis story drew immediate criticism on social media with critics pointing to a forensics expert brought into ...

the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now abandoned its intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales\nPresident Trump made that clear this week while he was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is focused [noise]\nThe president made that clear this week by spelling out is gender like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense\nNow the caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is older states rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs code for resistance to social change and common sense is another familiar phrase I recently used as a political cultural by the Tea Party\nAs you mentioned round the caravans been a feature of the the

topic well he\nHe took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called the showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nI Would prefer that we don't use as retribution\nNumbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact check or as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia

playing in the NBA for domestic Becky Hammon of course has already and assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs\nIs the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nI think it's coming and I think is overdue and I and I I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the and the NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA has been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with my colleague doors work on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses\nYou know sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm and

the ...\nFine and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made [noise] won't help\nUs understand that decision because you have to wear a lot of different factors to me\n[noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that through doing the surgery we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for a liver Darnah\nFor three times the average and the child with getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV what if the parents children [noise]\nSo the parents was saying to us why can't we ... we're well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy wouldn't you consider us so there was to me that wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the ...\nThat she could be a Darnah and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promote sending Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible so it was interesting that in this\nGod refuge do think this ah this case the more people know about it will love contribute something to lifting the stigma they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to her so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it it kind of multi faceted\nSays I from South Africa although we have this very well integrated national I'm a treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you're living in normal life\nThen that should preclude you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this\nThat that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nDark harried Etheridge medical bioethicist at ... medical center in Johannesburg thanks so much for

step it's a big said a lot of people a lot of people involved that I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... death what else did you say on the topic\nHe he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called cause showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contract\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact check or as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given how quickly in the past\nHe has leveled very blunt criticism of other us

... thanks very much for being with us thank you got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of your mouth to shrug gee\nWe turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey as the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us to be based on all of your experience does the Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise Robin\n... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them\nMain argument of your book is is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid unborn society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries on to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in in the rhetoric that we are\nSo I thirty seconds we have left a it's not just to expressing outrage there practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us\nWe're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen cops you weeks is unacceptable\nEven colder thank you thank you\nThe state of depressed

appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal to blend in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from its perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for ... but she suffered from addiction\nHave been lost custody up or some metal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to saying she wanted to be an actress than star and Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real the saw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was ... she was just such a pleasure to be with those spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did she tried an octave cotton which is\nOpiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get them help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nYou're drug ... more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lived\nAnd to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted\nAnd politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that the death stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know [noise]\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver there aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing\nI also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that we wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a\nA video of Matty singing Bonnie rate song she'd just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and

been the one that has been better on on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with my colleague doors work on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that we do here I Want to know yes [laughter] I Know and in in that sport it's a big\nDeal in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two

they it just becomes a serving contests but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation with weave when
