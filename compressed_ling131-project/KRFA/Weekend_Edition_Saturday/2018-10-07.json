good morning either look\nIt's a very confusing tale um talk us through what do we know\nWell we know ... walked into the Saudi councilor Tuesday around one in the afternoon he needs\nClosed us as he never came out a Turkish police opened an investigation and then came the surprising reports first by unnamed Turkish officials now on the record by an advisor to president ... on that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate\nA aired on says he's saddened that the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so far we haven't seen any evidence to back up this claim that show is dead just the persistent question if he's still alive where Izzie\nYou know what if this is ... what the Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that the show he did come into the consulate Tuesday Afternoon or the Saudi press agency quotes officials saying he left the consulate Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News\nThey're very keen to know what happened to him a there is no evidence on the outside of wherever to show that show he actually did leave the consulate\nUh the consul general invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of ... he said that constantly has multiple exits but why would they show the lead by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting up front\nSo lots of questions this advisor to president

bitter dispute with the Saudis\nAre some are wondering what the American response is going to be a ... an important ally to the U.S does turkey has so far officials said only they're aware and

feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that\nA lot of women that are shrewd way from Memphis\nThat to an echo of something that he said at a rally last week a in Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked her for her lapses in memory\nAnd Trump said on the plane

S. where NPR's Jackie Northam reports Washington is pushing back\nThe U.S is unquestionably the leader in advanced technology think artificial intelligence robotics ticketed weaponry it's what help give the country and national security edge\nThat something China has recognized and wants in on the James Lewis specialist in China and technology at the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThe Chinese figured out the technology is the key to wealth and power and the source of technology is still the west for China so how do they get their hands on the western technology\nThree years ago Beijing unveiled it's made in China twenty twenty five strategy which calls for the country to become a world leader in advance technology including artificial intelligence AI as part of

espionage who's on the table which can include recruiting key talent at networking events that are sponsored by the Chinese government [noise] working with us universities\nJust last week Bloomberg reported to us with investigating whether China allegedly infiltrated the Pentagon and major companies such as apple and Amazon by building by chipped in to serve her mother board the mother board were manufactured in China that companies denied the allegations\nBut there are other ways China is making inroads to capture\nThrough the quiet leafy part in Silicon valley called Sunnyvale and a lot

the market rate you'll get a lot of talent this is a way to acquire no\nThere's also been a surge of investment in tech start up to Chinese venture capital Adam ... senior analyst at rodeo group an economic research firm ... there were more than Thirteen hundred round the funding for us start up with at least one Chinese investor over the past eight years\nIs very common for Chinese firms to have some sort of ties to the government but might just be because they have to answer to the government of party leaders back at home and the first state some level of control\nI think that this has become a concern and national security circles because ...\nPhones could also be applied to weapons on the battlefield I think that while he's not aware of any smoking gun case where a Chinese venture capital has plundered sensitive technology from the start up it's widely acknowledge at a risk exists\nThat venture capital and other minority investments provide Chinese investors access potentially spent for the technologies particularly ones that are in in this tent an early stage where US government haven't had a full chance to evaluate the implications of those technologies\nBut for many

is one way Washington is trying to counter Chinese investment\nThe Trump Administration has also been aggressive in blocking several large mergers and acquisitions of us tech company by Chinese firms\nAnd Congress is beefing up laws on the books end up protecting us technology from foreign governments it will allow close scrutiny of all sorts of Chinese inroads in the tech sector\nSays Mario

Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into very big controversies there is for example right now a

know still very much thank you my\nName's Nicole child was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to state you know if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because the story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us\nAs an adult ... did start to ask questions and a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her church for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussion\nThat the my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was simulate tree chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAsked to then it made perfect sense to kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges that you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say that the racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like things down chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents experience as white America and I really remember feeling as
