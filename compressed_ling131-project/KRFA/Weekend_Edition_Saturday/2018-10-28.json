twelve people were gathering here at the bus station ready to head north by nightfall thousands were on buses added this violent city more than a third of the country's homicides are committed here\nAnd then it says along with the violence there are also not enough jobs\nThat are like and I think a lot of either that or that that will support the living better left or the middle of all I

Pittsburgh this suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock\nAre we getting getting it as in understanding all we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is\nDoing to us all one big factor in that is language and rhetoric and also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impact our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from the precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the GOP position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after\nThe hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act so we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of very ill and political rhetoric [noise]\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders oh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise] what's at this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls from major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new [noise]\nYou've actually research tells language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration a so you are looking at how the way we discussed certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals view an entire group of people\n[noise] absolutely yeah so in in one recent study with Renee floors who the sociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white American\nOverwhelmingly after the undocumented immigrant with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America it's not hard to get what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we hypothesized we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chamber of whoever consuming very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in the temple\nPeople kind of political divide 'em and has invaded invaded our mind\nAnd the wider issue that we are affected by the language that we hear in ways that we might be unconscious of\n\nI'm we're wrong with these headlines a forty six year old man is in custody facing twenty nine charges after a mass shooting at a synagogue yesterday [noise] eleven people were killed and six others were wounded including for police officers that suspect reportedly had no criminal record but had posted anti Semitic posts on line\nPresident Trump has ordered flags that federal buildings throughout the country flown at half staff to show respect for the dead he also condemned what he called

from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference and was about to start in Pittsburgh this morning eleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people are injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning\nHi Lou uh we're waiting to hear from officials to oh what do we know so far about the victims well what we know that eleven\nPeople were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial service that I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well yeah\nI hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nOr the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody out the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the death of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the mode of how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning and this was a an out of the religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] put this into context for us there ... there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead and one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil on eleven people killed a rabbinical group that represents concerts\nTeach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in\nDecades yeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seemed like everyone is really um grappling with this ... ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning rate um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and\nStill I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicle\nUh lots of journalists and um people as they all we do in these situations have begun you know laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the Pentagon around the corner\nAnd and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as the athletes\nBreathing is really just beginning here [noise] I think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nYou have other mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a ... of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opens doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like that happened ... so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and ... and so uh that's just one small thing the communities doing to try to help stay I'm least I'm Jewish and otherwise ah throughout the community in Pittsburgh a cope with what's happened here\nThe tragedy that happened again and again around the country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nIt depends on which elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accepted violence as a normal part of American Life\nI'm ... something that has become more and more common place in American Life an elect\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon addressed the shooting a marking that if there'd been an armed guard inside that going to God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president with adjusted that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there'd been mass shootings in recent years the gift tax is that the actively carry out death sentences but unless the president is it calling for that to be more of the conversation and\nObviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were\nA ... and said that the heat that essentially that this was a you know sick thing to do and so he's he's certainly called it out I'm a ... of course you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it uh what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise]\nWell I think in these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations uh edit that I've covered several mass shootings now three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this than\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the the lot right is shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime that they can prosecute investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me\nThe medic an anti immigrant a motive that told us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but uh it is being investigated ad that as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about ah as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities and Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media\nUm and there are a lot of questions about about why this happens and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nWe're going to bring in ... or Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara good morning morning [noise]\nSo I set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how we are actually starting this press conference now I'm we're going to go there live here we don't\nOffer most heartfelt condolences and prayers to the victims of yesterday's rentals box of hatred and violence to the families and friends to Pittsburgh Jewish community and to the larger community of Pittsburgh Jewish community of Pittsburgh\nAs an attack upon our neighbors and upon our friends and one that we felt very deeply\nThe fact that this attack took place during the worship service makes it even more heinous a place of worship is a sacred place to place of peace in a place of grace to place where community comes together to celebrate that that they hold most dear and most sacred\nUh the the um the the sympathy that they need it yesterday evening at the uh I'm\nA synagogue we've um a synagogue and ... all eleven victims ah before they were removed and brought the synagogue last night to my office uh\nUh we've been involved with a for rabbis or from the synagogue and elsewhere uh they can have a continued presence at my office uh during the process or\nA um I get to give you the names of the victims now and these will be available

asked\nToday in the coming weeks we'll need to do the Pittsburgh go supports that but as a lifting them up like your\n[noise]\nHi I'm Jeff Finkelstein I'm the president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh [noise] um so I have to begin by saying that I've seen this room a lot of times on TV and I never thought I'd be at the podium\n[noise] um [noise]\nIs an awful awful period for a Jewish community and uh and especially for the families who've been affected [noise] and it's real when once you hear the names were going to do everything we can to help the families how we're in the process of doing that now\nAnd will be there for them and be there to help our Jewish community and the Pittsburgh region a heal from the [noise]\nI Want to echo a lot of the things in

community is the backbone is part of the fabric of Pittsburgh and we will be there in all communities to support our friends in the Jewish community we um\nAnd to think those that spoke earlier the effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions from the federal to the state to the county to the local\nWas something that we should all be proud of the fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics were after seeing\nOur medics deciding on their day off to voluntarily come in to fill seven additional ambulances to back up our officers and the officers who came from surrounding counties the federal agents in this state troopers and the county officers\nAll working together in

we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case she just say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn now to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning mourning Louis [noise]\nAll right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect to say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in ...\nWe'll be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's ah the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources\nMake all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a\nSoccer and body building in nightlife and then two years ago all this anger a in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale\nIn Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nIt's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a a Fort law\nWill advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros uh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in Soros in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you're struggling with coworkers including one who was in that town yet\nDeborah gradient was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWould start talking about it left me last Hitler Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we think it's a much thank you living in these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity\nAbout others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race to the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me [noise] so we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black floater or the teen of voters are any racial minority [noise]\nThey're presented as a model is black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true [noise]\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nWhite is the default so I have to eat it frequently\nFront of that statement and that silent whites me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nI I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial\nThey talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country\nMany journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles so when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nSo how did those two things then said when you're trying to discuss some of these racial divisions in this country\nWhen I was clearly argue we're all by it\nLiterally where voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt and we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it it's it's economic anxiety so that's biased\nBut also when we talk about fairness is it fair is it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment of those voters were white\nFrom NPR News in Washington DC this weekend edition\nUnder the guise of our good morning eleven worshipers were killed at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh\nWe learn more about the

effect we're having on the events happening around us\nHow are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all one big factor in that is language and rhetoric

Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw\nBack from the precipice during the presidential campaign [noise] but now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's just some little line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that men would targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo ... position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election or the hot

is a fraud political moment and here to help us make sense of it as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson good morning thanks for having me [noise] so obviously I'm a terrible news out of Pittsburgh we got the names of those who I'm actually were killed by this in this attack\nYeah let's just make a few things clear this was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest\nAssassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the president's in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this thought the president has\nMade a lot of unifying statements\nHe said these acts were evil he has\nAlso gone on to campaign and hold rallies kind of partisan politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did but just before a rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nFrankly the press was even handed the press was fair I'd have a much different out all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there is what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... this is a president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief no he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation\nBut he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change she's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energizes his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race in fear of crime fear of ...\nExtreme content keeps viewers on longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you know mid term elections are just over a week away will the events of this past week affects the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election or that they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were on a roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nNPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson ... thank you so much thank you\nThis morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life to the GOP but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case say oc is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn now to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring\nWell we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building and night life and then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he\nSure that's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale and say I begin making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in Soros in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail I understand you're struggling with coworkers including one who was\nIn that town [noise] [noise] yeah\n... was a manager at the new river pizza I\nWill say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWould start talking about that last last Hitler Hitler\nWe can go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre me think he'd come much thank you\nJust got today and one more Sunday before election day so it's time to look at the too big a house and Senate will do the Senate's first and we'll do it with NPR lead political editor to medical not to narrow good morning to medical good morning ...\nA third of the seats in the senator up at the constitution required Democrats are facing some tough mass but then we started hearing about a blue wave how's that water looking\nWell look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house than in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more seats that are held by Democrats in red or ... states that are up you have the worst landscape than the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending ... seats and just nine Republicans so will the Republicans pick up seats and\nIt's very possible in fact a you know some handicappers are looking at a potential a best case scenario for Democrats being net even right now it's fifty one forty nine in the Senate\nAnd are more likely scenario something like two to three seats lost from when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of the cycle and through this cycle they were hoping to store to be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscape and twenty Eighteen where they could go on often\nThe best target for Democrats is in Nevada with Dean Heller\nHis own uh Tennessee Texas Nevada they all started to try and a little bit more Republican in recent weeks while Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp\nA are not looking so good Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Democrats are really really hoping that in Indiana Joe Donnelly can hold that Jon Tester in Montana can hold and that Joe Manchin of West Virginia can to\nI'm going to have to bring up Florida because that's where I'm from uh what are you saying that it's such an interesting race\nYeah Florida is one of those races the Democrats are starting to feel a little bit better about you have the incumbent\nThere a Bill Nelson and they're feeling better about it because the governor's race with Andrew Gillum or at the top of the ticket for Democrats he's doing pretty well against Ron dissent is the Republican and Democrat I think that maybe Gillum could poll Nelson over the line\nSo you have an energetic newcomer actually helping an endangered incumbent um you know that's interesting yeah absolutely it's really fascinating\nYou are listening to northwest public broadcasting on K.

Navarro in these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of concerts\nSix weeks and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by ... Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me [noise]\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority [noise]\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nAnd and somehow the white as neutral and something\nTo win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting this story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about white people [noise]\nI think one we really down play I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see why people are voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring\n[noise] another way politicians may not explicitly say why but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did could very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country\nMany journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles so when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things then said when you're trying to discuss some of these ration\nSo that by to be very glaring clear because we were ignoring literally what voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about ... ... it's it's economic anxiety so that's biased\nBut also when we talk about fairness is it fair is it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment of those voters who are white\nTo me that is not fair it's not fair to all of the people in a country that at this point is about forty percent non white who we are rendering invisible and our coverage\n[noise] Nicole Anna Jones of the New York times magazine thank you so much thank you very much for having me\nThe final season of the Netflix political drama house of cards debuts on friday
