candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty feet I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling\nRunning war is a reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away [noise]\nYou know despite the threat from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we've really only seen numbers from the big cities and in the rural areas where people are most at threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by a policeman he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was shelling and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside bit of ... city and there's been regularity is as well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul a brought his the armed men and he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced it arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to you\nWhat will just mean they are guaranteed sixty eight seed in the parliament for each province\nUh but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidate to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things\nAnd just briefly what is it signify that the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people\nThat this was a country and conflict to conflict at the United states is involved and it is and there was a lot of controversy about whether the votes should be held at all but Afghan\nOfficials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going forward this vote and I think today they might be happy with

Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had been under fire\nSince the Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in temple that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region and so being with us\nMy pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east are proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty\nDifferent story I think there there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents um and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nAnd you're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um\nThe Washington Post columnist oh without their intelligence services leaking information it's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how it's affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract this much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are\nAre journalists as well and activist and the others and so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically defending a you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think uh\nFor turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why exposed Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated Dutch\nUh they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange the need to invest in it they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\n... and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see the balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for uh the u._s. government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nDestination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we're presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found their desk where various Lee blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist ... hadn't done this a published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told her the official version of the event was a fabrication\nIn these official version they're Mexican Government said that the army and if it up all these they didn't know anything about what was happening and they just get not these two or three hours after everything and these officials or what I have\nSeen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all these official bearish on satellite is not to its ally\nSo tell us what you uncover\nWhy is that the army and the for the police not just where not about why the ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just east even more\nI had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if the police were chasing this to dance scenes they laughed at school I mean see I was before that [noise] so the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police\nThey state police were waiting for them than they do then decide to move that to Boston where they were transport dating inside to this CD [noise]\nTo be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the was take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City so they went to both the station\nDay to do this we both us and when their students were trying to escape ... will be spy buses from me\nShoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're always at the end of that back way to Boston from these two buses disappeared all that forty three students [noise] so\nThe federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students who are on the buses disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wife I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling in five ... that's why that that a good was just too\nSo the two bosses what exactly did to both is that the army and they said that police it starts to monitor it\nSeems to have a ... before I mean these two bosses would that do both is what their students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses where uh\nOf heroin they didn't know the students didn't know it for the army and if the police they knew that [noise]\nSo the students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what these guys that are really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus [noise]\nI was able to connect with one drug lord important drug lord I was able to contact with one person that works for him and glass these uh informant and inside the cartels that explained made this ... [noise]\nDo we know who ordered the crime I mean there's been over a hundred arrests in this case do we know who actually said you know targeted these students in order to this to happen\nAccording would my investigation that there's a responsible these crime wise that twenty seven battalion anyone\nIn particular decorum than dead received a phone call from the rubble are\nAll dirty him you have to risk\nConsequences what if they said to to your findings\nEven now the Mexican government is an nagging you know they waste both peoples that day I mean they were present the real person that we're in both on that prime I'm not in yeah\n\nOn trial Snyder with these headlines President Trump says the we'll be talking soon but Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman speaking last night after a campaign rally in Nevada\nTrump said he needs to learn more about the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal ... Germany and France are calling Saudi Arabia's explanation incomplete authorities in Georgia and the middle of a manhunt they're searching for one of the suspects and yesterday's shooting death of a police officer and when that county a second suspect in custody\nAnd a couple of big lottery jak pops will be up for grabs this week a day after the huge mega millions jackpot went without a winter there was also do grand prize winner in last night's Powerball drawing on trial Snyder NPR News from Washington [noise]\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from pro quest as literature on line premium feature\nPro ... dot com [noise] and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more at alliance for lifetime income dot org\n[noise] if it's weekend edition from NPR News I'm the guy at the end of our world and it's time to play the puzzle [noise]\n\n\nJoining us as always is Will Shortz puzzle editor of the New York times and weekend edition puzzle master good morning well the burning Lulu your back from LA I'm back from LA I'm so go ahead and mind this is last week's challenge\nYou have to take the seven let her last name of a famous woman dropped illiteracy add an eye on an F\nAnd you can rearrange the result to get a word that famously describes this woman who issues and what's the word well the answer is Steinem as in Gloria Steinem and she was a feminist and how cool is that her name has all those letters\nVery cool um we had four hundred and thirty eight responses and the winner is dad panic tried out of metal is New York congratulations and look\nReally was it the dream [laughter]\nThis was this wonderful\nI I also heard you have a large collection of books as well\nYes Sam I collect Sherlock Holmes best dishes and novels and stories about a Conan Doyle um have roughly a just check this morning I have about a thousand now\nWow what draws you to Sherlock Holmes um\nThe the analytical thinking the way that he's able to you know analyze a problem from very little information\nWell I Hope you'll be able to analyze the question to the puzzle um are you ready to play I'm ready All right well take it away\nAll right then I'm going to give you two words think of a word that can follow my first one and pre said my second one in each case to complete a familiar two word phrase and the answer will rhyme with one of the two words\nFor example if I said snail and order you would say male as in snail mail and mail order and mail rhymes with smell and the rhyme can be for either the first or the second we're\nNumber one is legal and by the white film\nFreeze enough for the Cancun a hint\nTake just take off the constant as at the start\nOf legal eagle eagle eagle eagle\nEyes that okay you're often running number two is health and bear B.

European Union is looming and literally marching into the scene this weekend hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of London demanding a new Brexit referendum and another stay on the matter Charlotte Gallagher is in London and she joins us now she's a reporter for the BBC good morning\nUm say the organizers say there was about seven hundred thousand people that are in the metro simply say ... confirmed the numbers but says he's had hundreds of thousands of people by and that was well above what the organizes on the police and I think the media themselves expected\nAnd so a huge turnout from people rights across Britain and our ... she's coming down from\nScotland people flying in from Northern Ireland coming in from wells that even people from Europe to from Germany France and eight today that traveled to London for the march so you know some of the city's most famous street people marching past that would ban\nHas like been Brexit\nBrexit stole my future people wrapped up in e flags\nKind of children and buggies with e flags face paint on and it's kind of very British thing for people like to take the\nDog ... um that I Love dogs with that kind of dressed up in your outfit which they owe does on the radio and I I'm not the dog didn't look about happy about that but yeah lots of lots of don't garden as a\nReal of a lot of young people on the small city they're especially people that couldn't vote in the last referendum ... they were too young and they were the ones saying that what I being they think that being saddled with a mess basically which is\nI just got them and I'm agreed\nWell ... is another referendum even possible I mean we have these very chaotic negotiations um the prime minister they're really struggling to hammer out a deal um is a vote possible\nLegally if possible we could have\n... uh the prime minister Theresa May have said\nThat's not going to be another ... but that could be one technically however it would take months and months to find a second to get all the legislation in place and as you said at the beginning what a Brittany you to leave in March they probably if that was going to be some kind of people's votes it would have to then\nThe the day in March would have to be put back for the British Government would have to agree to that and all the other countries in the ... say twenty seven other countries yeah we'd have to agree to during that so it's a it's a big asking this amount of time reading\nThat the BBC's Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\nFor\nIn a little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns and that thing something coming\nLet's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave ah what do you think state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats\nAnd that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates\nDon't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats that any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin are two states that were really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases is purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle and if this\nNational wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the Democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats\nEven in the state that didn't as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have changed a lot of ah Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear\nIn a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nIs something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the sense of just coming up and twenty twenty so a lot of\nThe twenty twenty two elections Democrats were caught on the short side\nOr after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outside and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two

Navarro\nHead of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians expressed or suppressed their identities had come up this campaign season just look at Texas a and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival ... long used\nWas\nSo\nGruesome self hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nYour name is Raphael you know you go by\nEdge managed to upset the tractors and supporters\nOf the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU he's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized it we reached him earlier this week and ask him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can overuse identity that we can\nBring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em to seriously other many political context I'm the most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them as they should uh be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing\nThe role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talked about it without either alienating or collapsing [noise]\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly castle I I think you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down a terrible road\nBecause once you've created as a racial divisions it takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know all through the twenty century they're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind\nIt makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody of the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election\nA a real concern that identity and the politics around it it has been weaponized and and it's certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because of the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing losing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it it's about making sure that your base just satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common caught\nYes now the question is whether you can do that with our what your cold Radley recognizing identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything\nLies that bind rethinking identity thank you very much for your very much for\nAmerica's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooked they test tools

twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty states\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years\nAnd the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul dozens or dead but the vote went on and to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence\nKeep them away [noise] you know despite the threat from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only the numbers from the big cities and if the rural areas where people are most at threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by a policeman he detonated his explosive vest outside or in the new\n... says well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul abroad his armed men and he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced they arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around with the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seed in the parliament for each province are but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back\nAnd it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidate to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just briefly what is it signify that the vote was held after so\nThose were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going for with this vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision more than three million of eight point eight million registered voters coming out there trying to show that the that Afghanistan is making progress\nAs a battle insurgents around the country the Taliban are resurgent Islamic state was

Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had been under fire central Washington post columnist was killed\nAcross the region thanks for being with us my pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east is proving to be a loyalty talk to the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nClimbing governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of them issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and ah and king Solomon of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\n[laughter] you're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how it's affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis and I would say that they played it very smart uh they\nOur journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not a good beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically defending a you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really extracting I think an important\nImportant important price from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why exposed Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated Dutch\nUh they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange the need to invest in it they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\n... and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this\nI Believe for a U.S government who wants to sanction next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was best known many a political scientist at the University of Waterloo

Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of why\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very flea blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well the higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist ... hadn't and this has published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they Mexican Government said that they\nThree hours after everything and be seized official store to eat what I have seen all these years four years of investigation is that all the official ... is our ally is not true its ally\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the for the police not just where not about wild west ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just east\nEven more I had reports on the

on the buses disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if they do this we're targeting inside bus that's why that it was just too I'm not so the ...\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would that do both states where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside enough secret parts of the of the boss the secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students ... for the army and if the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what these west that are really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus [noise]\nI was able to connect with one drug lord important drug lord I was able to contact with one person that works for him and glass these uh informant and inside

those explanations and seem difficult to believe but the president wants to give the kingdom the benefit of the doubt with a kind of allow that\nWell the Senate needs to have a a very intense discussion about this because uh basically President Trump is giving a sense that this was a credible story this half ... half baked story ah they um instead of sending a powerful message about America\nHand in hand with the Saudi Government to take a very serious situation and try to dismiss it\nWhat should the response the what should not powerful message me\nAll the message to start by saying this story is completely unacceptable it's full of every kind of a whole not given it any sort of of credibility and that we have to get to the bottom of everything that that happened\nSecond is we need to realize that this is this is one piece of a broader set of issues we have to address a prior to the incident in the consulate the Saudis were using an intense a team of folks on Twitter to discredit crush hoagie and and other dissidents or around the world\nAnd furthermore they are involved in this or a horrific war in Yemen where we are actually assisting them and this is a a

on the streets of London demanding a new Brexit referendum and another stay on the metro Charlotte Gallagher is in London and she joins us now she's a reporter for the BBC the morning\nMoaning uh so tell me about this demonstration and put it into context was this a surprising turn out for a ...\nOn say the organizers said I was about seven hundred thousand people that\nAnd the ... confirmed the numbers but sets and they are he's at hundreds of thousands of people that and that was well above what the organizes on the police and I think the media themselves expected\nAnd so a huge China from people rights across Britain and our ... she's coming down from Scotland people flying in from Northern Ireland coming in it for a while is that even people from your effort to from Germany from an ... traveled to London for the much that you know some of the city my\nFamous street people marching past that would ban is like in ... that Brexit\nStole my future people wrapped up in e flags kind of children in ... with ... face paint on and it's kind of very British thing or two people\nAbout happy about that but yeah lots of lots of talk and as a real a lot of young people on the small city they're specially people that couldn't vote in the last referendum ... they were too young\nAnd they were the ones saying that what I being they think that being saddled with a mess basically which is severely affecting ... so a lot of them are really pushing for these people buy on any kind of Brexit deal the British Government um agreed\nWell ... is another referendum even possible I mean we have these very chaotic negotiations um the prime minister they're really struggling to hammer out a deal um is a vote possible\nSo legally if possible we could have ... uh the prime minister Theresa May have said\nThat's not going to be another ... but that could be one technically however it would take months and months to plan a second ... she got older legislation in place and as you said at the beginning what a ... to leave in ... they probably weren't going to be some kind of people that I Would have to ban\nThe the day in March would have to be put back so the British Government would have to agree to that\nAnd all the other countries in the ... say twenty seven other countries yeah we'd have to agree\n\nAnd little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns\nAnd I think something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash scheduled I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hell welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave at what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats\nAnd that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with\nBut if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be ... and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run\nThe say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats that any other level\nLet's talk about two states where\nCases it purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nConnecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house but if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that didn't as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes or\nThat's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the fence which is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the ... the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here if the elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you forty\nYears ago this Sunday Morning America was

Americans say that the two parties fail to adequately represent the American people according to a recent nonpartisan survey a Colorado based group called unite America is trying to use that dissatisfaction to elect more independent candidates to office nationwide\nFrom Colorado Public radio bend to Brooklyn report\nYou make America wants to galvanize voters like Anthony Corrado keep a Democrat but since he'd absolutely back an unaffiliated candidate if he agreed with their policies\nEdition if anything the last presidential election has proven that\nBoth parties in many ways are flaws the leadership and those parties\nStill think the chance that he would ultimately vote for someone who was an affiliated is pretty plans\nBecause there's a high likelihood that I might not even know that that person exist and that's the thing is that you don't know they exist how can you go for that and how are you getting messages\nThat were unite America it's trying to fill the void\nThey've helped a handful of Colorado State how candidates qualify for the ballot campaign and get their name dealt with promotional video their endorsing twenty four unaffiliated candidate running for all levels of office from across the country the group recently held a national climate for it\nAnd in mind that will resonate with voters who are frustrated\nAnd looking for change everybody wants to put you in a box they want you to stand in a box or they can clearly defined what are you are but that's the problem faces that we're trying to solve complex issue with very black and white college in states\nLike Colorado unaffiliated voters now outnumber both Republicans and Democrats but many of those than affiliated voters actually can only vote was one party or the other\nThan more than a hundred years since Colorado elected and unaffiliated candidate to the legislature Nick ... is the executive director of the night America\nHe believes the purple states like Colorado with narrowly divided legislature is the perfect place to launch the movement\nShould just two or three or four independents could have a transformative impact if no party had an outright majority that catches ram their agenda through they would need to reach across the aisle for some votes\nBut it's got the goal unite America in fielding candidates in the right race is full control of either of Colorado chambers regardless of whether or not their candidates win any races in Colorado or across the country Dick Wadhams the former head of the state Republican Party\nIdentify with the party if some democratic candidates and also in competitive seats they must be responsible for some Democrats will say\nOne question about the group at how much it donors are spending a top democratic

Oakland\nAhead of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians expressed or to press their identities had come up this campaign season just look at Texas a and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz when after a Hispanic nickname his rival Beto O'Rourke has long used\n\nSo\nGruesome self hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nFor your name is Raphael you know you go by cared at an angle sized version of it here what the other way\nJust this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to\nAncestry courtesy of a newly revealed the NHL\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU he's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized we reached him earlier this week and ask him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can overuse identity we can bring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and in many political contacts um\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should uh be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best the one on the ground so you have to balance it out\n[noise] the world\nSay I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly castle I I think you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently during\nIs mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down a terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know we'll through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Moscow",
