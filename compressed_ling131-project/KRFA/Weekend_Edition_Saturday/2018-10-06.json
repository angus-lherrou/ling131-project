need to confirm it at is expected to mentor conservative majority\nTo tutor Stevens black men Kennedy who he issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court but uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact for generations could\nOh yes we assume the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents do named Bush out to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been er which has been a growing forest on the court for

somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let's underscored there's nothing remotely secret about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population um\nIf Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination\nOf of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized to get out to the polls about a month from now or do many feel\nMission accomplished there could be both a feeling of accomplishment and a feeling of opportunity to press further\nAnd some resentment over the confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut midterms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls

to be on a clear path to be confirmed for the Supreme Court but the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted\nBlasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed a diversity of views [laughter] which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian blushing forward now with the ...\nI mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes\nOr perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with that as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirm me 'cause I think that this Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nOut there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the ... did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't a I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy require\nThink hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically choose the crowd I wasn't aware of the fact because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand and Seventeen two dozen Eighteen to should\nPeople there basically to because of cooperation where her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists now to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\nBut let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's energy from Christine Blasey Ford a sincere a boat that she couldn't let a charge that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support ... a judge now the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual\nAnd outraged and defended not to be believed you know I think that it's a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo can than you'd end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have necessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent ... uh until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt [noise]\nAnd you don't inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in about three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shame list and totally undeserved from\nLocked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ... making the cardinals thanks so much think you can do to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation\nThe art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you got is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily the head of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters\nAre a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump passed on several hundred million dollars\nWords that Trump's probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald ... over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale is his dependence on his father was really pretty bare and that story so that's another\nImportant theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father went in ...\nIs distinctly illegal [noise] [noise] yeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who actually low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending an equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings\nSo they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is\nThe statute of limitations has passed on much of it so it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think\nReally will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps\nAny he earned his living on his own rather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple\nThis week a report by Bloomberg said the Chinese government operative spotted microchips especially
