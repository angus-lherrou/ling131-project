the national anthem was beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency [noise] interested in whether it football players took her new you're not during the plane or the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like health care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think\nNational anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain what did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well what we found was these tweets had gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump give a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us\nKneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influences the conversation\n... so it it it wasn't direct TV in a certain result just to just er things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go

correct\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the

world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ed these days it's not negative am I just watching the wrong spaces\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ...\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\n[noise] you know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing that cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\nYes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's\nThis year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season on through [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are a lot of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being connected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people in in question should be raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nYeah this is a tough one to decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is that an all time high\nPolitical advertising is a reflection of the polarization and the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television has to make an appeal to an electorate where you want\nIndependence or swing voters and you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us my pleasure\nAnd Tamara weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other you can listen to that story

Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was absolutely riveting and and stunning Eighteen pitchers used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night\nAs a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball a does is anybody left to throw the game tonight [laughter]\nWell the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still hadn't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used that pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan evolving Scott six innings in relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max monthly ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer regattas a dealer builders by God he was a brilliant this with two games you know literally was tonight in and games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star or he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team has ever come back in the world series from a three hour deficit Walker below goes that he throws seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox lineup [noise]\nThe Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker bealer being the start\nAnd then I does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win\n... that's a good question to ask either of these teams got because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but both teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out\nA way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now

backed Internet research agency to use Twitter bucked the influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trust\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency [noise] interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this\nWas an issue that reached the top of\nThe food chain what did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets had begun all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement then we saw it\nReally a tax the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second thing if you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA failing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players\nSo it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... so it it it wasn't directing achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraud contentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose to him pretty red meat from pretty rabid fans too\nYou know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall

pumpkin spice in the world series\nScience at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us my pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political at these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV [noise]\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen but one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV\nAnd so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more\nYeah so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line\nAnd there's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season on through [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being connected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions are being raised about the tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these uh\nThis is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high\nPolitical advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll state has a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle vote set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who's co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us my pleasure and it's where all weekend edition Sunday literally looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other\nYou can listen to that story tomorrow morning by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name\nAnd [noise]\nAnd it's time for sports [noise]\nThe longest game and World Series history and we're still\nGoing on [noise] Eighteen innings seven hours ... minutes is longer than the plane time of the entire Nineteen thirty nine World Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers one three to walk home or by max Muncie\nIn the bottom of the Eighteenth Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there are men are you there your weight yeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game\nUnbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I I watched um [noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen through Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteen pictures used by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best pitcher on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter it isn't even throw the ball a does is anybody left to throw the game tonight\nWell the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still hadn't decided who he's starting later today and game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him\nHe was tonight in game and for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and asked to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team has ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker below goes that he throws seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and their grave reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with water bill or being the start\nOf the night does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win\n... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but both teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now\nAnd uh it's fun Tom Goldman thanks so much You're welcome the deal Bob Cousy and bill Russell was one of the greatest they were to Tracy ...\nIf they won six championships for the Boston Celtics and the Nineteen fifties and sixties and but just a dynasty that would win eight in a

turbulent times of the civil rights movement and in Boston roiled by bigotry Gary ... the historian journalist has written a book about the cousy Russell partnership and the regrets one of them has about plays that maybe he didn't make\nIt ... the last past cousy Russell the Celtics and what matters in the end [noise]\nGary ... joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us great
