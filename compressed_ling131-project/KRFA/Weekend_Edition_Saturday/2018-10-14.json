it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRick Scott was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over ah both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far that guy\nWith ... pretty hard it was hit yeah a Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the uh the\nThe county of Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent round the census for

congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it couldn't name and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state
