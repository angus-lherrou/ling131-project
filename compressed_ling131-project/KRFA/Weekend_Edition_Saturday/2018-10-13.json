water here we are working on getting food here they\nBut working on getting hot heat that we understand the basic needs\nHundreds of thousands are without power from the Florida Panhandle into Virginia the storm is now blamed for at least fourteen deaths NPR's Joel Rose in Miramar Beach Florida Joel thanks for being with us Hi Scott what is the situation seem like today\nWell as you mentioned there are lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power and no gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations do have gas or very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it is getting increasingly difficult just to find the basics like to find food and and to find water\nAnd you were in Panama City yesterday I gather which which would like they're\n[noise] it's a small city about thirty seven thousand residence 'em before the storm on it's on the bay it's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico it's not a luxurious town I mean the houses are set pretty close together\nAnd right now it's like every block is is that almost like a scene from a disaster movie like you their trees down there are wires in the street seems like every buildings to stay in some kind\n... right out into the the blue sky outside um churches schools public buildings hospitals all of this and sustained a lot of damage a and I think it's starting to really down and folks to this is going to be a very long recovery\nRight now fourteen the deaths or fourteen people had been reported and confirmed but I gather nobody there are things such as that is the final word\nUnfortunately no I mean I I think people do think that the death toll is likely to rise up so far officials here have been pretty tight lipped they don't want to release numbers until they finished the search and rescue process a bay county emergency chief mark bowing was asked yesterday about the number of fatalities here's what he said\nWhat we have is a lot of people missing I Want to be very careful about numbers because are they missing because their loved ones can't contact them or are they missing because they were you know perished in the storm\nAnd when you said loved ones are missing or can contact them it's a it's true that cell phones are not working very well not only in Panama City but all over bay county so it remains really difficult to communicate and find relatives who may have stayed behind in the storm\nBut still you do get the feeling that the number of fatalities is going to go up and maybe way up when we start to get more information from the

over his role in covering up two different church sexual abuse scandals the first\nIn Pennsylvania was detailed and a nine hundred page report in August that outlines sexually abused by priests in six dioceses over which were all presided he was also accused of covering up allegations against his predecessor D.C.'s cardinal Theodore ... character who resigned from the College of cardinals earlier this year [noise]\nThese are unsettling time for many of us Catholics\nHe joins us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here tell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe in most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nIt hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these ... that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was\nActually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion and then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about than\nWhat I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever that newspapers broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\n... and a church or face [noise]\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith\nI'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church mash did you grow up\nWith anyone do you know anyone who uh\nWho has their own story to tell no I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about it shelters ... and less about the people who had been\nHarmed [noise] it certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of this abuse thing bishops been people whose names are plastered up on church buildings back in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for it\nPreserving their own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care\n[noise] do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with because of the Catholic Church is is all I ever\nWas involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area and starting a new\nA new part of my life and then the breaking of all of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I still have a face and I just seen much less of

incredible model\nA sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I\nThink her from my ride all the practice that I still have now\nBut that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we go to the outside\nWorld your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not\nMake much money she was dealing with what I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looked at me because when I Would face\nWorst and I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to give her aggressively worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the baby in June to read from your mother debating the tree endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that it's just want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of particular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think let me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kids so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding um [noise]\nAny new eventually I started to start as a way of attempt in the hot and the symptom to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of ...\nMore than two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of run ins with police\nI was about to get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be OK lead people wouldn't see me as such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah [laughter] then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life oh man\nI'm by the time my body broke my body literally broke from overused and wrote from not asleep and it broke from not eating\nThe only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date until another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nYou are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nShame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through\nMy gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the lotto myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home next to ours feeling absolutely like trash\nAnd I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the\nHardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling both as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nI Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother not love me enough to instill a practice\nThe reading and writing to say and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer Norman American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better we can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly

conventional vote fraud as we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is it a complaint that show rights groups are making\nThe group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was this settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republican or in the ... the Republican control\nYou know this exact match protocol it's really

storm is now blamed for at least fourteen deaths NPR's Joel Rose in Miramar Beach Florida Joel thanks for being with us Hi Scott what does this situation seem like today\nWell as you mentioned there are lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power and no gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations do have gas there very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it is getting increasingly difficult just to find the basics like to find food and and to find water\nOn it's on the bay it's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico that's not a luxurious town I mean the houses are set pretty close together\nAnd right now it's like every block is is that almost like a scene from a disaster movie like their trees down there are wires in the street seems like every buildings to stay in some kind of damage\nOr either to the roof or to the wall I mean I saw a church that was missing two of its walls and and you could just be from the pews right out into the the blue sky outside um church's school public buildings hospitals all of this and sustained a lot of damage or and I think it's starting to really dawned on folks that this is going to be a very long recovery\nRight now fourteen the deaths of fourteen people had been reported and confirmed but I gather nobody there are things such as that the final word\nUnfortunately no I mean I think people do think that the death toll is likely to rise so far officials here have been pretty tight lipped they don't want to release numbers until they finished the search and rescue process a bay county emergency chief mark bowing was asked yesterday about the number of fatalities here's what he said\nWe have is a lot of people missing I Want to be very careful about numbers because are they missing because their loved one\nAttack them it's a it's true that cell phones are not working very well not only in Panama City but all over bay county so it remains really difficult to communicate and find relatives who may have stayed behind in the storm\nBut still you do get the feeling that the number of fatalities is going to go up and maybe way up when we start to get more information from the waterfront communities\nOr you know to the south and east of Panama City places like Springfield Parker Mexico beach in Port saint Joe that were really hit hard by the storm I

here tell us about your faith which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life is all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nIt hurt reading the report because I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up\nActually uh anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion and then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about than\nWhat I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever that newspapers broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing it wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it it's on ... and a church or face [noise]\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe in the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell you know I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with do you think the church cared more about it shelters ... and less about the people who had been harmed\n[noise] it certainly seems like that to me and that's one\nThe the release of disabuse seeing bishops than people whose names are plastered up on church buildings back in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abused there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care\n[noise] do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with because of the Catholic Church is is all I ever\nWas involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area and starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking all of these news stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God

from Oxford, Mississippi thanks so much for being with us\nThank you so much for wanting to talk to you [noise]\nWhen someone says do you tell me about your mouth or it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it to my mother's a incredible model and like\nMost Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patches\nShe had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em\nBefore I could do anything I wanted to my entire life I think her from my ride all the practice that I still have now but that readily practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gap an all out of the chair that I think she\nProbably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we go\nTo the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black one\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not\nMake much money she was dealing with what I Would call like shards of abuse\nAnd you know when I was around nine or ten she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looked at me because when I Would face or police or why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to give progressive Lee worse and\nI think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother debating the she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOf the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of particular\nBut it is so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women have to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em an individual you started to start as a way of attempt in the high in ... in a disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police\nUs about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be OK lead people wouldn't see me as such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah [laughter] then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life oh man\nI'm by the time and my body broke my body literally broke from overused ... wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating\nAnother day probably for like six years went to a casino and it was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in that book\nBecause you were implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWhile I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame\nWhen we show people and tell people that\nThe money that we are able to make we are unable to cheap right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind\nOf like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experienced in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't really honestly\nI think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks oh\nI Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother and not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believed that reading and writing to say\nAnd I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better we can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together

showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up but just over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters the groups you're showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also\nWhat are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nTo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for air there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases to basically works like this right you have [noise]\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker input the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application it's frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote by you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can do vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about I'm not just conventional vote fraud as we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that\nHe's disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under camps office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republican or in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law in his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has meant\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she does everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy\nI'm On the other side Kemp campaign that this is just a manufactured crisis uh but for both candidates motivating debates is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not
