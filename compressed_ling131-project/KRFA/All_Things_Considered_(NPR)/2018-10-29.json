forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders and the U.S that this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or there were only in a support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen Seventy is and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nSome of them will be armed do they say those who would normally\nAs far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico

Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years that Philips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remain\nWho killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well bowler says it was the feds wrong persistent focused on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo ... says
