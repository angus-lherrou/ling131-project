he's saying that\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally poses a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country that Tom not letting them in\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty four for ... or from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that\nGroup ah there's no evidence then as Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nIllegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign\nHe has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\nThe\n\nCommon sense [noise]\nThird on that Leslie was that tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republican thought would be the first thing that that tax cut they passed in

headlines this election year in Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id to include street addresses and also gotten attention\nUse Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we said states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea\nUm some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business um\nWhat we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting ... from the role that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that\nAre on the roll them cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has been voted into into recycled or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as the administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late\nUm critically were also saying that purging is happening in states that used to\nBe required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\nUm even calling this voter suppression\nLaws around voting up\nMany of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned sort of an hour it's aren't seeing it as depression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota\nSo some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form a many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote surprised are very very resilient and very
