I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Jordan parents are from Mexico and um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws\nBut I think this is a country and opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them I ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position\nWho want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThat sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House it's something you hear a lot from Arizona Republican who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug ... who's running for reelection to the or against the Latino candidates\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nUse the if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug ... on the ballot edits Doug do she's agenda\nDo the hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who the former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as to approach do the for the job because the I think over the past\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for the is not suggesting on border security that we need to stop them for you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juicy\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who said immigration the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way pita\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat us in\nOur film it gives you got to vote you got to go to ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over there over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republican to separate\nTrump [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered on northwest public broadcasting because have you with us oh program support comes from listeners like you and from lamb who's brewery\nCreators of ... death a beer made with locally sourced coffee Irish death and cocoa a proud supporter of in W.

S. and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis for the United states with Saudi Arabia which has been a strong ally for generations Bruce\nI think that Saudi Arabia is aware that they really matched up here um you know they've\nArrested I think it was Fifteen people in the last hour they announced that they were up to those and just met five others\nBut I think that they have a change of the latest statement from Saudi state TV yeah so I think it's clear that they're taking it seriously and they should be taking this seriously um I think that they definitely need to you know rethink what they're doing and the way that they are going to treat American permanent residents that are living in their country\nEJ I'm lost tortillas thoughts\nAs a suggestion that as well

events to the journalists were killed after a fight broke out between him an unnamed people inside the consulate\nNPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nSaturday acknowledgement of ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin Salman they note that the Saudis took more than two\nThey have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day to show you arrived at the consulate there are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body President Trump said he found the Saudi account of what happened credible\nHe also said the fight an accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he

California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he would taser several times Mr Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby it's Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London but the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss\nBack to this [noise] it absolutely was I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother as he takes three three hundred and thirty pounds I'm it fits the general reporting on these kinds of thing when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it it has been shown that these offices\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to Iraq and without harming him um it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrest for black men in particular versus Iraq for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described it six foot three and three hundred pounds of some of those ... those are factual detailed though aren't they I mean if you were to Robin someone wouldn't you describe those things you\nMight not have sampled you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that would never mentioned often their market that designate black people as others so as deeply as ... as intimidating as particularly threatening\n[noise] it's been reported that your brother's struggled with a mental health issues with that is that accurate\nTo support the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police\nTo to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor and says well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection out they don't see that the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think the ticket and I think I Know statistics show academy between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this would come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to the\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be\nPeople reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who I'm saddened by the ... story they needed to be told\nThat about a a Kobe she's the sister of CIA naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being paid by the time a tale county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nWe said earlier police conduct towards civilian particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life that happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she took it for her home and of course apple ... is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone\nAt Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students and they watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police a traffic stop please\n\nAll\n... states senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with my pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that end up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement during traffic stops and I guess Philando Castile do is kind of the tip of iceberg for me\nIt's still end up kind of steel is an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to\nAt least to find a baby or expectations of citizens and police officers and what's lost here is that people thinking the legislation Jess focus on citizens will it does and it doesn't just focus on our video\nA video camera sets the stage for additional course content for both the citizen and also police and police academies\nWhat will be expected of that police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to you\nSort of a primer the video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the text to what appeared to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video\nIs as a primer you know if we need to go back and makes it makes it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in your your fat I Can't\nForgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that used to spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tens and why would you\nMeasure let me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have\nExpectations are citizens and make certain citizens know what their rights or I thought put that in schools and making the mandatory\nWas a great place to put it also also driver's license courses and also the police department of police academies and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nWell but the question I think some people might have is the question the conduct of the drivers or if the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nI think it's a combination of both how do we make certain that there is\nThat deals with that biased piece how do we make certain that in police departments that they have psychological examinations that Fred out that um conscience buys or an instance is try to erase as best possible goodbyes ... I'm not sitting there saying that this is\nGoing to be the parents here because it's not it's not\nBut I think that it's a step in the right direction in order to make certain that we know what the behavior expectations are\n[noise]\n\n[noise] I'm Janine hurts with these headlines President Trump today says he isn't satisfied with Saudi Arabia's response to the death of journalists Jamal ... show\nMexican authorities of a lot of second group of about forty five migrants to be processed at the border with Guatemala and have started giving some people forty five day visitor permits Mexico's only allowing those with a visa or a passport in others are applying for refugee status in Mexico\nAustralia center right government is lost one seat majority in parliament in a ... election in Sydney today and independent candidate has prevailed I'm Janine hurts NPR News in Washington [noise]\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build a more just and equitable world learned more at age eight W.

touted successes\nAnd while you've probably heard about the federalist society Israel and doing that that the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices\nAnother group has also played a key role and the project and that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC this week the New York times wrote about his secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and they all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secrets and find something of a loyalty oath [laughter] New York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now could spend it\nAfter his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us from going to be here though what what the stated purpose of this program how was it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction but you spoke with some\nThey may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar but there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and I'm going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that a bit like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts are kind of indoctrination\nA law clerk is an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties on to run to the judicial system into their judges and not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat can turn here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn is\nPromised to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo they're all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipeline fraternity sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um the Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at that [noise]\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it did represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program has been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy worth the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not\nFine and when his heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually bending the program what else did they say\nThey have been very close mouthed about it or tried them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who the donors were they stood sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating\nWhich suggests that perhaps they might try to reconstituted in a different form it's entirely possible years that's

its star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try and spin off called the Connors which for me or this week and ... we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a

critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough social commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you see it\nYou know it's really interesting because any time a sitcom has to actually address issues that are Frank\nBetween the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide the inside right and in this case one of the things that was really strange to me is that\nOne of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of racist tweet that got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that\nThat you know medication and essentially led to this behavioral change so there is a weird tension in some ways uh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior Medicaid or not in the real world is our culture guy though what did you think of the episode just as briefly as yeah\nI Know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the president of the absence of Roseanne was was powerful so uh I I thought they did a pretty good job actually addressing it very difficult topic [laughter]\nI Know you're not a critic but you're deeply immersed in covering this crisis okay and I just wondered if you felt about it that the person who knows a lot about the reality of the situation\n[noise] um I started I didn't see the show as a matter of fact I was speaking in rural Ohio a one
