things considered\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I note that Chang and I'm Mary Louise\nKelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in to town Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida or Easter industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now\nFall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove in today my producer Becky Sullivan I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses resist in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as it were there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just\nPoint together that was damaged now open to single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in ... no power no ... very limited cell service in no outside help you\nWhile and and I mentioned these two towns are the hardest waster industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and ... they were struggling before the storm how might this effect them\nRight I mean ... along the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most boats escape major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage or working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\n[laughter] as NPR's Greg Allen reporting for us to from Florida Today and all this week Greg thanks so much you walk them All right let's move now to the political storm that

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson\nBut after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies end Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nTo us that the charges were baseless\nBut he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why him and why really can now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey and of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the Glenn\nWho lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in\nThis a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you\nHouse arrest then the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is to release the pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement ... the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue of the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that for instance has an evangelical pastor that says that's his church that it was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey\nWill lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing his stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of

the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nHe was brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they're the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley with at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn in the middle of writing that\nI came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag of free throws has gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written but corn futures had fallen twelve percent since ... so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why our ship getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one free does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi ... which makes ... in fact the vending machine got you did in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know\nWeeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so presumably wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nHow naive to think that's all that's in a bag of free to Carolyn Dmitri it's an applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices care that much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos ... and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine\nMight suddenly cost a lot more we took the shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma below capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies\nHe's a low minimum um because of the parent has gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum and you can [noise] yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with over ... she's aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf all the companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs maybe Pepsi or coke and just raise the price of their drinks to offset there's more expensive can but they can't really do that right now they own so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nFracking is growing category unlike many of the other food categories and bad allows companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can do their do trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks that's our best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the\nOr Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter] [noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with safety Danny Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cats the indicator from Planet Money [noise] support for Planet Money comes from the transfer why\nA service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to bend receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore at transfer wise dot com or from their ass [noise]\nThis is all Fritos considered from NPR News [laughter]\nThe Internet researchers amassed the identities of the Russians who were poisons poisons several people in the u._k. and they're eager to share their methods\nWe firmly believe that it's so important to more people are aware of how to do this kind of things I'm most of the times it's not too hard\nTo learn more on how they were able to track down the criminals at five forty\nAll the blue San Louis Clark valley a dry cold front tonight brings brings the conditions into Saturday when us up to twenty five miles per hour otherwise through the weekend and much of next week if you can expect sunny days clear nights and dry weather with possible\nThank you to everyone who supports northwest public broadcasting and a warm welcome I'll give you a big hug\nThat is likely so they would ... says I'm visa ...\nTo a guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge told her works for group called spelling cat\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works tolerant as friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese airbases watch security operation some fold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy's you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy the trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise] when you look\nAt these photos on there on our on our website because it's\nWall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis is a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person up all of the photo shows are boy ...

come back we're going to go to ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletic she industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball with him\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed just one clear and been quarter and the deal that broke her after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nThese elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so of course that's a big part of the appeal\nWhat's happening in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and it also is a complex thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nHow much pool do they have now to get a big name behind him\nAfter ...\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I did a lot of research last year Nike had about ... percent of the leak wearing their shoes lassie oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough mind okay [laughter] yeah they do have\nThey do have a huge budget in allowing from corporate standpoint and they signed sixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an old aren't into mark his cousin so you\nKnow in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble in there for a company like ... at the market already pretty saturated among shot to get back into the basketball she didn't\nIncredibly aggressive um the ... is a big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media if you've gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have said could see that in ... made a kind of fun\nHere's component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching lots and lots of folks who our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that poll assigned\nHave six and a half million to bind followers on Instagram so that's a huge base as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really leaning in on their players accounts and ethical big part of their strategy with their shoes that they don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n... covers the athletic she industry for ESPN taint the nights Nick ... thanks

you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him\nWhat do you think of that characterization by the pope I think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop we're all played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current catch up limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat whether it's back to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witness did pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by\nDon't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe\nAnd the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward\nWe shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare in how a large institution in the Catholic Church but there's so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse to protect abusers\nDoes reviving this statute of limitations get it that we did actually increased the accountability internally at the ... and\nYou hit the nail on the heads so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs\nOf the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there is our reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and I think you're seeing across the\nAnd being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable in law enforcement plays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJosh superhero in Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you [noise]\nSome of the last

there were senators and members of Congress and secretary of state Mike Pompeo oh who had worked to secure brunt\nThe president and prayed that that President Trump be given supernatural wisdom well what led up to this whole moment yet so pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\n... air to one uh he had been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course\nUm there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department and especially vice president Mike Pence worked a lot on this case um Brunson was moved in July to house arrest\nThen that wasn't enough President Trump was not happy about it and in August to impose sanctions on turkey to try to force the release a Bronx and um that released came on friday\nA and he arrived at joint base Andrews earlier today\nDoes it mean anything for the relationship between

we called up mark nice the heat the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program thanks driving with All right so why were these voter applications put on

Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and\nPolicy of the secretary of state's office for several years to um put

other states have this kind of law including Florida\nAnd in Florida any way of federal court upheld their law\nAnd activists are saying that it's like it's proportionally affecting minority voters

... be ... his opponents say that Brian ... is\nPart of this process as secretary of state he's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close we have seen that there are these voters on\nPending lists and we have seen Georgia Pass a photo ID law before you can vote however in Georgia the way our elections work as the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing\n... elections and enforcing state laws regarding the elections\nMost of election processes are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easy to vote and follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we reported that Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including\nWell over two hundred thousand new voters just in the may primary election\nWhat mood in Georgia right now it's still close the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and does\nOn voting rights and Republicans are saying that it's a

Love\nMaking God my that all the time like\nOff and make you feel like super ...\nYou probably heard those comments from Kanye West in the oval office\nAnd the firestorm of reaction after but Kanye wasn't the only celebrity catching heat this week Taylor with was to for her Instagram endorsement of two Democrats running for office in Tennessee\nHer home state and we've got a few people joining us to talk about this test is Stewart is the politics reporter at Rolling Stone she's in Hudson New York Julie a craven of the huff post is on the line from Washington D. C. and last but not least\nRight now I'm gonna start with you because I Know at some point you were a big ... fan maybe you still are um and we know he's always been provocative he's always been unpredictable but this was on another level and it was in the oval office what was your reaction to what went down on Thursday\nIt was so surreal dislike I'm taking a scene from from get out or something I don't know but I was a fan and once upon a time you noticed downward spiral ... has been happening for a couple of years so what happened this week especially after the past year was not that much of a surprise\nBut as easy as it is to kind of laugh about it and imagine it as some kind of entertaining thing I think we've got to take this seriously I think it's really dangerous\nThe kind of rhetoric that he is spitting out and I I feel like in a lot of ways he is a reflection of Trump as a candidate in twenty states scene and it was really easy to laugh about 'em into election night you know\n... ... what do you think I mean is now the time to be taking ... seriously\nIf you haven't been taking ... seriously you should start taking him seriously now um [noise] I agree with everything right and he just said this is not performance art he's not doing this\nRacism wasn't a deal breaker for him and\nAs a former ... myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people\nAfter the fallout from Hurricane Katrina so I completely agree with Rodney we need to take this seriously this is a man who has reach yet fans his fans follow him they're influenced by him and he is supporting a president that is arguably just blatantly races\nBecause I'm going to do this next question to you Taylor Swift also got some heated reaction to her backing to Democrats in Tennessee for people who haven't heard\nTests can you can you tell us what happened what she did on Sunday night she posted a photograph of herself to Instagram and and the caption she talked about the fact\nThat she was coming out for the first time and vocalizing her political beliefs she endorsed two candidates in Tennessee Phil Bredesen who is a candidate for the Senate he's the former governor of Tennessee and Jim Cooper who's a sitting congressman up for re election in November\nBut the main thrust of her Instagram post was about why she's not voting for Marsha Blackburn who's a female candidate in the race she said she likes to support for women who are running for office but she couldn't support\nFive Republicans were not happy with her right Mike Huckabee tweeted something about her fan being too young to vote so oh well so what but I mean there was a lot of negative reaction from high profile Republicans\nThere was a negative reaction but it wasn't as strong as for instance Trump has been to criticism in the past he said I like Taylor's music twenty five percent less now um which is really like not that damning of a of a combination\nAnd Mike Huckabee said you know she's entitled to her political beliefs but it's not going to matter and less Thirteen year old girls are voting in which was very dismissive of um Taylor's reach which is a lot broader than just Thirteen year old girls at this point but\nWhat about her her fans who are Republican just regular fan not high profile\nIt's hard to say because the timing of this announcement was right after her reputation tore ended so we don't have a sense of whether that would impact\nTicket sales at this point or\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines

of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who object to find women who's a former cop who admitted to using you know prostitute and ...\nLooking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth in value are determined by my appearance than my marketability\nI'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so\n... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling for me\nWhat has forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning you that's now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in queuing day or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me to experience this that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know the it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I had these wild

in a context that was obviously just as Texas says the rest of the culture but in hip hop there were definitely this base that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and\nSo looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that human body whether they say to you oh my gosh it's only saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this act sandwiches my accent which was my real accent\n... can you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the God goddesses and ... of the theater\nAnd of accent than you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman and the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I have a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family\nBut also that I Want\nSo what you know the I Love kind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then present it to those people first I always hang every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so in the show ... went to the United nations schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of walking out some of this material\nOn during the different places are that are a lot of conversations about sex walk or prostitution or commercial sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said but he good cracking good job\nShe's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really try to set my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says\nI feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this I'll say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nI think like so many of us in today\nSide my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives that people who you meet in my shows are these
