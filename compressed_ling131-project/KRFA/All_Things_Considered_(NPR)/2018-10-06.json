I think that response which had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred ups\n... is absolutely right they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nAt that this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nRally foreign shore I one\nBrett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice\nThat well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut Tibet specific remark he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics of some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases right\nMoment in his to the op ed that he published last night and the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there are some things they shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to senator ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that [noise]\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I Do not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout

forest as all grown up and blended there are some critters still making a living in that landscape and it has nowhere near the variety of the former landscape before it was a modernized\nToday's thick forests combined with a warming climate also set the stage for mega fires the result is to starkly contrasting landscapes and the dynamic far different from the one native animals involved with gains says the loss of that varied habitat for creatures like the candidate links has been devastating\nLinks recovery is either made are are not here in this part of Washington this is the largest

into wetlands and streams that encourages rich Quil dining rooms for everything from gear to fish\nNo one is advocating that we let all fires burn freely especially the human caused ones but the

think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the pro and con the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback\n... you know ignored yet

he's with us now from Capitol Hill Scott welcome thanks so much for joining us show the first of all set the scene for us for people who are not able to watch it\nYou know these votes are one of the

amid hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis this has all been so\nPartisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you have a sense of this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just listen to some of today's concluding speeches Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii So is this is another case of a woman being ignored\nThat's what I Am left with Mr President anger Harry this guy\nThat could not see the truth of what Dr for I Try to tell us\nAnd Republicans feel like this has been character assassination from day one here's John Cornyn\nI Am disappointed\nMore than I can say those who have been leashed these unjustified attacks on the judge and his family and disappointed than their lack of any empathy\nOver Morris brought they had put them through\nWell let let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and it's got because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine positive for since the are incredible and yet\nIn strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing that Ford was since here that's a word that kept coming up\nThey said they believed that something happened to her but either that they didn't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the one who assaulted her\nOr that they just didn't see any evidence backing for it up on that claim that was the final view from Susan Collins of Maine when she made that speech yesterday insurance Kavanaugh would be appointed a confirmed to the court that there were no corroborating accounts more questions than not\nSo and then we have the same result as Nineteen Ninety One when Anita Hill testified about Clarence Thomas a woman comes forward with allegations and the man she accused ends up on the Supreme Court let's talk\nAbout sort of more

trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh\nNow we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kevin assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they had been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country is tremendous I'm not certain she has a sense of that yet the the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but but certainly what she has done a has\nUnleash something that is going to move this country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter a have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story ... what does professor ...\n... has been and ... and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision can make an informed decision with all the facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nFBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information\nAnd so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting their vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect\nOn both parties I made it there's some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms than they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things but there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that [noise]\nThink what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and the debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat with Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but at the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefit we just have to check in with an Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thought\nName is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old I work at ... Indiana at at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this a film it\nBut after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her morale roughly sixteen\nAnd I have a son who does travel ball and for me this means more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kind of thing so for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck now and the way the two years for my stocks to vast\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer at us illness center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five an hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five\nAn hour oh it's concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting our pay out and making less\nMy news folks to Martinez had been working on for the last three weeks I worked in the ... for the Miami I started working in a store is a process and the gun from him about it you received a merchandise and Maine to bring the inventory\nOurs are making seven dollars for hours and know with the increase we're going to be making Fifteen dollars an hour after November first\n... was my early because it'll have to be looking for full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking hotel a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of there being fulltime bar time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this straight to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will all to start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of them believe that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing a raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holidays fees and you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal right\nSo there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said where really upset about the last ... about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that\nFor somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the companies that\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock option on a monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated the company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money would the Fifteen dollar minimum wage\nThan you were before so I took part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase to the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees to know that it was coming any idea why why why do they now so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcement kind of out of the blue to keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level what's happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been at state of stories are highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas there was that big\nEight thousand four hundred and forty dollars this is just above poverty level for a family of four\nNow that it's a worldwide number is what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company it is run by the world's wealthiest man so the contrast has been put in quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something\nHere before we wrap up here [noise] part of the Amazon announcement also mentioned that the company plans to lobby for a higher federal minimum wage and I'm asking you to speculate but do you think this was going to have an impact beyond Amazon itself\nI think that was one of the most important part of their announcement it was very rare for a corporation especially for Amazon to take kind of a very political stand and in this particular case I mean we're talking about federal minimum wage right now it's seven dollars and twenty five than it is an extremely low\n\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines President Trump is campaigning in Kansas for Republican candidates

verdict in a trial of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke\nMore than a year later dashcam video sparked large protest when it showed the officer shooting McDonald's sixteen times Van Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBUR be easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune I've been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life who are connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to\nFor it if you're guilty of murder [noise] we signed up for the fire [noise] first WB\nEasiest Gen Y is host of the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you\nSo let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming release um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trial the specially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder but there's also the sense that this is just one case\nAnd all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense that this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are there people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who's that that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was eventually responding to the training he'd been given so that the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their job well\nWhat you cover some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist but defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging\nTo his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy be not responding to command the jury took that to heart and and to them is that when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you mentioned in the pockets of reporting on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these rest or does it just keeps them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abuse of\nPolicing practice or after the video with relief to the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case that we think some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a ...\nTend to agree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different handled for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's gonna happen from here [laughter]\n... she's the hostess sixteen shots at the podcast from WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following the trial of officer Jason Van Dyke

were calling with some unexpected things to say I mean you hear that one caller saying I'm disappointed that it's all about party you hear the other caller saying\nI usually vote democratic this has turned me off and\nI think that's pretty representative\nOf the calls that I've been getting over the last couple of weeks about this people are really turned off\nThey were just aren't aren't by by
