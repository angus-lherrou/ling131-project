Rocco Syria [noise]\nA couple of years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life and rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by Matt\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they'd been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was for someone should fall ... [laughter]\nHer ... and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossil a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word that kind of look like ... in bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life\nShe says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt had ... and it's all going from the opposite\nSame the online retail giant used ... messaging system to peel it sellers in a lawsuit ... said Amazon representatives signed up for ... account and methods sellers to get them to sell their goods on Amazon dot com which ... said violated its user agreement\nOn the bank of England is full cost this could be actually a very chaotic and damaging appetite for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nThe is the fresh food road could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit call me we'll take a very big has\nTo take your saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicine and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines once you introduce border checks the place where there are no border checks for the moment you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile keys things just wouldn't be coming through so\nSo there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant from the poor so [noise]\nHave of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate says what would happen in the medium to that Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red type out the board has not without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as ... as sort of an aircraft crunchy losing hide you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves without a deal well for the rest\nOf your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such that scenario to play out because the person as a major destination for European expos so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's um and they won produces in France cop pertussis in Germany\nUm you name it they ... they will be effective because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for us\nDo the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from a deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more a lot that to be honest I I mean we all quite to the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides of not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does a deal in Brussels said she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal in fight the British Government could actually be the positive then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my patients options still despite all the negative noises around is that common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor

like really really interesting study at the latest study apology and\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover can we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of late night for the most extreme ... most late ride there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and it's ... with the different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increased revenues by one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue I went to two percent which we tested apologies and involved with a commitment to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... you better cars than maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and that as a result the those people punished\nI think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt interesting that we ... back to run more from a company like eat like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we don't want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains that it works on script interested and so you know we're entering a relationship with the company was sort of like the same sort of scripted risks triggering her brain and so because we stepped remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apology that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\n\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um that we touch with apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages in mind it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may not find a bit with the message that sort of committed to be more in the future\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or you're the you're better than flowers\nAnd flowers and candy because I always take on a whole new significant um does it has it changed the way like you apologize [laughter] people thought always wanted to ask you this question they do I'm curious I think the main way changes\nI because all my friends and my family know that I study apologies than they would always ... I might be skeptical whenever I Apologize so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest remorseful because people are always like oh you're just doing that because of your

in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen\nTo that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of candidates in Canada the BP spill has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges of talk crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the u._s.\nThe individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied them entry based upon that\nJust to parse this that there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grants from orange somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister true though he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on that we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because of federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it kind of a hypocritical situation by the
