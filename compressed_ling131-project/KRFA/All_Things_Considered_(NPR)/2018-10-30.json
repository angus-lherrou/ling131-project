to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump and Russia\nThe latest is a darn sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of that Hey Ryan either our first what has the special counsel's office that exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller\nCar does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's office was you know is usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this uh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nBut do we know anything about the purported clocks yes but the bears\nListen media outlets including NPR this individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down in individual with an empty provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking at the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller ...\n... best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty sixteen or a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually we're attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he'll edges is the first of Miller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller the bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor and moral is this\nThe special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against Muller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you

they dared\nOn ... on critical temperament to be you know you're going to be now you're just fear the worst ... you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing fear will provoke the ground but also trying to get out before someone throws the first row because you know once that happens for everyone to start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive off in time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like three or four times a week [noise] partly because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people\n... of the government even to this part of the ... the has a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor many believe the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth for themselves\nWe haven't seen anything from the government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not as a central government nor the United nations' peacekeeping force that is how strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so that's put on when an authority figure be it from the government or a foreign health worker showed up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether the outbreak even ... you know whether they're true motives but the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which Ebola responders are forced to hunker down and includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone he was had contact with an infected person with a

spreading to other parts of the country have workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC to Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBut the longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission
