Trump insisted he can change that\nCan definitely do it with an act of Congress but now there's\nFirst just backtrack forest can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because\nRight now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states ...\nThat seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century\nAnd the children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship they argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying well Republican\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say that Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what\nThey got a president in office who apparently as excited on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House has critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at a campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat it in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration and that that issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this that I

senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and help to eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nWe recently\nThese living room meetings were happening that night across the country\nHow do we do this to go around and hit\nThe women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos ... rating about politics\nThey actually do not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and put the hat that followed the presidential election I think that\nThe trust was gone by the women's march Iraq have\nAdded from this is Michelle nearly she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty eight team it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nThink our vote has been taken for granted um I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones\nAll along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly is underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be as far away from family we show what is\nWhat is the wife of why\nWe only\nAnd that list of issues important for black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice

there's nothing I'm Jewish\nAssure Williams added racial profiling\nSafe on in life whole he fit the profile\nAnd I'm like my dad is the suit my brother's these three there are all star game we use every man in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything or be a Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like ... all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara laid right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nInteresting because they don't given excused because they don't even think about it I think that's part of the problem they take for granted and over the years it's been\nYou of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we've seen brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republican but when you look at the policies the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't\nPersonally it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all that's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the

either I first what has that special counsel's office that exactly well\nA spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who said she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller\nCar does not specify the nature of those claims a special special counsel's offices you know it's usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this uh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plot\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of of that earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalist and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails that she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to\nOr as reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking at the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting gaining here\nThe timing is indeed curious and the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is undercutting the terrorist impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course like the both about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means to the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I made the leaders of countries the first thing that they invariably is this the presidents do nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut this is a ... also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the pain so just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you\nIt's at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on falls is because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd ... says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are as David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then make them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe Congress I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't even hardly counteracted\nHas so far imposed tariffs list\nImpact Lim says the following you on male have another impact foreign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheap off all U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below project\nTrump has promised to raise the terror of even more after the new year there that the rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China is falling currency is helping it absorb that blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nAnd government is highlighting something known as the social

consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nOne ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business she would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapse\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had
