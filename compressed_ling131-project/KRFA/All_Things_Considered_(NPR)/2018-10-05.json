Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges pass to have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants to Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath I\nAsked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by from the ... and then told me what exactly to do\nWhy does had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allow\nYou filled out this farm did you ever than sit down with are having a phone interview with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I waited by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or get proof allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was went looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think one should lie in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or what has taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony that's in regard to the extent to pitch drinking\nYes it is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think ... confused that was passing out but the black neon phrase means doing thing\nCan you say that he does for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nThey let me ask you that a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about making eighty three eighty four eighty five at your college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense at all\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an

[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nMost expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace but there are just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this like artist hey are what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something\nElse so you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a higher rate that's actually a good time economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nA lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case and the government started tracking these records back\nFrom where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings than others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at the health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels\nAnd then there's this category called professional in business services that are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going\nFaster than they are you know this has been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nIt could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a it makes them better at their jobs\nAnd it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's Cardiff Garcia co host of our economic podcast the indicator from Planet Money they fought pleasure Ari thanks\n[noise]\nSupport for a Planet Money comes from transfer wise a service
