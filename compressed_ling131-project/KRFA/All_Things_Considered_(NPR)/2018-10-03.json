assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I have never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reason they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him that would make him cry that someone did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it to the job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well [noise]\nDid get responses from people concerned about telling their mother but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents and different category is a lot of when and said I told my mother and learned that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world as a young woman\nAnd so they they were really afraid that their fathers in protest\nBut a lot of ... because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that [noise]\nYou know just just think about trope in sitcoms where\nThe dad is sent to buy a pack of co tax for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that she can never make\nWe do that with ... ... we do that with breast feeding all of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I

about some of the responses that you've had to this call him for that was published this week\n[laughter] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response please\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife of forty years and ... had this ever happened to her and she told me\nDo you think you're ready I didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi\nWell so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dad [noise] they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who stay I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send\nBecause what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time and good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about this took up they have a better understanding of what women go through\nThink so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dad for the first time because of ...\nBecause if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you're a father and you have a function of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew
