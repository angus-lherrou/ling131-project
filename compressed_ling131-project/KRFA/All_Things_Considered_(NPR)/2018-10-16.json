United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica ... found that women are punished disproportionately from minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states it all but two women get this one of the higher rates than men which most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons\nOf smaller infractions\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors you get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just picture room up nice and it takes and ... get written up for that that's the story of Williams and it made up the central California women facility\nIn show show a California you get ...\nOur number showed that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying in order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect in Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments\nIn Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets for disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women lose good conduct credits they can have time added to their stay in prison or lose phoning visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience\n[noise]

of corrections now she works with prisons as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get discipline more\nWomen are more can you ... when you walk through a prison\nAbout women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were just when almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor influence\nAnd they also really if they see an injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\nIs total she likes it that women prisoners are this way but\nShe said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nThe first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nOfficers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women pushback mass where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in\nTo

lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who to be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitment as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights\nAffairs and the actions of dictators overseas\nI think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent relationship with Washington a

a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we kill people to that that's going to lead someone like president to ... to think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president's condemned the actions of foreign leaders whether that was ... in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this is happening more because President Trump is an office\nDemocracy it translates into behavior abroad\nThe first of course is if dictators feel like they have a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare but the United states doesn't always criticized directly or one on one sometimes it works together with other western governments\nAnd they all do a day marched together or the issues simultaneous statements so that no one government gets the backlash all by itself\nAnd when the Trump Administration takes the United states out of that coalition it deters other western governments from speaking up as well\nOh so you're saying it's not just that the U.S is giving an implicit green light to these dictators but it's

entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women\nBut once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel doors for the women and that's not a family here because this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire displays looks kind of like a college campus\nWith red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don in ... depending on what level there and that's the word and he showed dom showing us around and do what we do that and the community of right now it's hard for our outside in our yard\nWomen's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get disappointed that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rolls they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insulin disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR ... school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions can have big consequences\nWomen get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the

he quit his psychiatry practice to work at the prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I Would\nAnd that has been chained for months at a time in the basement\nSold his property\nVictims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the warden\nLately the correctional officer and really at the Human Services worker at a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape or fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates
