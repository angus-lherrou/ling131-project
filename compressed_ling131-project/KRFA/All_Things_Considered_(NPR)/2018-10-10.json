what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that faded Fifteen people as a lot to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding is that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you not clear whether they wanted to capture\nAnd prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way okay\nLet's let's unravel that a little bit this to U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications
