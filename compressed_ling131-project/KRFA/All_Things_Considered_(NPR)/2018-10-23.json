forties\nMid term elections and he's keeping the fact checkers busy\nWe're going to take a look now at some of the president's latest claims with NPR's Scott Horsley hey there Scott ... first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants the president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way to Mexico and hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family it's looking for a better life what is he saying that\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners\nIllegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear and his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\nThis'll be the\n\nCommon sense [noise]\nThird on that Leslie was that tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republican thought would be the first thing that that\nTax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we hadn't been hearing too much about what's going on\nThe GOP tax cut his not warn terribly well right now is pulling at about forty percent approval uh a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank\nThe president believes he has a fix for this though and it's another tax cut I Want to play a piece of tape from his rally in Houston last night already but I have to warn you take this message with a big grain of salt where are you going to be ah\nWhatever you might think about the merits of another tax cut Congress certainly is not going to be take any action on that next week they're not even session until after the election\nAnd what's more nobody outside the White House seems to know what the president is talking about the head of the house ways and Means Committee belatedly put out a statement this afternoon saying he's willing to work with the president over the coming weeks\nBut this appears to be a bit of political vapor aware that it's just time for the election and a tacit admission to the actual tax cut the Republicans passed last year isn't selling very well\nSupport for NPR

turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of NYU Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bill being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states are messed around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we face states imposing strict photo identification laws uh meaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not ...\nChallenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of in reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nWhat we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn his role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted into into recycled or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as the administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late\nUm critically were also saying that purging is happening in states that used to be required under the voting rights act\nOr increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rolls [noise]\nUm even calling this voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturn now or it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much uh but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote surprised her very very resilient and very determined to overcome it\nBut having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way or that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place [noise]\n... is head of NYU\nThat can divide family more quickly than
