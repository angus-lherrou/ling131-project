Chang\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro it looks like North America will remain a free trade zone after all late last night Canada agreed to join the U.S and Mexico in an updated version of the north American free trade agreement it will no longer be called NAFTA but rather the U. S. M. C. A. NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPresident Trump has long railed against NAFTA calling at one of the worst trade deals ever negotiate it but in the White House Rose Garden this morning Trump's celebrated what was billed as a new and improved trade deal Trump called it a positive step for both the country and the world\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed\nIn signing on to the deal Canada agreed to open up bits long protected dairy market at least a little bit Trump says that means new opportunities for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk\nButter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific [noise]\nThe dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess were not certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market at what the us views as artificially low prices\nAnd exchange for these concessions to the U.S agreed not to scrap NAFTA Arab process for resolving trade disputes even though Trump wanted to preserving that arbitration process was a top priority for Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau\nWhen you're trading partners ten times your size you need rules you need a level playing field\nThe U.S and Mexico had reached a tentative trade deal more than a month ago but Canada didn't agree to sign on until late last night just hours before a White House deadline Walter do cautions there are still hoops to jump through before the deal is finalized the threat of a trade agreement that left Canada on the sidelines has been averted\nWhat I can say is that free and fair trade in North America is in a much more stable place than it was yesterday\nRallied on the news with the Dow Jones industrial average\nPena Nieto leaves off of it will then be up to the incoming U.S Congress to decide whether to approve the agreement\nThe president's trade representative Robert Lighthizer says he expects the deal to win back in from a lot of Democrats as well as Republicans Celeste Drake who oversees trade policy for the AFL CIO says well she still has a lot of questions about the fine print the administration has been attentive to the concerns of organized labor\nWhatever else is going on in other parts of the administration and after Lighthizer has and very serious about listening to our ideas and wanting that support a working family\nWhite House aides in the new deal is a vindication of the president's hard nosed negotiating tactics which included stiff tariffs on us allies and the threat of even harsher protectionist measures\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the library of Congress with the national library service for the blind and physically handicapped a program that offers thousands of books for all ages in audio and braille format more at one eight hundred three hundred six thousand [noise]\nAnd from T Rowe price offering a strategic investing approach that examines investment opportunity firsthand institutions advisors employers and indeed\nThere have been a lot of books written about chaos and dysfunction in the Trump White house the latest book by Michael Lewis looks lower down the food chain at parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books were not open to the point where when I roll in a few months later\nI'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nYou give us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about [noise] so the department of energy could just as easily be called the department\nOf nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department of energy [noise]\nSo there's jock there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who was in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people staying in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leave\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... we don't how we manage this\nPersonally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside the apartment but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey ... from it especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path of dangerous weather\nAn incentive to screw it up at one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits fracking whether\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term cost of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in this administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] are these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs [noise]\nKnow we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service\nPort and so the jobs and on top of that Trump's still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government so there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named ... Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that now [noise]\nWell first let's explain why Mitt family wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this act of destruction would come and kind of ease or pain she wouldn't have to stare at the barn any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her born is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works ... imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the ...\nWe're we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis his new book is the fifth risk thanks for

getting started in western Wyoming Grand Teton national park and it will continue to mid November park officials urge people today to heat brightly colored warning signs and stay away from areas where the routine trappings is occurring\nBiologist to date the grizzly bears and put them with tracking colors also collect samples and take measurements\nAt the White House today the president held a sun dabbled press conference to talk about his new trade deals but inevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions\nAmong them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president a sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question well you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit\nBackground investigation was reopened but what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court now he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan\nWho sits ideologically at the center of the court and today the liberal conservative split was a parent in the first case to be argued\nA challenge to a regulation under the endangered species act the central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this\n[noise]\nThis she's lived in only one place in Mississippi\nAnd have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the ... case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that\nAt some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds warehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plant\nAfter the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know you'd go systems are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language in the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one\nAnd the courts for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is a four to four tie would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or lose\n[noise] Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nA drug commonly used to treat the bone thinning disease on parole could protect many more older women against bone fractures that's according to a big new study published today by the New England Journal of medicine and NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the details\nAs we age our bones tend to get dinner and dinner and dined read at the University of Auckland says millions of older people break a hip spine or some other bone and it's often the beginning of the end\nIn a file older person having a fracture can be the final straw interferes with the independent they moved to an institution\nAnd the problems just getting\nWhat's happening at the present time as we are living longer population is aging and so [noise]\nAbout people with less frail bones\nOf fact most of the factors that occur in older people and the much larger number of people who have ... loss\nSo Reed and his colleagues tested a drug long used to treat osteoporosis on two thousand women sixty five an older with just the early stages of bone loss a condition known as ... for six years half caught infusions of the drug half got a placebo\nWho use or about a one food production into door numbers of fractures about fifty percent reduction in spine fractures\nAnd no sign of any serious side effects in fact the women getting the drug were less likely to suffer a heart attacks get cancer maybe even die\nSo I think what this means is that we can broaden the group of people to whom we can offer these medications and therefore we can reduce the number of fractures occur across the community more effectively\nOther experts agree this is an extremely important paper that's Apple's Cyrus at Columbia the reason this is so important is that we have been uncertain what to do\nWith the great number of people primarily women over the age of sixty sixty five who have on the opinion you know you have a drug that you can use that has been shown to work\nDrop problems but Michael ... of the American society for bone in mineral research says the new results should make people rethink that\nWe are overly worried about exceedingly rare side effects and under worried about common things like fractures I think you have to start looking at where the big picture is but others are more cautious\nThis one study is helpful and it just by one study of itself does not necessarily the truth\nThat's Robert ... from Yale he's president elect of the American College of physicians\nWe're not going to reconvene and immediately changed the guidelines\nBut everyone agrees that older people should talk with their doctors about
