warmed by two degrees Celsius\nBut this report find the consequences could actually come sooner when the earthworms by one and a half degrees Celsius which is on track to happen in just about Twenty years\nThe un included data from over six thousand scientific studies\nAnd one of those studies came from the nonprofit think tank climate interactive where Andrew Jones is the cofounder welcome thank you thank you also don't make that clear to report it predicting really the same consequences of climate change that previous reports had been predicting but this report that the consequences will happen sooner\nYeah that's the basic idea and when I read it for the first time I was struck with the urgency and they really laid out with such precision the hearing now element of this problem and not do it for the grandkids\nSo many of these effects that you just mentioned around twenty forty it also affects you and I plan to be here around twenty I order in lido yeah so what this is a kind of hearing now impacts the scientists were writing about the what would it take to\nLately exist you hear some of those studies ... ... it makes you think\nGosh I just want to hide under the covers and\nWatch them Netflix can hear you but if you think about it facing this kind of impossibility is really something to that what humans were made for and the report lays out really well if we're willing to take on the kind of efforts that we've had in the past and\nHumans have done it also and in World War two\nFlying to the moon yeah rebuilding Europe after the plague took out of I don't\nLast that was going to point out you wrote an op ed in the New York times the other day when you compare that seemingly insurmountable task of confronting climate change to to think like winning World War two or achieving civil rights but was that supposed to be reassuring because you do make a challenge seem awfully daunting\n[laughter] well it is daunting and we get to kind of remember our humanity and what we have pulled off in the past these amazing things where humans have faced impossibility and the scientific report laid out really well what we get to do\nAnd it's no silver bullet it is this mix of\nClean energy and wind and solar and pricing carbon and energy efficiency men walkable by couple communities plant based\nSo this is the big challenging and World War two task in front of us I think we're up to it and the report says if we did it all we could technically\nReached that goal of living in warm into one point five degrees but but but that raises the question of a political will as you said is that this requires buck shot in all different directions but President Trump has withdrawn to us from the Paris accord the front runner in Brazil's election

had formed to launch the so called supervised injection sites as Bobby Allyn of member\nIn Philadelphia have been studying the idea of a supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals\nThe creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most significant step so far and making that a reality one of the most prominent board members of the group as former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell twelve hundred\nAnd Seventy Philadelphians died of overdoses most of them die alone in the year twenty Seventy the highest rate per capita of any big city in America we've got to do something to stop in\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York to Seattle and San Francisco are considering opening a supervised injection sites they haven't done yet California Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use\nIts position shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection site in Philadelphia\nIt remains illegal under federal law and people engage in that activity remains vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement\nMessage or Mr Rosenstein um incorporate or of the safe injection site nonprofit and they can come and arrest me first ... says his race\n[noise] but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely round the gold find with the aid Law Project a Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with a nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting the site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem the nonprofit is

tech considered\n[noise] this month we're looking at our bodies the way technology these them here in the U.S we're gradually getting you to facial\nRecognition technology that in our phone in some airport security but then on social media\nBut how good and and how the queue or is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she they facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm being facial recognition pop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but an airport\nWhite or use of this stuff where [laughter]\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and\nThe viewpoint is frontal this new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images\nSo that crazy facial expression or that you know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the house\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that missed identified people of color much more frequently than it missed identified white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistake like that happen\nYeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nNot be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there are just a lot more photos of white people in the database to these people the software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I get less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race biased that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software Doug work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implication when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understand where that science is\nHow do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that's certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs\nStations about what the right ways to use the technology are Alice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you
