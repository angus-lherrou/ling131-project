however\nUh that the package didn't contain any sort of suspicious explosives another was California congresswoman Maxine Waters US Capitol police say that they intercepted a suspicious package that was addressed to her\nThey say it was removed and is being investigated by the FBI\nRight now we don't know whether the FBI didn't mention her because her package a doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just must receive too late in the clear at this point but the FBI did say in a statement on Wednesday that it's possible that there are more suspicious packages out there or that it

the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west dates are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rate NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town\nIn a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert Mesa and red rock lifts you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here that says how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding now and I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley\nThat's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboys stereotype of self reliance that runs deep you know pick up a buyer bootstraps mentality Kathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids I think that we\nResources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes ... says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says that for the kids were told not to talk about the suicide or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts news sources of drank suicide prevention program\nHow she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologist but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the two sides\nAlongside the men towards the school district also hired as suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year\nWhat are the warning signs and

strength\nTalking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt costs to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the school people on the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa jewel she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband is suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSchools husband grew up here was captain of his high school football team valedictorian of pilots\nBoundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\n... says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there's so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or ... dad an uncle and mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at the demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the school Genevieve Morris says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on use 'em well you'd have a\nSuper powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to

running on her record she's running away from her record on health care and putting her party's needs above our\nCongress is broken right now she's the leader of a Congress that has blown a huge hole in the budget not dealt with health care or immigration and even left town without a farm bill ...\nAnd defend our healthcare\nUm work for solutions not just talking points eastern Washington deserves an advocate that has more ah for\nAh getting things done than simply standing up for party priorities it would be an honor for me to serve you in Congress and I'm asking for your vote this evening [noise]\nThank you [noise] we began our debate tonight with the economy the u._s. it's currently experiencing robots economic growth\nLocally unemployment that uh twenty eight year low and consumer spending is picking up\nHowever the federal deficit is also growing by Seventeen percent this past year and trade agreements with our long term trading partners are undergoing significant changes the first question to you Lisa\nWhat did you see as the direction of the economic growth and what actions had the current Congress taken the you consider to be beneficial or harmful to the ... economic growth you have sixty seconds thanks I'm Glad we're starting with\nThe economy we really have more than one economy in eastern\nKind of me here in southeast Washington unfortunately this Congress has acted irresponsibly as I mentioned doubling the national debt in two years\nI'm a get a longer term visa\nThank you kept your question regarding immigration last year President Trump's administration ended the DACA program and then than Congress has not resolved the ongoing crisis in which hundreds of thousands of young people including many young people young people in our valley find themselves\nFirst first part of the question is do you support DACA and secondly what do you say to people who ask you what is going to happen to my family and friends\nI have met with many dark individuals' over the last year and and beyond that\nWe needed to give DACA individuals' certainty and I have been negotiated legislation voted on legislation to give them give DACA the certainty because many came here no fault of their own\nVacation refugees um and and our uh and we need a merit based a visa and that's the solution that I have\nHelped draft and supported in Congress\nSo that if someone was in school if they were working or if they were had joined the military that they would be able to get a visa and then over a period of time get a permanent status get in line to be\nTo get citizenship if they would like to do that that's the part of the solution that I've promoted and I am committed to working in a pilot and buy parts in a way to get immigration reform done\nHere that um when [laughter] I guess my question because uh [noise] because over\nA year ago you said that the doctor\nA student's deserved a path forward and you're in leadership and your party is in control of both houses of Congress and the presidency so there is no reason to be talking about what you support or what you negotiated bring the bill forward and it will pass\nThank him next question is regarding women rights the me too movement\nThe new man has also been that with the backlash with it being criticized as having gone too far I think that what do you think is the proper place for the me too movement are we making progress with regard to changing the culture surrounding sexual harassment\nOr are we actually regretting as a result of the movement gone too far well we're not\nSaying we have made progress but there's so much more to make when I first moved to Spokane I joined with others and we took on the first women take back the night march to bring up the reality of domestic violence which was not necessarily talked about with hidden and swept under the rug\nOr I serve on the board of the of the YWCA in Spokane and it is sad to understand how many relationships are are stubborn because of domestic violence and how much family violence there is\nAnd we need to talk about it we need more than having a victim of domestic violence have their stories be told they also deserves justice and due process\nAnd a independent investigations and we need to hold the perpetrators accountable\nI Believe that those that have been involved in domestic violence sexual assault sexual abuse they need to know that they have a place that they can go and that they can ... and that it is a safe place and that is\nWhen when the me too movement was was sweeping the country we had our own situations on Capitol Hill and I led we got some rules change we got legislation passed to give staff\nOn Capitol Hill a place where they could go ... or an office that would give them that that safe place I think it's very important that women know that they this is not acceptable and they have a place they can go\nThank you Cathy your question regarding women's rights [noise] what do you want the future to look like for women's rights and what are you doing to advance that vision\nOr I Want you know I grew up on a farm [laughter] I I never imagined I Would one day be serving in Congress I was the two hundred woman ever elected to serve in the United States House of representatives out of\nA nearly eleven thousand who have had the honor of serving I Want every woman to have the confidence that she can be anything that she wants to be my\nAmerica that you can do that this is this is the country that has led the world in raising a\nAn opportunity when I was growing up I never thought about if I was male or female or what opportunities I had because of that I Believe that I could do anything that I wanted to be and that's what I Want for every woman and every man child in in America and this is the country the unique country in the world\nThat that is possible that the ... there's a big contrast here we are women deserve to have more than confidence we need to be in control of our own reproductive health care choices which is something my opponent opposes [noise]\nShe has also voted to weaken the violence against women act and against the equal pay act for women so we want more women leaders in Congress and it's great that two women leaders running here tonight but we need women leaders who stand up for women's rights\n[noise]\nI

D. also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages\nAre found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland is is really sprawling and a lot worse\nI really look at the details here and trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN's New York office or the eyes Williams Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these\nYou know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're they're focusing an investigation or asking for tips from the public are there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is where these packages sent through the whole system or some of them could they have been delivered by courier\nAnd also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who was the individual or individuals behind this\n... that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nIn the meantime what more is known about the packages that were found today in Delaware and New York will\nThe baggage is in New York as we mentioned earlier was were sent to vice president former vice president Joe Biden and Newcastle county Delaware and there was one baggage that was sent to the business office of Robert De Niro here in Manhattan\nAnd what's really interesting is actually found by a retired cop was working for um Mr De Niro production company and he spotted after noticing very similar resemblance to photos of packages found earlier this week and he called in a call that tip into the bomb squad New York city police orange bumps glad they came in and removed

NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish Megan Kelly and her NBC morning talk show may soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nTo show I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David have you already so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our ... she was having a chat a couple of days ago with a several panels about Halloween costumes and talks about how she is not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\nIt's really you get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on all the way in or a black person and puts on weight like a kid that was okay as long as you're addressing\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all that's\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story or both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show and the hours proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe always a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin uh depressed the newest co hosts the today show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run a month I'm that way and it's nice and juniors and it's just as ignorant and races there's been statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well this isn't the first time making Kelly of tastes criticism while at NBC um why do people think that for the last straw\nSharper edge Fox News host she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show is been ailing a it's a guide rather tepid I'm a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embrace that time me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who were teens is tied to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet\nYou know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a cool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC\nAs she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall and I ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for ah ah for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological\nMegan Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round here would um we do every year old who was in fact we joke\nThat October is black ... I've been an advocate Halloween is Christmas at all culminated in this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out and maybe the annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well walk us\nThrough some of the history of this when did we first started saying blackface and America\nWe first start saying black these in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like by people I talked to in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missiles foods depicted black people are lazy at animal is to play caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twentieth century\n\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the portrayals of Native Americans and yellow fever portrayal of Asian American pie ready to think of Mickey Rooney character in breakfast at Tiffany's\nUm but it does mocking depictions of people of color\nThat these Halloween controversy fit against that and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured or the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles\nCoordinate wearing black because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... to ... this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about the history [noise] what do you make of that\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often ignored without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and the panel is all white and I went to the port and she seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about so that was brought a concert\nWe're just not going to argue about it so I'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when he's controversy tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party me about an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or patriot from that party slipped out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and then that video had to contend with\nA different context with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery and so maybe they know conversation\nWill be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on in people's fold and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team ... thank you so much my Louisiana over [laughter]\nI Hope not [noise]\nFor twenty\nNine President Trump is threatening to cut us ...\nThat reasoning or that support that's been there to make life better for Delaware

with her wandered out of the woods according to authorities\nThe border collie named aged belonging to Connie Johnson beard Wednesday at a camp near moose creek ranger station where private churches were gathered delusion tribunal said the search for Johnson he started October fifth and was ended by law enforcement officials on October sixteen but no slanted the pair until the dog showed up\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cut foreign aid\nPrograms and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now wants to some of the programs you're just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here you know each country in the end should be responsible\nFor their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problem of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day that we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere\nNearby and with a lot of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home for places that do affect a day\nWhich is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S some gang members were deported back to Central America\nUnited States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states with a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of the group\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now ... national in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prison than in our communities into those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nation\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly two windows on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nYou know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would I Would ask him to hold these government accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it\nThe council on Foreign

Hamilton has more\nDoesn't get much respect scientist often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass the roadside sobriety test it helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the therapy\nConnections about twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion

less\nAmerica Says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor their brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but doesn't Bock says the findings published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results were way more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDoesn't ... says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists a neurologist had been missing in front of the time\nAnd doesn't says the new study offers a good reason\nKings ... editing of your thoughts one scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results his Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia\nRahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of Sarah but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that are involved and cognition means at cerebellum is involved in those process to use as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it's moving out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhile we now understand is that what about um does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\n... says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of
