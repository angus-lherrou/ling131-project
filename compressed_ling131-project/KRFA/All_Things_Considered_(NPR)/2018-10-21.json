N. F. or the intermediate range nuclear forces agreement\nThen President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the treaty in Nineteen eighty seven it banned all short and medium range nuclear and non nuclear missile NPR Shannon ... that has the latest the\nUs says Russia violate the treaty to developing a medium range missiles that is able to have NATO member countries at short notice defense secretary James Mattis has described\nRussia's breach of the agreement as untenable Kingston reef the director for disarmament research at the arms control association and advocacy group says the Trump administration's withdraw from the treaty will allow Russia to continue the deployment of that type of mental and revive Cold War tensions\nAll constraints on the production of feeling of that missile have gone away thereby increasing the threat to our allies particularly in Europe in range of those missiles\nMilitary competition with China was another reason for the U.S withdraw China was never a signatory to them\nChecked at the federation of American scientists which promotes international transparency and nuclear disarmament\nChina has undertaken a rod modernization of its military forces and as part of the modernization has increased its own inventory of weapons to fall into the on air French\nReached at the end of the INS may portend us withdraw from another agreement the new strategic arms reduction treaty or new start which limits nuclear warheads deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles for each country\nThe apparent breakdown of the agreement and the uncertain future of another bilateral U.S Russia arms control treaty the twenty ten new strategic arms reduction treaty or new start creates the most serious nuclear arms control crisis we've seen in some time\nChristians and said withdraw from both treaties with paramilitary competition globally\nYou'd be the first time essentially since the Nineteen seventies that would be no nuclear arms control agreements regulating the the nuclear powers of the world and so the door would be wide open for potentially a new arms race between these countries\nThe last time the U.S withdrew from a major arms treaty was in two thousand two when President George W. Bush pulled the U.S out of the anti ballistic missile\nThe U.S department of justice that it is investigating Catholic Church dioceses across the state\nThe federal investigation come two months after the Pennsylvania attorney general's office released a grand jury report accusing church leaders of covering up the abuse of more than a thousand people from within Seventy years we're headed to Pennsylvania next weekend to report from there so we thought we'd call Maria Pena write us for a preview\nShe's a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer and she's been writing about the clergy sexual abuse scandal and other issues for years and she's with us now welcome thank you so much for joining us\nSupport for NPR come from the station and from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men starring John flattery Amanda Pete Paul rider and Kathryn ... on a new episode every Friday on prime video\nFrom Subaru featuring the all new three row is spent with feeding for up to eight and a choice of second row captain's chairs love it's what makes us Subaru was Subaru learn more it Subaru dot com and from the listeners who support this NPR station\n\nThis is all things considered from ...\nWe're finally starting to hear from women and men who've experienced that far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it Don ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd dumb Pomeranian is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr ... thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after ... Ford testify about what she says but now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot\nYou know so I was saying well I'm going to just write something that but my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I sit in the article I committed a crime and I did\nYou know what you wrote it's hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people have this\nAnd you were at a party right yeah\nLet me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties\nNever and so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody all of a sudden a kid came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window to about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a\nA girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off many he he took her panties off\nAnd then he he pulled on his than\nAny one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders and he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other boys are the party started touching another young woman who was also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left yet this\nWhat one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would've been told it's your\nFault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilty you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what our role has been in creating a culture that tolerates that we've all seen things we've all heard other men\nTalk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long I I\nThe murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault and uh I I Can't say I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent\nOn this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it [noise]\nHow did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] [noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that until this article came out ... let me just [laughter] it's a it was tough for her to take let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did you explain that to your boy well\nJust I was truthful with them and uh they were very receptive on their dad you know dad's can you know we we kinda can't do too much wrong in the in the eyes of our kids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now and he said everybody at that window\nSince that kid wouldn't have done it because you wouldn't have wanted to be on film you say well we film everything you know what they would kind of alluding to\nWell how do you feel now but you got it off your chest\nYou know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there there are days when I regret it and then there are days that\nI'm Glad I did you know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people\nThere's some women have said it's about time someone ... it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this\nA lot of women are said uh they were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a assaulted who wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say the only thing I can say is I'm\nTo help these women then but I didn't do it Don ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives so it may be hard to remember just how shocking it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine when Carolina Panthers wide receiver rake Ruth was charged with orchestrating the murder of his pregnant girlfriend shriek Adam\nAdam [laughter] I don't want to [noise]\nTo Ruth was acquitted of first degree murder and that supported the death penalty but he was convicted of planning the murder carried out by a hit man she was able to deliver the child named chancellor but she died weeks later\nCould Ruth was sentenced to more than two dozen years in prison but with time served scheduled to be released tomorrow from tempting correctional institution and Clinton North Carolina Scott Fowler has been covering the story for nearly two decades where the Charlotte Observer and he's just released a seven part report in a pod cast about Ruth the murder and the aftermath it's called careers\nAnd got power is with us now from Charlotte Scott thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you so much for having me on the show really appreciate it and it's my understanding that you you never talked with him after the the murder but he ...\nA drug deal gone wrong in essence he says that he was a cow or not to kill her that he thought that van Brett whack and just trying to kill him and he left the scene but that he didn't do anything about it is that about right\nYes van Brett Watkins was the hit man that truth hired to commit the murder or you know drive by shooting sort of situation\nAnd truth yes I have spoken to him on the phone for about twenty minutes but off the record so it helped inform my reporting some but\nIt was ultimately his attorney who who I'm most recently spoke to for the the pod cast that's exactly what he says it was violent retribution van ... what can be an angry accrued for this drug deal that group had agreed to finance\n[noise]\nI'm Louise give only with these headlines Saudi Arabia has confirmed the death of Washington Post columnist Jamal could show gee blaming it on a fist fight President Trump says the Saudis have taken a good first step but he believes there's more to it [noise]\nMeanwhile German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she backs a freeze on arms exports to Saudi Arabia following the killing of the writer Merkel told reporters in Berlin that Germany
