Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises the question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is legal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd ... held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all and to the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same that border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to ... he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use\n... welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of candidates in Canada the BP spill huh\nLegally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges and talk crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my office is the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the mentored based upon that\nSo just to parse this shot there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questioned potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the path that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now here the diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in ...\nThat's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the CBP huge point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to have some common sense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nTo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\nHe's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state the rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour when a week

the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls\nQuite a few gates is the former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle in many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nFlorida families any of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes on the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less\nFar below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael in the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage\nA consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter David provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been

considering when it starts as students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it\nRaised to sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but often times the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard saying that they don't do that but what's been for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents learn missions as a group that brought this last year we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although there is going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in the case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost at the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nThe guys with diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting

conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite the barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\n[noise] so I think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at married in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nSounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application ...\nSort
