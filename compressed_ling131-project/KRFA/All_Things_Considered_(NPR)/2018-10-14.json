Florida where relief efforts are underway in the area hit by hurricane Michael\nAccess to food water and other supplies it's still a challenge NPR's Joel Rose has been there reporting for the last couple of days Joel what have you seen\nI've seen long lines for gas for food for water um for all sorts of basic supplies are as people are are trying to come back into their homes and and clean up after the storm\nBut you know long lines is an improvement because earlier in the week you couldn't find any of those things in Panama City or any of the surrounding suburbs\nUm so you know where we are seeing an emergency response really start to step up and get these things out to people but it's it you know it remains a challenge to find some to get supplies and to some of the harder hit areas\nI'm In the suburbs to the east to Panama City and also up into rural inland communities that were hit really hard by the storm um that are a little more difficult to reach so you know ... ...\nPhone service is down the Internet's down how that affected rescue effort\nI think it has been a real problem I mean cell phone service those non existent for days after the storm and it's still really spotty I'm In Panama City in the surrounding county\nAnd it's difficult because people can't coordinate the emergency response it's hard to\nTell people where to go if you can't communicate with them and it's also making it really difficult for people to call their family members and check in and say hey I you know I'm OK I'm here you know I Need this or that kind of supply or even just I'm Alive you know I mean emergency crews are going door to door to try to\nYou know figure out who survive the storm and who didn't and and I have to think it would be a lot\nIt it must be slowing this effort down for them not to be able to communicate with people by cell phone or anywhere almost anywhere in Bay county so it's um [noise] I think it's been a real hindrance to the relief effort\nAnd some areas in the state do you have power back but there are a lot of places that still don't have power you have any idea when that's going to change\nWe got some new information today from the local utility Gulf Power they're saying that Ninety five percent of their customers in Florida will have power back by October twenty fourth if they are ready to receive it and\nBut that said that two weeks after the storm made landfall and that would be a huge accomplishment considering that you know devastation to the electrical infrastructure all over Panama City in the suburbs I mean there are electric pulled down everywhere\nAnd lines in the street you can't drive anywhere without driving over electric lines and uh you know so it's a giant maps and if they could have power back to much of the county and two weeks that you know that would be great\n[laughter] maybe it's too early to ask this question but I was wondering the people that you've spoken to you out there are they talking about rebuilding are they talking about coming back [noise]\nWell the people I've talked to her most of the people who who did write out the storm in their homes um and they do want to rebuild

I first what are the arguments being made in the case\nStudents for fair admissions the group that filed the lawsuit will be trying to prove essentially for things in this case first they say that Harvard illegally uses a quota system or racial balancing in admissions\nThey say the admissions rates for each demographic group or or two similar from year to year us ducking the group is arguing that Harvard admissions is considering race too much or that at the deciding factor and not just a factor of a factor like affirmative action policy actually allowed\nThe group also think that Harvard has an adequately explored admissions methods that don't use race they say that you really can still get a diverse class by ...\nDating against Asian Americans in this application process\nAnd there'll be trying to prove this with a lot of statistical analysis actually but it basically boils down to an argument where\nThey'll try to show that while Asian American applicants do have the highest academic qualifications or GPA standardized test scores things like that that they consistently or in the lower personal scores from the admissions department\nAnd a a personal score is a number of the Harvard assigns applicants to to write things like personal essay letters of recommendation and even the amount of personal hardship that someone face but the\nPerson behind this lawsuit is an Asian American raid his name is Edward Blum can you tell us more about him\nThat is true yes Edward Blum is the president of students for fair admissions and that is the group but technically brought this lawsuit\nUm and this isn't Edward Blum first court case attacking affirmative action policies in higher education he's also spearheaded the lawsuit behind Fisher versus the University of

students are at the forefront because that's a little stir illustrates the problem is\nWhat is Harvard have to say well Harvard is standing behind their admissions policies and they say they don't
