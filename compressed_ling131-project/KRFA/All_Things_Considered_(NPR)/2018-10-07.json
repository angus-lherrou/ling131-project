S. throughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different\nThis is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation\nYou know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for the United nations or another international organization\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of the family the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nIs one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president's say there's many countries were denying these is from the other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa\nDrew somehow figure out how to get married and I know their country and whether that is even something that's an option that James Wiley Brewster he wasn't asked her to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand seventeenth he's currently a principal at the consulting firm ... take me a global ambassador thank you so much for talking to us well it's such a pleasure to speak with you and I wish you to have the best days\nNow to our series on China's growing influence in the world that influence it felt particularly strongly in Latin America where Chinese investments are growing rapidly\nIt's often said that Brazil provides the food on China's dinner tables from soybeans to beef and chicken those experts helped make China Brazil's biggest trading partner as NPR's Philip Reeves reports Brazil also had something else the Chinese want\nYou see this as a young\nMan playing soccer hon I'm often in some look again and you'll notice to something different about this case we're in Brazil overplays Chinese teenagers who've come here eleven thousand miles from home to pursue a tree\nMade you mean if the if you go I Want to go the my country to him in China they work up to them by being ... by Yemen up anti\nI think I like the brothers both I Want the plane here because the step by step here for for me is good I Want to make a professional player so everything the bird to [noise]\nTo soccer training academy near a town called ... in southeast Brazil\nIt's part of a minor league Brazilian club called ...

News I'm Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct is in the news again\nWe should have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week Devon police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nThe violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killing a police officer is up slightly over the past year\nAnd policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor of police science at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us [noise]\nThank you for having me you know what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there has been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at is not so much the number switch\nStatistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that but then but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about for the something off ... says investors said this on the office of so from my perspective suddenly what did I Know fender winds of police officers were killed in the ...\nWhether it's some turned that we are seeing that is dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so it's just kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case if you look at the most recent years we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer in meditation\nAnd we're looking at an investigative activity um whether the handling and they'll persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations that and ... no longer than\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this\nI think that they're premeditated by what kind of of act doors as it as it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are\nAnd then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to press the police are biased or racist and and um with Senate things the last two years in general how the climate on in the last few years since the ...\nI'm a mental illness plus a triggering event then you have the the cut us off it got so if somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of violence Supreme Court\nYou'd think police officers is pushing back to demonstrate to us so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this published men to spot the the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because you cannot take your anger out to be on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative for the government was a police officer\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens and the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement um death and the ones that are at ... the ... the activities is definitely a threatening issue office so frequently a seat in the ...\nGiven that particular environment you've been said and political development that might be putting their lives in danger so this is a technical issue is how you approach and the problem and how you go to the house\nA well you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous but I mean we have eight thousand police agencies and when you have eight in South ... police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training which would certainly help us\nMitigate the negative perception of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers but needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine officers in one year aren't killed in that line of duty of an outcome most premeditated took to because it was directed against them explicitly another democratic society should accept a nine police officers in one year in separate the incidents killed by members of the ... can accept\nThat as Maria ... she is a professor in the department of law police science at criminal justice administration at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York professor ... thank you
