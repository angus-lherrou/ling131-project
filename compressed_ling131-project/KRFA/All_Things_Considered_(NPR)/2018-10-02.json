department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered\nAnd in each case the story is pretty much the same what happened well what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later\nI'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get and when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person\nThere was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up\nWell the real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise you give us an example of what happened\nOr weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department of energy [noise]\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who was in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people staying in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leave\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey ... trumpet especially didn't any idea what they did and B\nNine just interest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department of commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose campaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it\nThis is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nIf you want to do things like eliminate investments in alternative energy to generate short term\nWhether it really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long

Well hi Ari tell us more about Jason Kander a Democrat with deep appeal in a deep red state\nRight as he's a lawyer he was a form of Missouri's secretary state he did a tour in Afghanistan as an intelligence officer\nBack in two thousand six and then came home and got into Missouri politics he made a surprisingly good run in a deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt in two thousand uh sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from this ad hundreds and Kansas\nSenator blunt and he's in an empty warehouse blindfolded and he's assembling an A R Fifteen style rifle and the while he's doing he's talking about gun rights and he says he supports gun ... supports gun rights but he also support background checks\nHe says to keep terrorists from getting one of these and then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold\nLessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician the Democratic party\nAnd his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise and I came with a very honest and emotional letter message or tell us about it\nRight it was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nThat he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in a in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line to Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had\nBeen having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization he started to something called the let America vote which is a anti

workers in the U.S fulltime part time time and he's an old Amazon says that about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I asked Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility was just under lemon dollar range of over Fifteen dollars\nThat's already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cent but still Amazon they had been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American

including at retail and fast food restaurants\nHe has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidy the bill would tax large corporations whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAt our hope and believe that I'm On the computer will cause other companies like Wal Mart a fast food industry and start reading their wages as well so it's a good day for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty cops go

raises are good for the workers who get them tender local economies lower wage workers so they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste day it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage however Amazon Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to Bush for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number will even for a while but\nThen at our standards says he hopes the ... the stamp of approval convinces the rest of the country that Fifteen dollars an hour is
