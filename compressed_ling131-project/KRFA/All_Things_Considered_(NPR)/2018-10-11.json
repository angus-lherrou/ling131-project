requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bust you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely or we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says the limos should have their own standards because they're neither ... nor buses\nWhen she started a gym in between the two of them have come up with nothing\nAre regulated by a patchwork of state and local

place underneath the vehicle and on the interior the vehicle\nBut not every company does those test there are other risks safety experts say Leno's often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look\nQuite Rosemary Shanahan is the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the owners shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's just really grossly unfair people aren't they always care about safety I just think most people assume that if they're in the business that if their minimum requirements that they have to be\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limos safety\nAnd twenty Fifteen there was a deadly limo crash on Long Island

what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rage rage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous and in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the ash and the five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the

and inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair or a drone Paul has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so there's concern in the market that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation\nPressures so you're saying the economy remains strong that shouldn't that be good for the stock market\nEconomy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today sell off is not the end of the bowl marketing stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe has cooled a bit as have emerging markets and the IMF gave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S and China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market

the foundation\nWhich also has a lot of tax lost three and a ... percent\nSo it's been a very tough day for tech and very tough day but is it just the beginning of along down there trying for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so sometimes the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached level that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American business that it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point or investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough\nThat the interest rates they're paying is

there Greg [noise]\nHi Mary Louise how bad is it [noise] well\nIt's what you would expect to you know it was a category for storm nearly category if I were in ... came ashore right here the I passed right over this this area and Mexico beach which is a very small community you know the storm surge came in and you can see signs of every of every where there's still lots of standing water here most of the water went out but there's still plenty of it around\nBut it was those wins you know a hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds just tore our hearts many buildings here lifted up entire buildings through them down and other ones you saw roofs off you know siding off sides off um luckily the most people who had left and weren't here to Seattle\nAnd are you able to drive around them into the streets\nCame over from Tallahassee day it should be a couple of hours\nMy producer Becky Sullivan and I took us nine hours to get here because you just don't know what roads are open and when the roads are open they're just barely open you have to drive around this round down trees your power crews out ... and ... and good Samaritans doing what they can but it's still very hard slog get in or out of this area\nRight at what about the impact on people I mean as always with the storms some people said they rode out the storm I assume you've been out talking to them what are they saying [noise]\nYeah I mean it's it's a tough one I talked to him a man here who stayed and he said he left in hurricane oval which was in Nineteen Ninety\nFive and he always regretted that there is so hard to get back into the community later he always where he'd states we stayed and he said the storm is like anything he was prepared for it or at ever experienced before you know the the sound the noise the the windows the walls flexing\nAnd he had a little safer and built for himself and his pets\nAt one point he said he became so he's something told them that this was no longer safe and they moved to an inter a bathroom and that happened the windows shattered glass blasted and he said they certainly would have been injured if they had been the case\nAnd he kind of struggled to patch up his window and rode out the rest of the storm and ah today's here repairing his house with a neighbor and I asked him if he was sorry that he said he says no\nDid evacuate is there any kind of timeframe on when they might be able to come home [noise] uh\nNo I don't I'm not not yet as far as I Know when you arrive engulf a county here you get an alert on your cell phone telling you that only for sponsors are allowed in the county at this point that they do that even private even people who live here residents are not allowed back and so there's road blocks that many all the the major intersections\nAnd many many people are being turned away um to their frustration so it's they're worried about the safety because there are still wires down um everywhere here so it's it's it's safety first and it's going to be some\nTime I think for people were allowed back a\nNPR's Greg Allen reporting in Mexico Beach Florida we hope you stay safe thanks so much you walk\nYeah you're

next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be\nSaying we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem a manufacturing problem who knows\nThat and once you know that you can fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plants bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed cranked\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station it's sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want to buy if they ... to\nCome home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough chef that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so\nIt really causes a lot of risk
