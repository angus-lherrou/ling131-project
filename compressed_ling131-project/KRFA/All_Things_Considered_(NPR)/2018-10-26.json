dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you\nEmergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an interest partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and whether as there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we are talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I I'm nobody'd called her national emergency but again what is a national emergency is

get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask you the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energized Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people opposed to a prison hand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports [noise]\nLet me ask you about Congress's role in

contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black space right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation you're after\nThe Christmas at all companies and this one day of the year when all the ... the costuming comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether a blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well walk us\nThrough some of the history of this when did we first started seeing blacks in America\nWe first start things like trees in the early Eighteen hundreds\nMay become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like by people I talked to in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course is mental shows depicted black people would leave the at animal lipstick playoff caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sit next to obviously the broad the human condition that allow slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twentieth century ... and\nThe most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black\n\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face betrayal of Asian American pie and think of Mickey Rooney character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy that against them\nTo push back some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to be black people in missile shows who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about ... ... what do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of the history of particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and the panel is all white and I went to the port and\nShe's going to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about the broader context we always start in a store or vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when he's controversy tend to happen\nIt's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface usually there's not a black person and attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash but then a video\nWith a different context with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery it's well maybe these conversations will be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding the history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team
