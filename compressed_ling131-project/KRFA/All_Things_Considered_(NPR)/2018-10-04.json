Ari Shapiro and I melted Chang in the weeks and Christine Blasey Ford acute Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assault press conference spawn has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when president from mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nDid you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember but where is the place I don't remember how many years\nResponse to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello so as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comment last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nI vote or just a motor users can do as a woman now he\nSeemed to be sort of you in to the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford's seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them used that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really diverting from that line and he was playing it to laugh than cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today some\nHow the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two teeth Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those\n... and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote you know one thing that has\nBeen swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually empathize with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean look look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump adjust the leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise lasted shared\nAnd you know he was really he really seemed to be saying she's an attractive and that wouldn't have happened therefore so the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how

Capitol Hill Hi Scott hey there so the FBI had a full week to do this I haven't used that entire week does that give us any clues about the scope of the report\nWhat we've seen several clues that it's likely on the moral limited side the FBI had a week to do this and as you mentioned they wrapped it up two days early we also know that the White House was directing the FBI and how broadly are narrowly it would focus that report and the White House was able to do that because this is the background investigation not a criminal probe\nSo only one copy of this report will be made available to the entire Senate not one per senator and each party is going to have one hour to look at it what do you make of that I think they're mostly\nDoing it so people like me aren't able to find a copy a committee leadership wants to make sure this won't leak so the report\nIs being held in the secure ruined the Senate uses for confidential information only senators and a half dozen or so staffers with security clearances will be allowed in no notes can come out and nobody's allowed to talk about it\nAnd this is really frustrating Democrats who say this is not a transparent process and that given how the public this is all bend the public should know the conclusion\nHow do Democrats and Republicans feel about that well a lot of top Republicans are just fine with that I asked John Cornyn the number two Republican in the Senate about that says he got into an elevator earlier today\nI don't know that we we heard from ever since I was referring to last\nWeek's public testimony of course

their father\nIs some women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him that would make him cry that someone did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it to the job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\n... is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their
