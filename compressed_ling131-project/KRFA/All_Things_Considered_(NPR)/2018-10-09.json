facial expression or that you know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task you know one recurring\nIssue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that men identified people of color much more frequently than it missed identified white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistake like that happen\nYeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of protests\nFive different races so you're saying there are just a lot more photos of white people in the database to these people are the software read that's exactly right\nSo how do you solve the problem technologically how do you make the Web I get less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nThough either win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups

among them getting young people out to vote which an Kwan Bolden was working on just last night he was back at Florida State in Tallahassee where he went to college to talk with courage students inclined Bolden hey there\nHow are you doing I'm All right how are you holding up down there I guess the hurricane warnings didn't uh didn't interrupt the proceedings down there\nNot just being from Florida you used to hurt and why we're\nSo let me ask you what was your pitch to students last night how do you get young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell first of all you have to let them know that number one vote count 'em and you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about oh more than just the sport that they play\nWith all athletes that you were talking to\nYou have to ... it was all Applebee's okay I'm a I think it's important for Applebee's to use their platform in in the right word but more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of the time the state and local elections that are\nSometimes even more important than your president\nAnd there's the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was urging President Trump to use this clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask a fairly basic question that but what just things like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power has to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from an afro but I Do want to hear from the players who aren't everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's doesn't mean that we are not

NFL\nWhat I Want to be unrealistic and after the people's hearts change towards these issues there's a lot of people who tried to deny what's really going on in our society\nAnd I think if I had my way everybody was the things the way Matthew I'm In that food to see that there is a specific group of people in our country that's not treated fairly and\nArt would be for everybody to see that and for everybody to work together and come up with solutions to try to rectify that problem\nDo you support the rate of current players to take a knee during the anthem\n[noise] of course it's different I think for me and the NFL is a peaceful protests when I'm outside of the protests you have to go into the war\nProtests and during the national anthem only brings attention to the issues but then

that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if an
