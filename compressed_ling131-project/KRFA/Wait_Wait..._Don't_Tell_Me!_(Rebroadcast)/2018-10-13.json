P. B. dot org and the pledge stuff is still up there and you know just because it's folk music doesn't mean doesn't cost it does cost cost for maintenance and equipment and all those things\nAnd and so you do need to um you need you need to be able to figure out what you can afford it you can and help support\nMusic but also those have you on this Saturday and on up and there's talk of a\nOf a special inland folk fundraiser which which is really cool because those are fun to do and we just have a good time doing them and\nEverybody has a little bit of lunch and we do the pleasure island this time it'll be we've never done one from nine to twelve in the morning she how that works\nIt probably all send this year used to carry coffee pots into [laughter] anyway\nSo thanks for everybody for pledging because you know when you think about it it's it's music and you're like certain types of music and you know you really enjoy that but also you got to kind of transcend and know that when you pledge even though you specifically might\nDidn't noted to a certain category or a certain show or whatever it's all about public radio\nAnd without public radio in general you wouldn't have the official in shamrock you wouldn't have inland folk you wouldn't have Sunday baroque you wouldn't have all things considered you wouldn't have\nMORNING EDITION you wouldn't have the b._b._c. you wouldn't have all of those things and so you know you wouldn't have white totally wired you just it wouldn't be there and so ultimately when you pledge even though you're supporting your your thing ultimately it all goes to public\nSo in WB beat out of work for pledging for northwest public radio ... thanks very very much\nAnd you got your loyalties and we cut her eye defense here in ... started up in Spokane spoke in public radio\nIn the end he continued because of the perseverance and the loyalty oath of managers and things here in northwest public radio so I Am very very grateful as well I Am really super grateful already that's enough of that and uh then we will leave it at that\nAnd now we're going here where oh this is a dog ...
