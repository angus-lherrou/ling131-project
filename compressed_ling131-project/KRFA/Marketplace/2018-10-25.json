world in bringing down carbon emissions over the last Twenty years by\nBy our ingenuity and new technology the continued research\nAnd I and I think that is a better way than mandate from Washington DC\nThank you I'm going to have the the question again I'm for your own response and that and it is how do you plan to use the position and Congress to address the very real challenge it presented to our region country and planet by climate change\nProud that eastern Washington is leading the country in the world actually in clean energy solutions and uh\nIt's reliable it's affordable it's really\nPart of what has made us competitive but it's also resulted in us being one of the cleanest green a stake in the country and I have led in hydropower re licensing major legislation that will address how long it takes to license one of our hydro facilities we've invested in\nResearch and new new fish turbans and a fish ladders so that\nThe fish runs now are better today than they were when the dams were first put in dams and fish coexist and we could double\nHydropower electricity without building a new dams simply by investing in New technology I have promoted bio mass we have many beautiful forest in eastern Washington ...\nIs another a solution and and promoting it is something that I've done in Congress hydrogen fuel cells in the end the tax legislation that was passed I helped get a provision in there that will encourage hydrogen fuel cells\nThese are just some of the many solutions that eastern Washington is leading and I am proud to be a champion for all of them and others wind and solar another a battery solutions here that come from eastern Washington\nScience on coal we put into place the rules that allow you to run your meter backwards and incentives for

on this issue\n[noise] thank you we move now to Native American issues a question you each get Ninety seconds to respond and a thirty second rebuttal to the other starting with the least that\nFor many people there only exposure to native communities may be true inaccurate media portrayals of controversies like sports team ... got\nHere in eastern Washington in the northwest Native Americans have deep proud and important ... how would you advocate for the interest of native communities\nAnd respond to President Trump if he were standing next to you using Pocahontas\nAs a derogatory term for a political opponent as he has done many times [noise]\nAh first of all a\nI appreciate it\nBy the Spokane tribe and to have held town hall meetings during this campaign on both the Spokane tribe and the call bill tribe and have met also with the nets per se um and the Kalispell um there's a special unique government to government relationship\nAnd that needs to be respected when it come both to the natural resource issues that tribes are involved in but really other issues as well\nMy opponent voted to weaken the violence against women act specifically to weaken the protections that native women would have on tribal land and this is a step in the wrong direction\nSo if I were I'm standing next to the president's ah I Would um make it clear that the type of name calling that he uses to describe his opponent is unacceptable in a leader\nAnd we need to do better and we certainly can do better\nI'm also a proud of the work or my husband has done for native law and he his mother is a descendant\nPleasure to native communities maybe through inaccurate media portrayals are controversies like fourteen mascot\nHere in eastern Washington in northwest Native Americans had deep proud and important route how would you advocate for the interest of native communities and how would you respond to President Trump if he were standing next to using Pocahontas as a derogatory term for a political opponent like his them anytime\nYou and I have worked with the tribes of eastern Washington and and many others on many issues on the violence against women act a lease it doesn't have a quite right I I have I supported the current policy I supported the legislation that his current law the violence against women act that President Obama signed\nI'm pushing my colleagues right now\nWe did get an extension of that law until the end of the year and have been working in a bipartisan way with my colleagues with friends that I have relationships I have\nDeveloped with some other women on the Democratic side of the aisle to to negotiate you um are dark colleagues push our colleagues to get an agreement in place as soon as possible because we need that\nI have led on legislation to help the tribes that have declared a state of emergency right now because they can\nTypically working with them to get more residencies onto the onto the reservation or ... with working with Indian Health services so that\nWe can get more doctors if we can get more residency there than there are more than they are more likely to stay there and actually practice over a longer period of time which is very important and I let on that legislation and we got signed into law\nI've worked with the tribes on natural resources issues and really highlighted some of their forest health practices that are a model that I think the federal government should follow thank you thirty seconds\nYes first of all with respect to the violence against women act instead of reauthorized and yet it was cynically extended until just after the election so it will depend on who is in the majority in Congress as to what happens next\nAnd caffeine did introduce the substitute bill personally that would have substantially weaken did\nWhen I have met with tribal one of the top issues I've heard about is the importance of high speed Internet they've been left behind especially in our rural communities thirty seconds he'll\nFun of violence against women act I had I have a lead on making sure that it is reauthorized that is ...\nAnd I am confident that we will uh work on that my my colleague W W Dingell actually approached me this summer a Democrat from Michigan and said Kathy let's do this let's get it done in the show America that we can get it done and that's the kind of can do get it done approach that I bring to Congress\n[noise] thank you now we move on to algae B.
