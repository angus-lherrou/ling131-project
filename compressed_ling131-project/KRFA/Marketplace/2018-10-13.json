{"month": "10", "state": "ID", "station": "KRFA", "content": "All right for some perspective on that we are joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the fed board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here for\nThe usual it did for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nBeen very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve on for the country\nTo the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay up until now fed official happened defending the fed is from the president's attack but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evan he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hike\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nUh with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed managing the economy could the president and how the way the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nNo I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them for using the ...\nThat if the president keeps substance attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation so I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting\nIn their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe comes right it could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime chairman power ceases as worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill trying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve\nOversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic installation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nAnd Donald come the former vice
