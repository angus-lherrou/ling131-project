MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dementia and\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind had difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nMost critically has no memory of the circumstances of this crime or things of that the state to execute him for inside\nPunishment in the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles than the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories or creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself or his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely you're in eighth

advanced stages of Alzheimer's what the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who gets a frantic are delusional\nOr go van replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime\nAnd he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder\nAfter the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder\nAnd at some point in time to say look forward to being able to obtain the punishment with the trial judge

was suspended\nOther researchers in recent years have lost their jobs over sexual harassment that's progress as Jane Lou an astronomer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory\nI think that's the right direction but it's different from being respected for a one expertise\nLew says she's experienced all kinds of sexism for example whenever she went to visit the telescope\nWould have a ... and it will mail because
