been very successful in recent years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment\nBut the fed success has also undermined one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years that Philips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips curve if you put it in a murder mystery\nFramework or who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard the president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds wrong persistent focused on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable and\nWorking but rumors of its death maybe exaggerated it certainly still invoked during the debates within

him\nThe reason inflation is staying low\nWhat is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nThe U.S economy is extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response owing thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that would come from your belief about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say give me low and stable inflation\nEven if it means the Philips curves is dead John Ydstie NPR News Washington
