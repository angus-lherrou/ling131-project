diversity and I'd love to eat and Asians policies change not to have raised for that\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences [noise] would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering one at assessing students qualifications\nYeah I think that because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on I think\nThe single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents learn missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal ratings artificially keep their numbers lower although they were scoring higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans all to the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and successful is really likely to how white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI Do think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian American under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something but Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people\nThe ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of idea\n[noise] so I think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that\nMarriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at married in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application my cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you're just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nI Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits of it are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to racial ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a fertile division and sort of diversity for the sake of diversity\nA day on the basis of race well ... thank you so much for talking with us today they stretch for having me she is a
