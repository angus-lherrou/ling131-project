slowly because a lot of times you find yourself just throwing away not really thinking about it and you're practicing slowly I mean you've probably been told that a lot if you're a musician by anybody

actually my parents met\nUm my dad was huge and ... and into collecting vinyl my mom was too but uh they were at a social gathering at college\nAnd um my my dad looks over and there's this there's this girl looking through his vinyl and first he freaked out because he was collecting that into his favorite thing and then it was like but it's like I'm going to go and talk to her\nUm and so now our our entire living room as sort of turned into this big library of vinyl records that my dad as sort of turned into as he called it the listening room um and yeah so it's it's quite literally been to the center of our household and you guys were hurting the listening rooms sometimes I guess redo wide sometimes\nUm yeah I really like to fly the thing is really the best really is mixed it the

dean for foreign tourists by Maxine park Thirteen Years old or piano from Hanover New Hampshire Maxine you tackle that music was such great confidence but when you were younger you say that you were afraid of the\nSpotlight yeah so my first is title\nI playing doodle with my mom you know what to do it and I play in the military part on the top registering the piano and I'm On the plane they come to met on the bottom register um but I thought the audience to close so I wanted my mom to play the bottom part of the top part says that she could hide me from the audience that I could just plan of action\nUm yeah that didn't work out too well but [laughter]\nBut uh your mom is also somebody who's contributed a great thing I Wish somebody that\nSo my mom used to tell me a lot when I was little don't compare yourself to other people because you'll never be happy with how you do you're just trying to do better than somebody else all the time\nUm so I Can't remember the the the word no social comparison um and that's really helped me a lot with piano especially because when I go up to play or even to practice I'm thinking about what do I want to do to improve my past self not trying to improve based on somebody else or something like that [noise]\nUm and also when I perform I can just go up there and have fun because I'm not really worried about doing better than something or having a stern outcome so I can just have fun\nStrong with them we should learn from the beautiful your parents are both avid amateur piano and there's a joke about what you have to do to be a member of your family [noise]\nYeah so my parents met in college and my dad is playing a shiny minor concerto um\nAnd my mom was off the plane that concert at the time 'cause she came over to talk to them and at first he thought that he was in processing heard like plaintiff he's turned out she was a much better candidate than he was um [laughter] but\nUm [noise] so there's a joke in my family that you have to play one of the two Chopin concerto is either the F ... fighter because they both play both of those concerto [noise]\nUm and so I'm not a member of the family yet but I'm working on it which one are you working on I'm working on that flight are my favorite too\nWell I guess I don't really know right now one of the things that my parents have kind of taught me is that you don't have to play professionally in order to still love it and enjoy it\nI'm definitely still want to keep playing piano and enjoying it when I get older um but I think it really depends a lot on like the people you meet because I've met a lot of Ventura to have changed my perspective and the things that I wanted to do though I don't know maybe I Will become a professional Canada or maybe not really for it\nThat's for sure I'm actually and it was such a pleasure hearing you and I hope we get to hear you again sometime you back vaccine back and forth there\n[noise] back\nOn stage with me now is the
