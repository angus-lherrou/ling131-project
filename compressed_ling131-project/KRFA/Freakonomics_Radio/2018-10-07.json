violinist violist chose and basis who show up every year in Kalamazoo the home of the soul Burke\nI sat down for a brief conversation with Margaret Hamilton the executive director of the competition after the semi final round to help set the scene Margaret telling me briefly the history of this job or competition and why it's for ... years it's really an honor of much below violinist and teacher yes\nYou are so right it's in honor of Julius Spellberg who was a long time resident of Kalamazoo\nMusic faculty member here at western Michigan University School of music directed the Kalamazoo junior symphony for decades and died unexpectedly or too soon in Nineteen Seventy four\nAnd it was his family and friends and community members who literally gathered around Esther Spellberg kitchen table saying how do we commemorate the life of this man\nSo they came up with the notion of a competition and they hoped at that point in time that it might last for five years but Julius had extraordinary ties to the greater string community at of course his work with strings students he was the violin professor at was legendary here\nHow many kids apply every year this year we had an all time record broken we received over two hundred applications so each year it's been growing and I believe that there are a number of reasons word of mouth happy contestants happy parents extraordinary performances that come out of this\nBut the support of audiences here in Kalamazoo community\nA young person will apply anywhere between the middle of October to our February first deadline and then those applications go through two rounds of screening here in Kalamazoo it's an anonymous process\nSo if we take this year's numbers as an example those two hundred applicants were whittled down to the twelve semi finalists that we heard today how is that even possible\nI mean you know just you know the proof is in the ... of course the twelve that I heard today we're more artist then competitors I think\nUh so what does that process like or do you have a a hair splitting moment you know getting them down from two hundred or is it fairly obvious I mean the the level must be astronomical\nAt this I think the level is astronomical and I'm always grateful that I Am not the person making those decisions are screeners who do remain anonymous they are well versed in the literature and the profession or in what the field\nTake that as you can imagine there are some really tough calls made at the end\nAnd what is a ... when a kid's apply until how old can they be\nUh our rules call for them to be age Nineteen or under as of January first of the competition here\nSo the kids you work with are very much eligible to appear on from the top as a matter of fact this year there's a large\nOverlap yes there is a huge overlap and I think that's what brought us together and we've noticed that overlap over the years that alumni from the top also ended up being alumni as the Spellberg it's a wonderful connection and of course the missions are so similar\nTo what we've had a wonderful or you've had a wonderful legacy on from the top with all the kids that we always send a shout out to the store bird for for your support and a good knowledge of this great great talent so thanks for talking with me in a best of luck with this year's competition\nWell thank you and
