to pump pale or any other American officials were waiting for the outcome of the investigation that was launched by our stumbled prosecutors' offices\nCritics say from the beginning Turkey's attempt to present this as a straightforward criminal investigation was undermined by its invitation to the Saudis to join in Saudi investigators have been in on every major search so far sometimes arriving well ahead of the Turkish team\nUs based turkey analyst Soner trapped I told the al Jazeera networks English Channel that Turkish president Recep Tayyip air to one needs to see this late at the

continuing stability in the world oil market but at the moment that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... said something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to speak next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves\nHe is David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those rights around the world they became wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate ... disappearance and perhaps murder\nKnow it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before we've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts maybe led by a former priests\nOnce they should get access to the consulate they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it\nPretty quickly I think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically theoretically maximum\nFive people\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work ... she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago he said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate are you confident you would get access to the places you need to go to the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leaking to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then what happens\nAt the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they couldn't ignore it I think that would be um something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think is a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can invest\nCertainly can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible you'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of\nThe Saudis blaming somebody in in the government and it seems that the U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not a that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution that was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for\nHolding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included\nStates like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of think forward\nDavid Cay he is un special wrap our tour on freedom of opinion and expression and thanks very much thank

Sunday\nI'm only going to take some time I was telling you they're almost the Republican running for ... I'm I'm here answering questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen they know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised here in Paris or from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask for their out if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as the people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political\nGood different platform than the one the Trump Administration is pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is what I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the ... election or Doug ... on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you were approached do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may make calls for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nUnder that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nTruck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way that\nThey see what's going on they see how they treat us and\nI tell my kids you got to vote you got to vote you got to raise the vote and they said that we were ready to go where there are\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy there'll be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]\n\nListening to all things considered from NPR News\nAnd this has Minnesota Public radio news it's three forty

Seventy is it possible that more names will be added\n[noise] yes it is um I just spoke to this afternoon with just ... she's an attorney with the Hennepin County public defender's office now she told me that it's possible after they conduct their own investigation\nThat they will find additional cases in which they feel surfing played a critical role and if that is disputed by prosecutors then they're just going to have to work something out in court now now what about a detective syrup and is he still working for the Eden Prairie police department\n[noise] yes at our last check this week

year all over the country but Minnesota stands out from most other states because it has multiple races up and down the ballot that are getting national attention\nAnd that means a lot of money spent on political ads reporter Catherine Richard is in our studio in Rochester to tell us about some of the television and Web ads\nYou may have seen and how to spot bogus information online Hi Katherine\nHi Stephen all those ads costs money can you tell us how much has been spent so far\n[noise] well it's hard to come up with a specific total that includes every single race in Minnesota because those numbers are kept in two separate databases and frankly it's changing daily as we get closer and closer to the election\nBut as a earlier this week at least Seventy four million dollars has been spent so far this cycle by candidates and groups on eight Minnesota U.S House of representatives seats and two Senate seats that number does not include contest for state office the money has been spent on television ads\nOnline ads and all of those mailers that are probably clogging up your mailbox right now\nFor those who had been tuning these ads out for the most part what are they like\nWell I've spent a decade covering politics and several of those years were spent specifically covering campaign spending an ad suggests like these and I can say that on balance we're seeing more negative and misleading ads than we have in the house can you give us some examples\nWell sure here are two ads running in the tight race for Minnesota's first congressional district first we'll hear from the national Republican congressional committee a ... it's an ad against DFL or dance\nPlayer Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem\nEven should Kaepernick new measures the patriotism of our most\nThem for you we stand together\n[noise] of course the important fact this ad omit is that fee and himself as a veteran and served two tours in Iraq in the Democratic congressional campaign committee has this ad airing against being GOP opponent Jim Hackett or\nWould you showed her head towards reports of Washington plan that would allow insurance companies drug protections for people with preexisting conditions\nWanting national fact checking website politifact said the bill this ad references could weaken protections for people with preexisting conditions\nAnd back in twenty Seventeen had a dorm wrote on his website that he supports this bill but he's not in Congress and haven't voted on that bill and this bill has not been made law Katherine what else have you seen that it's questionable\nWell there was a social media I mean just this week circulated by a right leaning group called right now and then\nIt photo shop attorney general candidate Keith Ellison which the group were first you as Keith acts Alison it's a reference I Believe to Malcolm X. who was also a Muslim and senators any ... and Tina Smith into a picture of the homeless encampment in Minneapolis\nThe picture is completely fabricated and it appears to have been taken down as if this afternoon [noise]\nCan you tell us more about the group behind that ad\nWell here's what I Know a man who leads a market research firm in Minnesota named Eliot Olson started the group\nAnd also founded right now usa a man named Louis force Hill who is a descendant of the railroad magnate James Jay Hill is bankrolling this group and it's spent more than two hundred thousand dollars on website services provided by a company called Eighteen fifty four Inc\nNow that company appears to have been created\nMen and right now usa websites the group is also spent a fair amount on these services I'm an attorney named Richard Morgan who supported Republicans in the past and that's really where the paper trail ends now I called him left messages for the people involved in this group today but I haven't heard back\nThe here's went all of this is really important after an election when so much false information was intentionally spread on social media to influence voting the case of right now and then it's a really good example of how difficult it can be to track these activities and the ... of these political groups\nNow you mentioned a photo shop at do you have any tips on how to spot an ad with false information or like that one from right now and then\nIf there's a photo like this Alison ad check to make sure that all the people pictured look like they're standing in the same light if it looks a little off right click on the photo and save it and then up all of the picture and should Google Images that search will turn up any photos that could have been photoshopped to create this fake ad\nYou can also copy and paste suspicious headlines into a Google Search and if it doesn't come up wealth elsewhere it's probably fall right helpful\nInformation thank you Catherine thank you Steven ended up the we heard back from a lawyer for right now and and but he could not answer our questions about that\nType twenty eight noted friday among the nod election related headlines of the day the city of diluted estimates that a storm earlier this month

dot org is our Web address\nThe world comes at you fast on air on line on your phone at all things considered we cut through the clutter and take you beyond the headlines there's more to every story listen every afternoon just\n\nThis is your Twin Cities forecasted should be clear this evening becoming partly cloudy with some isolated ranch hours after midnight tonight lows in the mid thirties wins northwest ten to Fifteen gusting to around thirty miles per hour\nNow they're breezy day on Saturday colder but sunny with high in the lower forties northwest wins Fifteen to twenty five miles per hour\nNo reaction yet some eyebrows had been raised a when they decided to investigate this jointly with the Saudis they've been in on every search a but we'll have to wait and see what the reaction is\nAll right that is Peter Kenyon getting us up to speed from ... thank you very much Peter thanks very Lewis and we're going to hear now from someone who says this Saudi investigation is compromise that Saudi Arabia has in effect been investigating itself\nHis name is David Cay he is the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression which means he's tasked with protecting those very rights around the world K. has been arguing that the UN should launch an independent international investigation and he's on the line now David Cay welcome\nThanks for having\nNow that Saudi Arabia has come out and confirmed or the death of ... ... showed G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what ...\nWould be worthwhile would be necessary\n[noise] absolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal details\nOf uh of ... killing and\nThose seem really quite at odds with what a what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fistfight to em seems really um counter to what to do what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nUh is to have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation look like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this\nMaybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation\nAnd um you know at the very minimum it can involve\nAnalyzing what the what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two or it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this ... ...\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations for for heinous crimes and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide uh they did it in the context\nTo go and they've done it and many other places the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject to add to the veto of any of the five\nPermanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary that could block of Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and said why not\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international lies it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its\nDiplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing by day and I'm not talking about you know but we're talking about a credible international investigation that David Cay thank you\nThank you use the un special ... and this is NPR News\nThe Hennepin
