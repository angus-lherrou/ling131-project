Shapiro and I'd also Chang in the weeks since Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know and today in the White House briefing\nRoom for secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIs Christine Blasey Ford or just the motor users can do it for the first woman now he\nSeemed to be sort of hewing to the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be hearing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her a and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really the verging from that line and he was playing it to laugh and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today some\nHow the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote you\nKnow one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nIn one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to uh\nAnd you know he was really he really seem to be saying she's an attractive and that wouldn't have happened there for so the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nSo right now he's got some uh late rain\nIn the

emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yup ...\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife of forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have

that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone\nUm so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time and good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also but it's important for daughters she told her father's about the sort of have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and the the cabin up for hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave\nOr whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really

has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that\nWell we think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace\nAnd then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser grossly undervalued some of the properties\nRuss ... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us\nToday Thanks for having me or the New York times story you just heard it now says that Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or is simply lacked the resources to do so real estate\nCompanies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax funding as usual is one thing to have had a self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years that doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades is simply lack the resources to pull out\nOf political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been no with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns as now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources they are not going to be allocating and tort gift tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat cares to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transactions involving the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth than twenty sixteen but\nBecause Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it\nAnd why use Dan severe arose as if frog was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe as as the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump
