acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenged last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not at federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at the state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map a a an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAren't big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are kept him the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that naming off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it as you know Michelle just character assassination if you have ever missed the tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money it's\nThe country and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but what's also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists name Scott Wallace who's never run for office before and he poured millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nWell because it's an extraordinary you're\nNot just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations and away from the Ninety nine percent but just the moral tone of our country I've got three kids are going to raise a kid and this atmosphere this influence coming from the White House it's destructive of the fabric\nOf our moral core in America and destructive of democracy the assaults on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI our intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and all very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of it here the\nOn a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue\nThat ties all of us together as money in politics my opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate tax money I refused to take a dime\nHe's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money on this and I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business from getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not get\nOf Wall Street predatory lending when you want gun control the ... amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests stops every single thing that the people want you know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district and expensive media markets like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached\nAnd so that tells the candidate boats\nAnd so yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voice is going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in your campaign\nIs he's huge I mean I I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate\nThe tone so he's not on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in a in a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging\nHe goes around the country singer vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election and of course interest is much higher and a presidential election and the reality is this is the first chance that voters in this district in everywhere in the country have to express their feelings\nSupport for Minnesota
