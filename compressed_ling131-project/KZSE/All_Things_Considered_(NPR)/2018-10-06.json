their lack of any empathy or more for what they have put them through\nWhat let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and his got because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine Blasey Ford sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about\nThat they did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often in in strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing that Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up\nThey said they believe that something happened to her but either that they didn't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the one who assaulted her\nOr that they just didn't see any evidence backing for it up on that claim that was the final view from

circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford\nThe woman who told the Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether for it a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they had been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country is tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet the the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move this country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter a have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now or at least it makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and\nPeople making the decision so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all the facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information\nAnd so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect\nOn both parties are made it there is some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms than they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that [noise]\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given\nA voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and this is going to be an important\nMoment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has raised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people\nAnd it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nA minimum wage increase for upwards of three
