contributed to do this or rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks\nThat's made the market nervous in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable a and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually\nAnd as you suggested will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go\nThere are a some inflation concerns but they're\nRelated to the very very

these concerns about a global trade war a disrupting the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China\nStill what we saw today is this could this be the beginning ... long downward trend\nMost analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling\nGiven the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high
