Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the euro rate is less than one of 'em\nNow the president wants to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts and we have a Native American ancestry you're better\nSo you you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nAnd can also here or at least who one of members have been told an audience of that video is the president himself a lady responded to although he has\nAnd you know weren't really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were debate to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this\nDollars\nFor trouble if you take the test so that shows your\n[noise]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up with a million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied making that promise even though as you all heard we just heard or the late ... and the war with after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with a B aspirations we mentioned but she's on a run for president\nHerself in twenty twenty I think that's a really realistic God's at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHis taken to calling her Pocahontas so this has really hit an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty funny races going to kick off pretty much just in his mid\nTerm very briefly has quieted all of those of us it's ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered questions All right so

that but he certainly is offering an alternative theory of the case although he did not explain how road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and um\nKilled somebody in there but I think you see that his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times that the king flatly denied it he firmly denied it and we've seen this pattern before when he took ... quote strong denials that Russia didn't interfere\nIn the twenty sixteen elections he even offered an alternative theory of the case back then when he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on a bed might have hacked the Democrats emails so that's his instinct to basically to protect defend it\nThe update on the four hundred pound guy yesterday okay and I mentioned the president was on his way to Florida Today I it's very common of course for president to visit a disaster area but in Florida a few weeks before an election what are the politics of a presidential visit\nWell this was an official visit but it definitely had a political component because two of the most important races the cycle or in Florida the governor's race of course very important to Trump that a Republican remain governor there for twenty twenty for Trump's own reelection\nAnd also the current governor Rick Scott is the Republican nominee for Senate and if Democrats can't keep the Senate seat in Florida they probably have no chance of taking over the majority there\nBut the president did meet with Governor Rick Scott he praised him normally natural disasters are a very positive political opportunity for incumbent governors because they have the resources and executive powers that non incumbent slack they can be a acting helping people really keeping in the spotlight\nAsk you about one of the big issues in the Florida Senate race this is the red algae bloom the spin following the state's be choose and which is tied to warmer waters that come with climate change and the

Trump critic\nIn fact on the Senate floor the day after that rally fast took issue with the president's behavior while explaining his own concerns about the debate over the nominee I spoke with Ben Sasse earlier today about political divisiveness it's the subject of his new book them we started with what happened with the Kavanaugh hearings and his take on the me too movement\nThe me too movement is a very important movement it's messy and it's complicated and there are places where it's going to overreach and we haven't fought throughout a process all of the due process issues but fundamentally I think we have a culture of\nSexual assault in this country for decades we don't have a shared sexual aspect and the me too movement is very very important and we need to handle it with a lot more delicacy than something you can handle well at a campaign rally so that was an unfortunate move\nBut what's your response to many conservative and Republican women out there who have talked about this idea of him to movement that they're worried about their sons that\nYou know they've kind of moved from one part of the conversation to apart that says men are at a disadvantage here that there are radical feminist women who were coming after men in your life with false allegations\nSo saying don't let people eat dinner with their kids that's wrong\nI'm Dr Ford's family and Brett Kavanaugh's family both suffered repeated death threats over the course of the one month circus that the Senate conducted I'm a politician who has to for a time serve in public life and I get death threats and it is what it is because\nYou put yourself out there in the public square but if you're going to serve under traditionally or if you're going to raise allegations about sexual violence in the past the fact that we don't just have those people suffering death threats having to move out of their homes\nOn but we also have other politicians calling on people who might differ with on policy to be handed out of restaurants that is not like behavior\nWhat is your response to the activists who says if you are paid by me the taxpayer in ICU in public it's perfectly fine for me to tell you what I think it's perfectly fine for you to be held accountable for policies that are harmful\n... this is why I wrote them most fundamentally because political tribalism is ramping in our time\nThere are all sorts of important debates that need to be had inside politics but the idea that politics should swallowed the whole public square\nThe idea that there is no civil society that

those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good contact credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nCollected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states\nSo when the higher

week has gone by without one of his colleagues sometimes a Republican sometimes a Democrat confessing to him that they wonder if quote they're wasting their lives\n... says his constituents are frustrated too lamenting about why things don't get done in Washington\nBut more distressing linked to the Nebraska Republican is that these voters seem to be more intent on assigning blame it's a trend he worries about in his new book them why we hate each other and how to heal earlier we heard from him about the divisive confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh\nNow I wanted to ask him a little more about why he things things have gotten to this point\nYou know things are bad right I mean there's data that shows twenty twenty five years ago about fourteen percent of Americans thought the other political party was evil\nProgramming is supported by near a a new kind of precision pain clinics that pinpoints pain at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing nearer clinics dot com but the really\nInteresting things happen in your family and your neighborhood in your workplace in your local worshipping community and right now so many of those local tribes of textured meaning er and collapse and people are looking for substitute tribes and politics and I don't think that's going to work out very well\nYou talk about the idea of red and blue jerseys you also talk about um cable news being a problem social media being a problem um why is it cable news or something to pick out in particular\nWhat we don't have enough shared facts right and so the business model of a lot of different media consumption right now is about trying to deepen and intensify the anger against that you can find in your one percent news tribe\nThat maybe it's worth back up and just looking about what the dissenter mediation of media has done in the Nineteen fifties when there were only three channels or Seventy percent of American households every week tuned into I Love Lucy that wasn't important content but it was shared content\nSo when you think about the MSNBC and the Fox News I'm sort of tribes in the world they're each getting about one percent of the American public\nBut it's a deep and intense one percent that doesn't think there's really any need to reach across the divide and have any sense of ... that's a really unhelpful set of economic incentives that cause us to silo ourselves off from our neighbors\nAnd you go on those shows you don't have to\nA fair point you've got to talk to Nebraska is however you can get to um I live in Nebraska but that's on weekends and so in DC Monday to friday I fly off to my day job and Nebraska's a small place but it's still one point nine million people across the Ninety three counties and a couple of times zones a four hundred and fifty miles east to west so you want\nOver you can get to them but right now it would be a lot more useful if we had a sense of we which bridged across some of those one percent of our lives\nSo I'm not picking on you for going on cable I think\nYou gotta do what you got to do but it seems like lawmakers have a hand in this right if they are red and blue jerseys you guys are handing them out and the elephant in the room so to speak would be maybe the president Donald Trump right people talk a lot about his language and his rhetoric how is that not divisive are contributing to the problem\n[noise] sure so I've been critical of the president or on a number of these points but I think it's also important for us to recognize that what we're struggling with right now didn't start two years ago this isn't about Donald Trump Donald Trump or no other politician can fix it either this is not a two year old problem this is a two plus decades problem in the making\nBut can I come back to this point because I think you know lawmakers contribute to divisiveness the way you talk to each other the way you talk about each other the way you talk about us as voters the way you talk about activists I'm we hear people being described as evil as mobs right [noise]\nI I think I mean you're surely right there's a lot of blame to go around and that kind of people we have serving in politics right now have become a tribes of people who think politics or the center of life and I think ... to ... you know if I could give a message to American voters\nOr don't elect people who think politics or the most important venue in American Life politics are getting a really important\nUm but it's a place to do specific things to maintain a framework for or to liberty so that communities of love and persuasion and volunteerism can actually thrive in the flower\nThe things that make Americans happy or do you have a nuclear family do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful calling you have shared work do you have shared vocations do you have local worshipping communities all of those things are connected to place\nAnd places being undermined by the digital revolution right now given this great stuff and the desserts\nA bit of being anchored in a place and we've got more and more politicians who go off to Washington DC and they never really plan to leave Washington DC or the cable news stratosphere they never really plan to go back home those kinda people aren't rooted in grounded and they're not going to make very good leaders for a republic\nSo you don't sound all that excited to be a politician and yet people talk about you are in terms of uh maybe running for president one day they'll laugh about that you don't sound that excited to be fair I\nI think politics has a very useful role to play but it's about a framework for to liberty it's about the frame right in the picture for him but the middle of the frame is American families thriving and working with their neighbor and disagreeing over the dinner table sedans\nAlliances because you know you you were you treated someone who was saying oh I regularly consider leaving the Democratic party you basically said oh yeah I feel the same only about being a Republican\nYeah I don't think either of these parties has a long term view right now I think both of these parties are mostly trying to do anti tribe\nNot what are you for what are the Democrats' big unhealthy long term visions and what are the Republicans big unhealthy ten and twenty year long visions but both parties spend most of their time trying to explain why the other party is even worse than they are\nAnd uh I think the two party system was not what the founders intended and I don't think it's what we are going to have forever but right now we're locked into a two party World War both of these\nI'm sort of do ... are pretty content to just run against each other and tried to hold down any discussion about new and constructive policy ideas going forward but I think voters want better than that\nDo you want to be one of the choices are we going to see on the ballot", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Rochester", "day": "15"}
