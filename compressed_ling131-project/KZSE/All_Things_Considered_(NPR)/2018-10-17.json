multiple counts of sexually assaulting teenage girl\nSixty year old David Edward Campbell is now facing prison time aren't Brandt Williams was in the courtroom as the guilty verdicts were announced and he joins me now with the latest from our Minneapolis beer and one note this report does contain graphic descriptions of the crimes\nSo brand first give us more details of what Campbell was convicted of doing\nWell Campbell was convicted of a total of seven felonies and they all took place during last year they include five counts of criminal sexual conduct which is more commonly referred to as sexual assault he was convicted of one count of threatening the girl with violence and one count of stocking which is also a felony\nNow some of the incidents happened while Campbell was on duty and in uniform and the evidence in the case included a transcript of an interview between the girl and a social worker and during that interview she described a time when Campbell took her on a late night ride in his squad car or\nHe stopped in a secluded park in northeast Minneapolis she said he ... he started to touch her breasts in the car then he told her to get out\nAnd it gets more graphic from there and I won't go into more detail ah Campbell had also bought underwear from Victoria's Secret for the girl and he asked her to take pictures of herself wearing it and then later send the pictures to him\nHow did Campbell come to know this teenage girl in the first place\nWith a girl was dating his son and she'd also come to live with that Campbell family now both prosecution and defense describe the girl was having some problems at home and they point out that a Campbell's wife had received a power of attorney over the girl\nOn the Kimble family was living in hotels last year and the charges include details of an assault which took place at one of those hotels did Campbell actually get fired from the police department when he was charged\nNo ah Campbell was relief from duty without pay and then he retired and I was told by the head of Minneapolis police union that Campbell will still receive pension benefits even though he is now a convicted felon\nAs you would have indicated in your reporting on this case sprint Campbell chose to have the evidence weighed by a judge and not by a jury out why would that be\nYou know I still don't know and chemicals defense attorney Dan homestead wouldn't tell me at the time when I asked him he said he didn't want to make his defense strategy public instead\nThey opted for a trial with no lie witnesses and the evidence was agreed upon and submitted to the court and the closing arguments were submitted and writing\nAnd as you can imagine a jury trial would likely involve testimony from the girl maybe members of camels family and you know maybe it was just that Campbell didn't want to put his family through that did he say anything in court today after he was pronounced guilty\nHe did not uh and I didn't hear him say a word or react in any way as a judge ticked off each guilty verdict is a defense attorney Dan homestead also declined to comment as well so Campbell's going to prison now yeah\nSupport for

everyone the same for Farrington says that's why they're working\nAcross the country some Fifteen states are teaching new ways of treating women prisoners\nGender response of corrections is built around the understanding that women prisoners are different they're less likely to come to prison for violent crimes in prison are less likely than men to be violent but the discipline system in prison is set up to control violent men so those rules country women more harshly weren't fairly\nIt's an insight that came out of decades of academic research from feminist historians sociologist another academics from women consultants who specializes in prisons and from that minority of women who made a career in corrections like Maggie Burke\nShe was the warden of a women's prison in Illinois but she too started as a corrections officer at a men's prison\nYou do a firearms your very first week of training and then that screens everybody out you can't pass with a weapon then you can't do the job and and I'm going to tell you that you know twenty nine years in the department and I've never had to use me then\nThe second thing she says corrections officers learn how to use hand cops\nSo that kind of set people up with an expectation that the work we're doing is physical\nSpare military but the work we're doing is talking to people in the changing lives and you don't do that by barking orders you don't do that by forcing people to do something\nAbout Seventy five the Ninety percent of women in prison had been victims of sexual or physical violence when a corrections officer especially if it's a man yells or parks and order the woman's reaction is often defensive she might just shut down or she might yell back and that can result in a ticket she gets disciplined\nTypically when you tell them in to do something a male and he he's either going to do it or is that he's not going to let off steam he's not going to talk that there isn't a whole lot of emotion to it\nBroke worked in men's and women's prisons\nWhereas with women emotion is in their\nThis sounds like a generalization but we heard it over and over from experts on women's prisons\nAnd she's just like go ahead write me a ticket it just feels a fire and so then it's an emotional ticket\nPrison guards are trained to keep it made under control women in our society in general are expected to be compliant and if they push back which in prison they do more than men officers use that tool they have ... control they hand out punishment now\nShe's got influenced 'cause she's talking back at me and maybe she said something that I can perceive is threatening and I'm going to write you know that she threatened me\nNPR on the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states\nWe estimated rates of punishment for men and women and our numbers show that women typically get disciplined at higher rates for the more minor violations of prison rules\nOften uh twice or three times the rate for men for those smaller things like disobeying a corrections officer or cursing or talking back [laughter] who send the Gillum as a prisoner of the I Will correctional institution for women serving time for robbery\nYou know go she get into a lot of trouble for talking back once a corrections officer made an announcement on the overhead speaker for the women to be quiet but ... says she was on another part of the cell block and didn't hear it\nWhile I was coming from upstairs and I have to end up and I said what was that and he said hey I said no talk and whatever and now it's like well you don't have to yeah and I let him down here and he made a comment on our side while this is America I can say what I Want [laughter] and he wrote me up for it so my response that smart Adel al Awlaki and I got to a major report\nTypically when women prisoners by weight rules even a lesser violation that can lose privileges like getting visits are using the phone they can go to solitary confinement or have days added to their time in prison\nNow the president in Iowa trains officers that if it's not a security issue that some of those things go de escalate situations that we the tickets\nBecause the officer is the new ones that I notice they they talk to us more they interact with is more the access how we doing not trying to be our friend but realized that where people are though we've made mistakes they get ourselves here you know they they're kinder\nAnd ... says that's changing the way corrections officers responded to her health premature\nShe's been taking college classes and once you leave prison next year she wants to complete her degree and get a job counseling people recovering from substance abuse as states start implementing these new ways of treating women there is a small amount of research that shows women like who send the Gillum then do better when they leave prison\nSo are there lessons in this women's reform to make prison were better for men to Becky Nate thanks so women lead the way yes she's a pioneer of gender response of corrections she
