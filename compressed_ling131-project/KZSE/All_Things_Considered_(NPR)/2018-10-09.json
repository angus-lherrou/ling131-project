NPR News Washington\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News acute flash ... mile light is it's rare but in the news and it's our Tuesday topic with Dr John ...\n[noise]\nSix cases of a disease that has been like into polio ever appeared in the past few weeks in Minnesota according to the department of health it's called a F andme or acute flash ... mile light as it causes weakness even paralysis and the arms and legs all six cases are in children under the age of ten\nChris areas of the Minnesota department of health has called it quote\nA less than a one in a million situation\nOr Dr John ... from the U. of M. is here with more on a FM John welcome back Tom thanks so had you heard of this before the last couple of weeks\nOh gosh no I don't think any of us in primary care of ever heard of this condition I think you have to be a pediatric neurologist to be familiar with it very very rare and what's causing until we know what we think it's due to a kind of internal virus so this is a virus that normally live in our guts\nBut for whatever reason it has been causing a upper respiratory infections and all of these cases the kids were sick before they got these symptoms and\nIt just looked like a you know probably a bad cold\nAnd that virus is generally related to the polio virus when we very clear it's not polio let's talk about that because it's been called holy like and I think a lot of people here that and and it's kind of frightening\nThat's right so people were old enough to have experience in sort of you know terror of polio not swimming pools and not going to lakes and you know because we knew that was spread sort of through water it's an oral fecal root thing\nI'm only in that regard you know the fact that this is a virus that in the gut normally but it's you know it's becoming an upper restaurant\nThey are not the same virus they are not the same condition\nWhat is the effect on the body though is it similar to polio well\nThe name sort of says it this acute flats in my life so it's a cute to see what happens quickly and it causes this weakness primarily in the arms and legs but it can also progress to things like facial expression and you've been part of the faces drew being very very dramatic when you see it\nSo the disease is serious absolutely what six cases here or does that make it a serious public health situation\nWell I think the thing that's important about this is that number one we have maybe a case of a year in state of Minnesota you know there are little outbreaks around the country often in the single digits four cases here one year nine cases there another year\nBut I think it's a kind of thing where we want to have it on our medical collective radar you know that that because this is out there I think it's good for us to be aware of this that if we see a young child come to the office with this\nYou know we in health care at least half another within parents maybe in the back of their minds and teachers are just going to talking to the way and thinking about it um so it's it's something we need to be aware of but very rare thank goodness\nAnd a question I had for you as a as a family physician if it is so rare how would you diagnose you probably never come across a case\nRight I mean I think if you know parents are listening to a thing gosh this is so rare we've never seen a case when even know what the name of this thing is the the reality is if if I open the door and I know that there's a kid who's sick in my clinic\nAnd you know their faces through being or they can't stand on their leg and you know this is something it just strikes me like this is something that is serious and we need to move forward\nThere's an expression of medicine that when you hear hoof beats you think horses but you needed things zebras also at times and so this is one of those cases in it we rely on clinical judgment whether it's a clinic or an emergency room we know these kids are sick and they need immediate attention\nWhat sort of treatment or is there there's no vaccine for this is known that yet and there's no thanks\nWhere we need to provide supportive care physical therapy will be something that we get going pretty quickly with conflict is because we need to try and restore their their motor muscle function um but right now unfortunately really isn't a improved treatment for this\nDr John ... is our regular medical analysts and he's an associate professor in the department of family medicine and community health at the University of Minnesota and John thanks
