people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service ... name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor wrestle ... said he that he held a special surface to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is fine but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way cannot be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today I guess yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation\nUm some people are afraid to put to target on her back and\nI open and affirming you mean other than every once in a while because everyone is welcome to sexual right everyone is welcome and and knowing welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of\nAh folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer their words of Thanksgiving they did not stay to worship but they did come and to say thank you for doing this so that makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I didn't have to wonder you I mean you hear you my daughter um\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events because he was a police officer in white whole nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives\nSo it was very frightening for us personally um but I I Try to ... the urge to give me the bull ... that I Need\nI I Do not fear for my show I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my

during worship and for her yesterday's attacks on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony was ... was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of a situation like that and of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible for\nEight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating and different the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it so I was running through my head tenants plans that I've come up for years really\nAnd is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened were you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school\nOr things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days I don't know\nYou know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking and\nWe also met a father and son oldest and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today and oldest said his
