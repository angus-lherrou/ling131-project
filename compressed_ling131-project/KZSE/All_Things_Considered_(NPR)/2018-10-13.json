secure\nFor instance release at one point Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees latest hands on the president and prayed that that President Trump be

president\nRegimen type air to one uh he'd been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course um there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all

closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential

percent minorities that are pending\nRain can running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas the voting system does she have a history of getting involved with

close we have seen that there are these voters on pending lists\nAnd we have seen Georgia passed a photo ID law before you couldn't vote however in Georgia the way our elections work as the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing ... elections in enforcing state laws regarding\nProcesses are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easier to vote and follow Georgia's law and in fact this week we reported a Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including\nWell over two hundred thousand new voters just in the may primary election\nWhat's the mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is motivating Democrats who feel

think I can do in my purse\nAnd\nSarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program thank you for having me and us we're not moving here [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women who's a former cop who admits to using you know prosecuted women\nOr as he says never on the clock though you know never what while I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nYou know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth in value are determined by\nMy parents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so writing this work has been really cathartic\nYou to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself\nBeing really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have ... on this side and\nYou know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve Bryn Mawr\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and being a woman in a context that was\nObviously just as sex us as the rest of the culture but in hip hop and there was definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself in that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods\nAnd you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I\nHave a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually does means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more\nSo individual ... went to the United nations schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material on during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said\nBut he called cracking good job a she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so\nYou know I really try to ... my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this I'll say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nWell I think like so many of us in today's culture I come from a mixed upbringing experience my family was black and white him on my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both\nAs my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intriguing and interfaith guilt [laughter] but you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like well what is it which is in Utah white you this that and\nYeah I heard a lot of that and gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that's Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure our pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called Code Switch it's all about race and identity and America and in our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U.S are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what you told us\nI spent the first of all the years of my life thinking that I was a little white girl and when I found out that it wasn't it wasn't just revelation it was late ... says\nSo really I think it's kind of a lack of identity that
