Istanbul\nThe Saturday acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin Salman they note that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day could show gee arrived at the consulate there are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body\nPresident Trump said he found the Saturday account of what happened credible he also said the fight an accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nFor a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and ten million of which is a military order for this is Vince and various

he's with the center for Strategic and International Studies he's written widely and consulted with both the state department and the defense department and he's with us now from Washington D.

California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times Mr Coby later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss can be so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these\nBecause I'm black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed him and I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to Robin someone you wouldn't you describe those things you might not so for\nExample you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nMhm [noise] it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate\nYes that's absolutely accurate\nDo you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to support the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police\nTo to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAnd I think here you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with it\nPolicy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly the mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected issued a mental health in certain areas and connected it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who um shouted by the root causes and story they needed to be told\nThat's about a Kobe she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county a sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nWe said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she must took it for her home and of course amplifying this is that the officer is white and a deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone\nAt Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police a traffic stops lead\nWhite on\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we're having over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that ended up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement traffic stops and I guess for land do cats do is kind of the tip of iceberg for me\nIt's still end up kind of steel he's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to\nAt least if I had a baby right traditions of citizens and police officers have what's lost here is that people are thinking the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus on the video\nIs really a kind of sets the stage for additional course content for both the citizen and also pollution police academies\nWhat will be expected of that police officers at the academy what\nWe've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that ... of course is a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it is to sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to text to what appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of it\nPrimer we need to go back and mix mix it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations of police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and pick at who was cast in yoga for head I can't\nI Can't forgive me why is that irrelevant when they issued that used to spark your concern here is an African American man in an encounter with a person that looked like him if that's the source of the Simpson why would you let let ...\nLet me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that uh do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could establish behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens\nKnow what their rights or I thought put it in schools and making the mandatory\nWas a great place to put it also also driver's license courses and also the police department of police academy and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nWell but the question I think some people might have is the question the conduct of the drivers or is the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nI think it's a combination of both how do we make certain that there is\nContent that deals with that biased piece how do we make certain that and police departments that they have psychological examinations that Fred out that unconscious bias or an instance is try to erase as best possible the buys ...

Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society is role and doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges in exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and science something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us and it's good to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve in something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for in a minute quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the heritage\nBut like the the ethical concern here is what do you get to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties or to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat is a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo they're all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um the Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they've been particularly intentional at this um creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's an extent in a program that's been very successful as you say in cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench and heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy worth the fancy law school\nOverwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges\nAnd to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine but also to make the make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not find\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey have been very close melts about it I tried them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their materials said a generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who the donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating ...\nWhich suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible years that's Adam attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us\nIt was great to be her finally today we're going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in the ... or ... shows\nAnd let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day I cannot stop thinking about it but for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premiere episode of the Roseanne ... this week that you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular Ninety show after its star Roseanne Barr\nDecided to try a spin off called the Connors which mere this week and we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character died by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nNot possible we knew she had a problem she was only a pain pills for two days after surgery was just I'd be pro Scott to be wrong\nWe want us to talk about so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opioid opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via

Journal online Jeff welcome back to you as well always welcome to be back and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough\nSocial commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you see it you know it's\nReally interesting because anytime a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and\nA looming in a lot of ways in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide the inside right and it was for her case one of the things that was really strange to me is that\nOne of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of\nRacist tweet that got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that\nThat you know medication and essentially led to this behavioral change so there was a weird tension in some ways uh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior Medicaid or not in the\nSo is our culture guide though what did you think of the episode just as briefly as yeah I Know it was\nIn a really good job of a touching on the
