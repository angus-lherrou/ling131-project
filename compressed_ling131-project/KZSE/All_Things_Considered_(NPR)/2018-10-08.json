which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have the trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has this country than she did still want you to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd that's what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day and [laughter]

considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure or is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images the when the elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of\nThan it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as real as I'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes\nLike that happen yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany many images of a particular person and an accurate labels and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there are just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this\nUm is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by society\nIt works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are Alice O'Toole is head of the face perception

rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and\nYou feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch the national attention which they did they were a front page news there were\nSongs and you know musical numbers about them everyone is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food is just a lot of bad stuff in their food and so there's this in media push back\nRight to in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights that spans decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde on arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\nYes once this first food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his famous poisons glad experiments once that law\nThe elder Hi Glenn outsell a silk acid went out bore acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compound is this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk\nBut it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story or something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story of a single person who changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused

Minnesota Public radio news then another question now from our friends should brains on that's her science\nBroadcast for kids and curious adults how do we know the facts to understand how well\nBrings on his looking up the process of science and how it works and how scientists use evidence to help us understand ourselves in the world around us\nWho's volley blooming twelve year old co host Kate ready have more\nNo one magic way to do science but its core science is this\nBuild around and people are doing this long before we called the science and we call these people philosophers are naturalist or doctors but anyway you slice it it was still science that rigorous examination of the world what counts as\nRigorous changes all the time\nThat's Alex ... she's a science historian at Mississippi State university but even though the exact\nMethods used to have changed science has some basic characteristics\nDares repetition someone's doing the same experiment every single day for three years or they go around the world following different eclipse is in order to make observations of a cold so\nIt has to be replicable meaning that if a scientist find something in an experiment other scientists should be able to recreate it and find the same thing\nThere's also these qualities of the scientists that makes them rigorous or they're disinterested in their objective these kinds of qualities that allows them to think beyond themselves\nScience is also about precision the Seventeen hundreds tools like they're monitors scales and other instruments of measurements we're becoming more exact inconsistent and they've just gotten better and better ever since okay so science is about objectivity\nPrecision repetition and curiosity but it's also about creativity being able to think about things differently so let me talk about William Harvey than\nMe really little me you know what's there to say he was a British scientists working in the sixteen hundreds so four hundred years ago and he wanted to learn about how our bodies work like what's the deal with blood back then people thought that blood came from the liver\nAnd I'm just kind of like slashed around the body until it reached the part where it needed to be and would be absorbed\nBut William Harvey was a very curious and he noticed that this idea of our blood came from\nWell yeah this guy named Galen came up with it like a thousand years before I was even born are we really okay just being like yeah sure Galen blood just flashes around\nWell I'm not so one experiment he does involves a man's arm and a piece of fabric so get this I tie the fabric tightly above the guy's elbow and the band pops out blood was stuck there and couldn't get out it was obvious that could only flow in one direction\nAnd this did not gel with what everyone else is thinking about the way blood worked\nIf it's soft all around the body it wouldn't be stuck in one spot like that and then there was the snake\nYou cut a snake open and pitch the blood off above the snake hurt 'em so the snake is still alive hurt is still bleeding but it's still flowing and the heart starts to shrink and\nStart to get pale\nAnd um it becomes clear to him that this is this is because it's empty right so he's pinched on these um the vein about the heart in it it's meant that the heart can't fill up with blood\nAnd so it starts to look like a dead bird like starts to really slow down and struggle and so then he lets go to the blood in it and it does apart again hurts me engaged and happy\nAnd then he inches off the air to and the heart becomes filled with blood and doing this he he claims that he has demonstrated that the heart pump the blood and it circulates\nThrough the body boom major discovery right there that gay Lynn that fundamentally change the way people thought about bodies right thought about their own body and I thought about the heart\nOf hearts and it becomes quite a bit more important\nAnd this is based on these very careful on set of experiments and\nHistorian of science alec ... talking about how science works for more on the history of to fact finding powerhouses science in

right now mostly lights a moderate Tom and mostly across the northern half of Minnesota ranges from drizzle the light rain to moderate range temperatures mainly in the forties Twin Cities were getting

Chang\nPresident Trump hosts the swearing in ceremony tonight at the White House where the newest justice on the Supreme Court\nBrett Kavanaugh will be on the bench tomorrow when the Supreme Court holds oral arguments he was confirmed over the weekend on a narrow party line vote and today the president told a group of law enforcement officers in Florida that Kavanaugh's rise to the high court\nGives Republicans a political boost\nAll over the country of rallies and people are loving that man and loving that yours\nWill have more on how the political battle over canonize affecting the mid term elections in a bit but first let's go to NPR's Scott Horsley Hey Scott I also see a picture of how Kavanaugh's presence on the court will will shift the decisions will see over the next few decades potentially\nWill certainly shift according to the right remember he was chosen from a list of judicial candidates drawn up by the federalist society and the Heritage Foundation a list of reliable conservatives and that's something you couldn't always say about the justice she'll be replacing Anthony Kennedy\nKennedy of course was a Reagan appointee and generally conservative but he occasionally did side with the liberal wing of the court most famously on us\nReaffirming the right to abortion\nKavanaugh is expected to be much more conservative than Kennedy and that leaves chief justice John Roberts now as the pivot point on the court to that's right [laughter] it'll be up to robbers to decide how much judicial restraint to exercise and then that will determine whether this\nShift is a gradual series of rightward steps or one big leap\nGave some very bitter confirmation fight we saw in the last several weeks has damaged the course reputation as a political body it\nIt certainly has the possibility to do that now we're going to have five conservative justices all appointed by Republican presidents four liberal justices all appointed by Democrats and\nTo the extent their decisions divvy up along those partisan lines the court runs the risk of being seen as just another political branch of government snapped by partisans in robes rather than a an impartial body that somehow above politics\nAnd it certainly doesn't help the Kavanaugh is confirmed by that extremely narrow vote with just one Republican one Democrat breaking ranks and the Senate\nAlso listen to how President Trump described the campaign against Kevin out today was a disgraceful situation\nBrought about by people that are evils and he just didn't we'll tufted out together and I have to think the\nRepublican senators that fought so hard for this because it was an easy so you have the president they're talking about this in very part is in terms of his press secretary Sarah Sanders

considerable attention from climate change activists three people are on trial for trying to shut down an oil pipeline to call attention to climate change\nSo high profile case because the defense is allowed to argue that the dangers of climate change justified breaking the law\nVoters in Clearwater county voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump who has called climate change a hoax or Dan Crocker is covering the trial for us and he joins us now from Begley good afternoon Dan it down so when they pick potential jurors here where they asked about their views on climate change they\nWere um during jury selection that defense attorneys ask prospective jurors what their beliefs were on climate change and they were all over the map so some people just flat out said they didn't believe in it one person called it a farce\nAnother person question you know how scientists can predict what the climate is going to be like fifty to a hundred years from now and we have trouble sometimes predicting what the weather's going to be tomorrow\nSome said they thought the climate was changing but they weren't so that how much the burning of fossil fuels is to blame for that and then some strongly did believe\nFarmer said he doesn't understand how people can trust their doctors but not trust what Ninety seven percent of scientists say an overall though I'd say a majority of the pool of thirty prospective jurors either didn't believe in the science behind human caused climate change or they were pretty skeptical of it\nLiberal county is not just Trump country it's also oil pipeline country to a did that come up in jury selection\nYeah it really did so pipelines runs through here there's a big pipeline terminals north of bag Leah and there's a lot of people who worked worked for the pipeline jobs here\nAnd several potential jurors actually did have family members who worked for an bridge the pipeline company or they were well there are other folks who worked on pipelines several people actually told the judge did they did that they didn't think they could be fair they said they could not be impartial because of that connection\nThey said that you know working on pipelines can be dangerous and I thought that the actions that these activists took really in danger of their loved ones um I should point out that the defendants on when they did do their uh their action they did call image ahead of time so that they did have time to shut down the pipelines before they I'm committed their act of civil disobedience\nSo what's not a question here is whether the defendants tried to shut down the pipe line right because the method that\nRight but they're they're using a unique defense your town called the necessity defense and what they're arguing is that they're active civil disobedience was justified to try to stop what they see as the greater harm of climate change\nAnd that's why the defense attorney was really drilling down and the beliefs of the jurors had about climate change as well as about civil disobedience\nAnd interestingly I'm almost all the potential jurors twenty eight out of thirty by my count they said that they did not believe it was okay to violate the law for a moral beliefs\nIs there any precedent here uh concerning climate change protesters or have they been allowed to argue their actions are justified to prevent or would they would regard as a greater\nFew have but this is one of the fewer defendants are going to be able to make that case to a jury and not just to a judge it's also pretty unique in that and that this does involve some felony charges that could result in several years in prison so these are pretty serious charges\nUm but just last Wednesday time the judge said that expert witnesses who the defense was planning to call cannot testify specifically about climate change the judge said because he said it would confuse the jury\nAnd he said that the expert witnesses would not add up but not aid the jurors and making making their decision\nAnd that's thrown at a big wrench into defenses plans they've set it quote I'm evaporates their defense\nSo the defendants themselves can still make arguments about climate change um but ... and they're still planning on calling some of their well known expert witnesses including um journalist Bill McKibben\nFormer NASA scientist James Hansen it's still really unclear though what if anything those folks are actually going to be allowed to say about climate change when they're on the witness stand what's in store tomorrow\nSo the jury is going to get seated after the defense in the state both strike their witnesses then they're going to proceed with opening arguments and the trial could last until Thursday\nDan Crocker reporting for us from bag leaf thank you very much You're welcome\nNow to the un inter governmental panel on climate change that agency has released a new report the details just how much science as say we need to limit greenhouse gas emissions to avoid catastrophe\nIt's a high level report that looks at the global effects of climate change but what does it mean for us\nHere in Minnesota we put that question to our lives with Dunbar who covers climate change for NPR News she's here to walk us through this report with some Minnesota context specifically Elizabeth good afternoon afternoon Tom so what's the quick overview here the headline what does the un reports say it's\nLot of things we already now so we've already seen global\nOnly two degrees Fahrenheit it doesn't sound like a lot but this report shows that the impact\nThat global warming has had on both people and ecosystems that's deadly heat waves extreme rainfall sea level rise all of those changes the report suggests will affect lots of things but especially where and how we're able to grow food and sustain ourselves\nSo given all of that when it comes to what we've seen in Minnesota so far what a scientist a tribute ing to climate change\nThe most significant change we've seen here in Minnesota is warmer winters which can affect everything from ice on our legs the snow season for winter recreation the types of animals trees and insects that are thriving the other major change we've already seen here in Minnesota is that it sweater\nAnd at that and more of our participation comes down in the form of heavy rain so there's a whole range of effect so in the city it means more flooding problems with infrastructure in the country it can really hurt farmers heavy rain can erode the soil that they're using to grow crops\nAnd it can make it really hard to do their field work so this week it's a great example of that a lot of farmers would normally be harvesting corn and soybeans but there are some places where they can't even get a tractor and the field because it's so wet and even if they are able to get in and get the crops out the green is going to have to be dried out and that involves extra expense\nWhat makes the headlines when it comes to global climate change um extreme weather such as hurricanes and certainly last year and and to some degree Florence and people dying and heat waves as well where does Minnesota fit into the picture\nQuestions so if we're looking at the observed data Minnesota so far has not seen increased heat waves in the summer ah but if we look at the climate models here's what we can say about Minnesota we are likely to get even warmer\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

R. go dot com\nWe're going to have to reduce emissions significantly to limit to global warming and they're talking about what one degree Fahrenheit ... that we should use it as one of the right globally right one and a half was it in half his right yeah oh I'm Sorry Celsius you're exactly right so how is Minnesota doing on that\nWell Minnesota's definitely doing better than some other states and countries on reducing emissions but we're definitely not on track to reduce the emissions by the magnitude set out in this latest report\nSo the easiest way to think about this is by looking at okay where do our greenhouse gas emissions come from in the first place traditionally that's been for producing electricity coal fired power plants\nNow are being retired so Minnesota does have these two nuclear plants that are producing carbon free electricity we're on track in there but we're going to have to speed up\nThe adoption of wind solar and battery storage if we want to meet the emissions targets and that and if we stop burning burning fossil fuels electricity by the middle of the century\nYou know we're also have to going to face the emissions from transportation and

persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat in a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house\nShe also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly in an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore [laughter] really a surprise tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last few years there has kind of ban it steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political and its\nAs and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posed with really lengthy almost like scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming midterms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people that are really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of his movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so
