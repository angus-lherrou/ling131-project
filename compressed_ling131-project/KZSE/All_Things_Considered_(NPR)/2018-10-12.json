Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida oyster industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today\nWell you know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they'd fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe so when we drove into day my producer Becky solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the\nTrees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees were stood at a here in ...\nIn ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled under wash them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched it out\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now just single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in ... no power no ... very limited cell service and no outside help yeah\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the hardest waster industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and ... they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... along the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf but also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi whole they call it keep it out of harm's way\nBut some of the seafood restaurants and and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage and working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\nSources is true which is that eight essentially is a hit squad Fifteen people was waiting for him in in the conflict\nOn it is just impossible to imagine that some kind of that an operation like that would not have happened without the knowledge and approval of the very top levels of of the Saudi\nGovernment can when President Trump was asked about 'cause she'll be in the oval office yesterday about an arms deal with the Saudis and this is how he answered\nWe don't like it John we'd all like we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to me\nHe didn't let me turn to you let me turn this should the u._s. be selling arms to Saudi Arabia right now\nGive the president credit for almost a usually when people sell their sole they tried to deny that there certainly is a pretty honest that were selling a or democratic principles were selling human rights were selling us residents life\nDown to two for for money or even stipulate at a price that and so it it it's sort of working to was like the access of greed and we'll of Saudis are part of it uh and the second thing that seems clear here is that we have spent the last couple of years\nSucking up to the Saudis and you would think if that would have a good effect on Saudi foreign policy you think they wouldn't do this sort of thing and so the idea of flattering people to get them to do your thing flattering really dictatorial regimes that does not seem to work so I'd say it's a low\nRight that David Brooks in the

that are millions of years old\nThe science museum of Minnesota has a new curator of paleontology Alex Hastings says just started in the job he's done research where his PHD in fossil crocodiles and helped discovered the world's largest snake the extinct\nTied to know boa and he joins me now with more on what else is new with the world's oldest things it's good to have you here I thanks so what is it about the collection of the holdings here only some of which are on display at the science museum of Minnesota the Druze here\nI'm so not only does the museum had a great collection of ah dinosaurs which are always the the icon for paleontology\nUm but it also has a very large collection of fossil crocodiles and as you were saying I I did a a huge part of my career has been based on um the evolution of the kinds of crazy different things that crocodiles have done over the millions and millions of years that they've been around\nAnd there was a really really grates a collection\nA from a very important part of crocodile evolution or right here in St Paul\nSo how do you bring specimens fossils or big you know a a kind of uh the big impressive dinosaurs how do you bring them to life for people who come to the museum today\nA lot of it is talking about how these are\nReal are or were real living breathing animals\nAre massive creatures that had to do all the things that we're familiar with doing today so I had to eat sided deal with temperature and water and\nAlways talking about them in a very kind of lively way I'm also I I tend to have a a fair bit of enthusiasm for them because I Love them so much\nSo having your own energy when you're talking about these can also kind of help a transfer that enthusiasm to other people\nYou love them and you say paleontology is your life's passion and I'm Wondering why the fascination tell us and and and more about how it began for you\nUm I was like most three year old said just absolutely love dinosaurs and the only difference is I I still haven't grown up\nI find the ancient world immensely fascinating and thinking about how these creatures that are unlike anything that we have today for once running around um in some of the same places that were we have cities in cars today\nI'm so it's a a familiar world in one way but it completely strange in different world than another way\nYou see your interest as being a ... year researchers has been crocodiles when you've discovered that big snake uh but I'm Wondering are they\nAre your favorite should have a favorite dinosaur one that has a fascination where you\nUh I Do but if one's a one that uh folks might have to Google it's called ... um and that is my favorite dinosaur because it has these ridiculously long claws that's about a three foot long claws\nOn this um two legged dinosaur this kind of a relative of of raptors in in a I'm a ... way\nUm but just having those kind of big bizarre huge hands are disproportionately large their body um yet there are before it's they're using this primarily as defense in a way of kind of bringing leaves in trees or or at least from trees down to them and they're just totally weird and bizarre and um they're they're definitely my favorite\nStill left to discover what ... what what do we know we don't know uh in terms of how\nThey're actually looking at is just ate the tiniest of fractions what used to be alive\nUm so what we're getting is just that tiny little idea of what their houses like so\nWhen we were talking about the you know there's hundreds of species of dinosaur have been described so far that's probably\nLess than one percent of what actually used to live here on earth you're talking about over a hundred million years of time just today we have millions and millions of species of animals so going back in time we expect to apply that millions of times across all those years of the age of the dinosaur so I guarantee\nWe'll continue to find new dinosaurs for many many many many many years to come\nAlix Hastings is the new fitzpatrick chair of paleontology at the science museum of Minnesota thanks for coming in and telling us about your work and good luck thank you and to more you can meet Alex at fossil day at the museum from ten thirty to four in downtown St Paul\nAll things considered on Minnesota Public radio news was fun to talk to Alex about things

be a rubber stamp for a liberal agenda\nI'm an independent voice that's not beholden to any party leader or any corporate special interests I'm willing to work with the president when it benefits

industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble um someone already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as it were there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged it in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched the\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now and just a single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors and Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in ... no power no very limited cell service and no outside help you\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the hardest oyster industry they've got fishing going on there are a lot of fishing and ... they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nBut they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most boats escape major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage are working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing that it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe comes right it could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power ceases as worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding that Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today you're well\nOr districts are using across the country as they make their bed to win more seats in the U.S house of representatives\nCNN ... race is one of the most expensive in contested competitions in the country because it's an open seat that you follow her Tim Walz who's running for governor barely won a few years ago when the district voted decidedly for Trump\nMost of the debate focused on how national issues are playing out in southern Minnesota for instance fan pointed out that had it on supported Trump's trade disputes with China Canada and Mexico which resulted in terrorists that have hit southern Minnesota soybean corn and hog farmers hard\nHad it on said he generally doesn't support terrorists but he supports Trump using them as a way to negotiate better deals for the U.S in the long run he pointed to a new trade deals with Canada and Mexico as an example\nWe're already reset with Mexico and Canada that's good support with the president did\nThere on health care that you candidates diverge sharply how your door and said he supports Trump's efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare which he said it's bad for hospitals like Mayo Clinic\nSeems that he'd prefer to let people buy into Medicare and policy have your door and said would be bad for providers like mail which already struggles with low Medicare reimbursement rates and the two squabble over immigration as well have your door and said the country needs a wall on the border for security reasons\nWe need a wall in advancing we need every kind of security border we can so that ill illegal folks drugs everybody else don't come over don't come into the United states was to come here through legal process\nThe instead immigrants aren't the threat he said cyber attacks by other countries are bigger concern\nIf our entire focus is spent on the idea of the wall we're going to miss things that are bigger threat to his country along the way\nAnd said he supports reform at the immigration system because businesses and farmers and the district need workers and he supports a path\nBut some of the most heated discussion came when that you talked about their previous experience both candidates accused each other of being outsiders and to some degree both are\nBeing lived in red wing which was part of the first district at the time but he moved out of state when he was fourteen from there he served in Iraq taught in schools and worked for president Brock Obama in Washington DC before moving to man Kato and twenty Seventeen\nHad joined accused of being a being a Democratic Party plant\nYou were sent out here by the resistance Pelosi and company to try to take power in this district\nThat how you doing spent much of his life in Washington to his father held the seat and I are going to high school and college in Virginia happy during worked in Congress and under previous administrations being painted ... as a Washington insider who follows the party line\nWashington is full of demographers that's why it is broken right now\nBut whether each candidates Minnesota ... will be a game changer for voters in this tight race is anyone's guess according to most pollsters the district is a true toss up just weeks from election day cancer and Richard Minnesota Public radio news he\nTrue

story is a tale of scanned\nReally really good wine let me introduce you to the court of master ... as you may know are the people who help you pick wine in a restaurant\nThe criminal the criminal ... says we're taking a test to become master ... only two hundred Seventy four people have ever passed this year twenty four did\nBut this is where our story takes a scandal is turn and I'm going to let Karen McNeil pick it up here she is author of the wind Bible guidelines that many ... study that was part of their training carrying McNeil welcome thank you Mary Louise\nSo there are several parts to the master ... diploma exam we're focused on the eastern portion tell me what happened with the twenty Eighteen exam\nYes well it was struggling as you can imagine here were candidates who took the tasting part only to discover to be told a few days later that the test had been invalidated\nAnd why hadn't been invalidated well it appears that one of the people grading the exam\nHad passed some kind of information to one of the test takers that would've allowed that test taker an unfair advantage\nHe slipped an answer or she slipped in answer is that what you're saying yes exactly described the test I mean what do you have to do to pass\nIt is so hard and so you're in a room with the other candidates your porridge six winds the winds could be from anywhere in the world and you have to name what that wine is\nThe great variety or varieties it's made from and the vintage you're blindfolded to entice you can't even see it right absolutely you are doing this entirely blind\nCan't they just take it again you said it's a half hour test that could just take it again and presumably patch\nThat's where the ...\nActual let's say typical PHD if you if you were taking a test in physics right you study all the material now you know the material that would be a hassle to take the test again up but you couldn't do it\nAnd then ... them is much more like being in a certain sense of professional athletes\nPart of your body has to be on that day\nAh and some days you have a good performance and sometimes you don't yes\nSo while undoubtedly all of these candidates really do know their stuff they're going to have to once again perform in the way an athlete in the Olympics might\nAnd the distinction between a master ... who has passed this test and become certified you make more money you you have access to a different jobs than you would have otherwise so Iraq\nYes and significantly more money I'm someone who has studied and is working as a ... on the floor of a restaurant but without a credential that person's going to make about fifty five thousand dollars a year on average a master's so now you may can make three times that\nWithout sounding flip I can think of worse exams to have to take twice than sitting and drinking some of the world's finest why\n[laughter] well you're not drinking them you're tasting them and says that it'll come out when you tell people that you for a living you have to taste four thousand whines a year\nThey're they're not exactly drowning in tears for your young\nBut I think of all the times you've tasted a great wine and if someone asked you to write an essay on it\nWon't tell you the vintage here of course\nIt's actually quite hard to do and you know when you do get that certification the master ... certification you have every right to feel enormously proud\nThat is Karen McNeil author of the wine Bible thanks so much for talking to us pleasure all things considered from Minnesota Public radio\nProgramming is

so what is it about the collection of the holdings here only some of which are on display at the science museum of Minnesota the Druze here\nI'm so not only does the museum had a great collection of ah dinosaurs which are always the icon for paleontology\nUm but it also has a very large collection of fossil crocodiles and as you were saying I I did a ... a huge part of my career has been based on um the evolution of the kinds of crazy different things that crocodiles have done over the millions and millions of years that they've been around\nAnd there was a really really grates a collection a from a very important part of crocodile evolution or right here in St Paul\nSo how do you bring specimens fossils or big you know a a kind of uh the big impressive dinosaurs how do you bring them to life for people who come to the museum today\nA lot of it is talking about how these are\nReal or were real living breathing animals\nAre massive creatures that had to do all the things that we're familiar with doing today so I had to eat sided deal with temperature and water and all those other needs and I'm always talking about them in a very kind of\nLively way I'm also I I tend to have a a fair bit of enthusiasm for them because I Love them so much um so having your own energy when you're talking about these can also kind of help a transfer that enthusiasm to other people\nYou love them and you say paleontology is your life's passion and I'm Wondering\nUs and and and more about how it began for you\nUm I was like most three year old said just absolutely love dinosaurs and the only difference is I I still haven't grown up\nI find the ancient world immensely fascinating and thinking about how these creatures that are unlike anything that we have today for once running around um in some of the same places that were we have cities in cars today\nI'm so it's a a familiar world in one way but it completely strange in different world than another way\nYou see your interest as being a ... year researchers has been crocodiles when you've discovered that big snake uh but I'm Wondering are they are your favorite you do have a favorite dinosaur one that has a fascination where you\nUh I Do but if one's a one that uh folks might have to Google it's called ... um and that is my favorite dinosaur because it has these ridiculously long claws that's about a three foot long claws\nOn this um two legged dinosaur this kind of a relative of of raptors and in a um a off side way", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Rochester", "day": "12"}
