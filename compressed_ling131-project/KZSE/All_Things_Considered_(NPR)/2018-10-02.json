like to see some foreign do this and the ad gone national attention I later I had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic

it\nRight it was just hours ago it candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nThat he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record

first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temps in seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I ask Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility was just under lemon dollar range of over Fifteen dollars\nThis was all ready far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest men in the world CEO Jeff ... of [noise]\nTwo\nWeeks ago a group demonstrated outside of base of speech and Washington protesting the wide gap\nHis

dollar minimum wage ... said the company listened to its critics one of the most high profile ones has been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nFor her to give credit where credit's due in letters or being able to derive\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurants\nHe has introduced a bill called the ...

thought it was great news and see how could be other than good news is the\nAuthor is an economist at MIT and he says there are several ways to view Amazon's move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages anyway Italy marketers tightening uh so it just you know decided to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economy\nDo tend to spend extra earnings and there's a kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste today it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage however Amazon's Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to Bush for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number of rough relieving for me\nBut Senator Sanders says he hopes the ... stamp of approval convinces the rest of the

house\nIt's officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct\nThe third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dementia and\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this crime or things of that the state to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the result of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehend\nToilet in itself for his use but he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate sun himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet [noise]\nThe problem in this case Stephen ... is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable\nThat executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's gets a frantic word delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder after the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer would this murder and at some point in time to stay looks forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial judge Lee was appropriate in this case\nA decision and the case is expected later in the term Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington\nListening to all things considered from NPR News\nOne of the most common surgeries might become a bit less common that's our Tuesday topic with Dr John ...\n[noise]\nAn appendectomy most of us knows someone who's had one maybe you've had one a new study published in jama has shown that many people can get by with antibiotics rather than surgery and Dr John ... back to tell us more about how this may change the way doctors think about\nAppendectomy is welcome back John Hi Tom thanks versus the appendix what's why do we have one what is\nThe appendix is the name of it implies an appendage and sort of his finger like pouch right at the interface between where the small intestine ends and the large intestine begins\nIts purpose is not really clear we think it has you know some sort of um immune system quality to it it's a lovely voice issue with it it may be as some people call it a safe house for good bacteria but at the end of the day we're not really sure what purpose it serves and clearly we can live without it\nHands the appendectomy in that case when it gets inflamed appendicitis or what are those symptoms and how do you diagnose it\nYeah and so when people get in a sort of abdominal pain come in the middle of the guys but then as the hours go by it starts to move down toward the right lower side\nAnd people have a loss of appetite it hurts like crazy um you can get a fever it's hard to walk or extend your right leg um those are all kind of the symptoms of a pen decided us\nFor years we were the clinical diagnosis just based on what someone look like and what they're a dominant Sam was like and then we started doing ultrasounds and that would sort of tell us if the appendix is inflamed or a second and then more recently the standard of care is diagnosed with us each year a CAT scan it\nCan be really serious right would in cases where the ... may burst\nAs to the extent that it's not treated it burst you can get some income parrot tonight is which is an information or infection of the of the abdomen itself and uh I mean it can be life threatening and people have died in and could die from it if it's untreated\nHence the a historical impulse always to get it out to remove it right\nThat's right and so for years the idea's been that if you have a pen decided this is a surgical emergency in other words there's really no alternative you need to get it out and what is this new study pointing towards well this really kind of turns it on its head um researchers in Finland conducted at randomized clinical trials on gold standard trial began over five years ago\nAnd they took about five hundred people put them into two groups either you had your appendix taken out or you left it and then do the antibiotic therapy and they found that Seventy percent of people did not actually need to have the surgery\nHowever that was so game changing that they really wanted to continue this study for an additional five years really looking at people over time and at the end of the day they found that I'm about thirty nine percent of people who are treated with antibiotics eventually need to have their appendix out but the flipside of that is it's sixty percent of people did not\nSo that really is a game changer that most people probably do not need to have their antics taken out when it's an uncomplicated appendicitis case\nSo they're always will be cases where people should have their appendix out but not in every case\nExactly so I think that that's just me a surgical decision this is gonna be a call based on surgeons and medical teams in emergency rooms you know based on how someone looks based on their white count in their fever and how they look and what the CAT scan shows but a lot of people now will have an option\nAnd that option will be antibiotic therapy and you know it's typically a few days in the hospital ivy antibiotics and an oral antibiotics after that\nUm but you know gosh there's a place where there aren't you know surgeons readily available this is kind of a game changer you know this is you know rural places in this country I'm developing nations places where surgeons are not instantly accessible um this is good news\nDepartment of family medicine and community health at the

making it to eighty five and Seventy seven and a even getting to a brief playoff appearance\nAs you recall or they lost to the New York Yankees in last year's American League wildcard game at a news
