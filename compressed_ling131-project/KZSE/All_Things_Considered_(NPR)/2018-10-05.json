happening\nHe also testified that at some point look phonic Donald after he was on the ground tried to push himself up you also cannot feet back on the video when push on this point Jason Van Dyke

should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the road and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she ... she said questions there that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals now departed\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week was testifying\nThat that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him and his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what time is on I had by the way he acted like in our town\nWell clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if you did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interviewed well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople wing and then continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nForeign sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respecting the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he\nThe nation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things I shouldn't have said\nWhat things should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and the ... gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not faulted for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout

asking for a fossil fuel free economy out in the campaign trail and yet you've held hundreds of thousands of dollars in investments in coal and Halliburton and Exxon and energy stocks\nWilson argued that he works across the aisle and stood up to the Republican White House\nIf you're looking for someone who's collaborative who cooperates who compromises to get things done that's exactly what I've been doing as a member of Congress\nBut Philips accused Polson up overwhelmingly voting to support President Trump's policies\nNinety eight percent of the time with Donald Trump is truth as bad as the

high and the low fifties\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the judge and he should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals and are out of power who\nKnow him well say the justice that they\nLast week will testifying well that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what Thomas on I had\nBy the way he acted like an atomic time\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course\nInterview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers and said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right [laughter] they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice rally foreign\nShore I one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basing release based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... you know became president I don't hear too many people are questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut Tibet specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary\nTruly unconstitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things they shouldn't have said what things should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and the ... gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage
