let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and a legend scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either\nFirst what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWhat a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week and it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's offices you know it's usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purported plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this was a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR this individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct\nIt seems that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four the individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this looming\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down in individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nAt the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting gaining here\nTiming is indeed curious ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV\nAh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember or around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer in twenty sixteen uh a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually we're attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Miller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from other\nThe bottom line here in this whole regular regular moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you but you're\nEbola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo

physician over the years when I first read it when\nI was a senior in college in the images and the ideas have really stuck with me I think if my experience my my journey to becoming a physician and\nYou know my I start in the anatomy lab working with cadavers I'm assisting in surgery I'm I'm responding to codes when people's heart stopped beating him or using electricity ... back to

know renovation of of frogs legs with electrical stimulation and even executed prisoners applying this in public demonstrations and watching them set up or turn their head or a grim is\nJust imagine the impact on the young girl seeing and hearing all of these things\nSo while it was based on science it's regarded as the first science fiction novel but it also brings up issues of bio ethics too doesn't it\nSure does it mean Victor Frankenstein creates life at this very for me the if like you know story and yet when he has created it he is revolt by it in a band and that raises all these issues of like if we're going to tinker with science what are our responsibilities with thousands of people have\nPostulated that this new gets into cloning and genetic manipulation and you know our responsibility to patients mean all of that is sort of born in this and certainly you know all over the world this year people are having bioethics conferences and supposedly ah using the novel is

extraordinary\nSo Frankenstein we think of it as a hard shell but there's a lot more than ... points the way to the future\nOh sure does it mean to think that this Eighteen year old girl sort of paved

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week to go before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic and his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with X. CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nFull interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this most constitutional scholar\nAnd they would argue actually that Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and that children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House his critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its

question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration and the this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nSo we brought in our Brian Banks to fill us in on today's developments there have been a few Hi Brian hello Tom so interested in much of the day you've spent poring over campaign finance reports let's start there one of those reports tell us broadly\nThese are the last full look that will get before the election and there are reports that cover fundraising and spending in state races so governor attorney general went down through the state house\nAnd boy is this a year for the record books and those contests alone more than forty four million dollars has been spent so far by candidates parties and outside groups\nDemocrats have generally put more into the most competitive races and there aren't often in the suburbs where the race for control of the Minnesota houses being waged the most expensive races and there are several into well into six figures already are in the suburbs and involve seats now held by Republicans\nKeep in mind that most Minnesota house candidates are limited to spending about sixty five to eighty five thousand dollars in spending on their own racist\nSo the parties and outside groups they're taking over\nThose are the legislative races let's look at the top of the ticket races the race for Minnesota governor what is the what are the numbers look like they're it's uh\nCredit how many Tim Walz is outraged Republican Jeff Johnson by about one point five million dollars to this campaign\nWalls also had more money in the bank for the final two weeks but democratic allies are also overwhelming their counterparts on the Republican side Jeff Johnson has been pounded by for a million dollars in ads on line and on TV from one group alone there's another nearly three million dollars from a separate pro walls group\nBy comparison the main Republican group on TV against walls suspend about one point seven five million dollars it's nothing to scoff at but still shy of the Democratic effort\nThe attorney general's race what are the numbers look like they're\nUnlike anything we've seen before both DFL or Keith Ellison and Republican Doug war do have raised a lot were outraged Alison in the last month but Ellison has more money saved up\nAnd the DFL party has invested one million dollars in this race and the first few weeks of October alone and eighty percent of that has been used to go after ward though was better position than any Republican in the last fifty years to win the job\nNow anyone is watch T. V. and seen the ads knows that Keith Ellison has a presence in races beyond his own uh tell us what's going on there and using him in ads against other Democrats\nThat's right has images in those commercials for and key races for Congress and the governor's race Republican and their allied groups are working to attach democratic candidates especially in the first and third district Alison they're trying to say that those candidates hold positions that mirror Allison's or they haven't done enough to condemn the Minneapolis congressmen for alleged conduct or controversial comments\nThey think of Ellison is struggling in a statewide race that he'll way down some of those other candidates in those races to\nKnow up in Minnesota's eighth district competitive won a court ruling today involving the Republican nominee Pete Stauber and he is St Louis county emails tell us more about that\nBack in March a reporter at the start to learn that the ... emails between the national Republican group in ... through his St Louis county\nThey refused to release them so that if a party went to court and a judge ruled today that the emails are public documents and what's in them well there had been plenty of buildup of what might be in these files\nThey were released this afternoon and show that strawberry was communicating in two thousand Seventeen with national Republican political staff about interviews\nSetting up congressional meetings offering assessments of the race and their views toward DFL incumbent Rick Nolan and email conversations were mostly briefing as we know by now noon didn't run again anyway but Democrats including rival Joe intervention his campaign say starve or used a taxpayer funded resource\nTo advance his political agenda\nAnd deserves to be held accountable by voters\nQuite an update touching on a lot of the week before election day from our Brian ... thanks You're welcome to them as we've\nBeen saying we are a week out from election day it's likely to be one of the most significant mid term elections we've had so NPR News digital editor Michael Olson joins me now to let us know about a voter guide to help you make an informed decision in this election Michael\nHello Tom so this voter guide how was it different from any other that voters might be coming across as we get them in the mail we see them in local papers\nYeah exactly a lot of the a lot of the guide showing up in your mailbox and a papers on social media a lot of those guys are coming from partisan sources uh or sources that are trying to push for a particular outcome [noise]\nUh this guy is a reflection of all of the reporting and debates that you've heard right here on NPR News so or or else scene on our website as well throughout the campaign\nThose this guide tell us where the candidates stand on different issues\nExactly it's it's all about it's all issue based so whether it's a you know all of the key state wide races um you know so we have governor all the Senate races are the key statewide races\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from the ... H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology in healthcare learn more at E. H. R. go dot com yeah\nThis is really exciting so this voter guide is available in the top four languages spoken in Minnesota so that's English Spanish among in Somali\nAnd uh we we realize that you know where where public media organization we need to serve the public and according to the census data on this ah of those languages that I pointed out there are about a hundred thousand Minnesotans that would that speak that language that don't speak English very well\nBut also on line an oldie but a goody are staple a and that is\nThe selecting candidates quiz you can take in effect right tell us about it absolutely it's one of my favorite political discovery tools out there we've built a quiz for every key race in the state\nThe quiz only shows you candidate positions or statements so there's no party affiliation or name so your outcome is based purely on your reaction to what you think is the most important stance so it's in it's a fun way I Would say to navigate the campaigns during a time when many voters are tired of the negativity and hyper partisanship\nMichael Olson thank you very much You're welcome\nIs NPR News digital editor now or you can check out those guides we were talking about an English Spanish among or Somali they're all at NPR News dot org slash election\nAnd um [noise] um [noise]\nAll things considered from Minnesota Public radio news good afternoon in the days since the fatal shooting of eleven worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue Jewish congregations and their supporters in the twin cities\nThe vigil was held at temple Israel in Minneapolis over the weekend that another at Mt Zion temple in St Paul last night\nOn NPR News earlier today rabbi Marcia Zimmerman of temple Israel said it's been powerful to see people of many faiths supporting the Jewish community as they grieve the deaths in Pittsburgh Zimmerman said faith leaders in Minnesota have been building connections between Jews Christians Muslims and others for Thirty years\nThere are in the new differences that being a Jew being them of being a Christian of being a Buddhist and it we are enriched by those many different narratives so it's not this desire to make everybody the same\nIn the current political climate Zimmerman said can feel like basic democratic rights and traditions are under attack but she said mutual support is the antidote to fear and violence\nThan so proud I Am so proud as an American to say that we have the transfer of power peacefully\nAnd it deals like that time is ending that we are regret saying to violence leading up to the elections\nViolence stopping people from voting and so the idea that we all have one vote and we all have the ability to make the choices of who represents dies\nIf that becomes to separate and all morals and ethics become separate\nIt's run by Marcia Zimmerman of temple Israeli Minneapolis speaking earlier today on NPR News the first funerals for the victims of the attack on worshippers at tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh took place today [noise]\n\n\nTuesday afternoons all things considered we continue here\nOn NPR News\nThe story the Santa and the Iranians I made possible by member investigation checking for forty not breaking numbers our every story and every step of the way I\nForecast where the twin cities tonight calling for mostly clear skies a low around thirty five degrees like westerly wins expected\nMostly sunny tomorrow with a higher around fifty two on Wednesday and then on the bed full for Halloween Night just partly cloudy skies but you had to Thursday mostly sunny with a high back in the low fifties and friday upper forties with a chance for some maybe morning rain showers\nTo talk more about how gab has created a space for white supremacists and other extremist views we turn now to Joan Donovan she studies media manipulation at data and society of research Institute in New York City welcome thank you for having me\nYou're somebody who's been monitoring gap for a while now before it was taken down how many people and gab react to the synagogue shooting\nThere was a range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut imagine other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do\nViolent acts in public as a way to get media attention can you describe\nWhite supremacist views yes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen Andrew ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning mega coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks after\nThe election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour bus again went on a media spree asking\nFor users and explicitly tied this then to the white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with Twitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms\nThat you wouldn't suffer the same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements I Want to\nPlay a piece of tape for you or NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gab CEO Andrew tour but about ... hours post when he said specifically the words I'm going and\nWould you expect us to do it like that you want us to censor anybody that's a phrase armed going in that what you're proposing hair and here's the thing he answered the bad or a beach or you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this referral\nI disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with troll cereal harasser\nOut not many people go on line to\nDefend against these kinds of post that get served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is heinous\nGab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment companies app stores they've all cut ties with gap and yet gab in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend\nHow likely is that well I Can't tell you exactly\nHow likely it is that there'll be able to replace their servers their domain their payment servicing and use the features that they are accustomed to serving\nTo their audience but what we do know is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure are backing out of these partnerships and I don't know if they're going to find companies that are willing to take the risk to their reputation to be known as\nSupporters of gap\nJoan ... is with data and society a research Institute in New York City thanks very much thank you [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIn North Dakota activists are scrambling to make sure Native Americans can vote next week they are a key block for Democrats but a recent U.S Supreme court ruling upheld the Republican legislatures changes to voter id requirements North Dakota voters now need street addresses and many Native Americans don't have them NPR's Jeff Brady reports\nThe northern edge of the Standing Rock reservation that ten prairie stretches for miles and it's so remote you have to go to the nearest to to get a cell phone\nI'm Nicole ... blocks from one modest what House to the next talking to his many of the one hundred fifty residents so she can\n... grew up on the reservation and now works for groups that encourage Native Americans to vote armed with a clipboard bright pink information sheets and buttons that read I'm indigenous and I vote she starts each conversation this way and we are\nGoing door to door and he finds night to make sure that um everybody knows about the new voting firemen\nHey yeah knocking on the radio on ... where he's new identification requirements will keep Native Americans from voting\nEspecially from the homeless people just because they don't have a home you know they're out on the streets small doesn't mean that we don't have the right to vote\nCallous lake confirms her id has a street address on it that's important because in one previous election North Dakota residents were allowed to vote using just PO box\nA federal appeals court overturned that and the U.S Supreme Court recently let that decision stand but requiring a street address is a problem for some Native Americans says Mike faith chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe\nSome of them don't even know there really are just as a post office box in Fort gates or chemical and go to that area\nIn the past it was easier to get around the home address requirement a poll worker could vouch for a voter or someone with no id could sign an affidavit that they were eligible to cast a ballot but Republicans who control the state government eliminated those provisions in recent years arguing they undermine the integrity of elections\nNorth Dakota's Republican secretary of state out Jagger says the affidavits became a problem when officials tried to verify them after the twenty sixteen election\nOver thirty six hundred voters we couldn't match those affidavits with a name on behalf of David ... an average\nJagger says I Can't say for sure that's\nA state with close races back in twenty twelve democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp won by fewer than three thousand votes and she faces a tough re election this year jaguar says allegations that Republicans changed id requirements to suppress democratic votes are false\nWhen who's been done is that the voters come to the polls have for sure and says that the other people are legitimate voters\nStanding Rock chairman my faith doesn't buy that argument but he says even if discouraging Native American voters was the goal it won't work\nInstead of keeping people away from the polls I think what they do is to encourage us to get to the schools\n[noise]\nAnd they already stopped\nOrganizers say they'll continue to knock on doors here at Standing Rock and at other reservations around the state hoping that by election day everyone will know that to vote they'll need\nId with their street
