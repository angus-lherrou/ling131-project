we're going to find out if that's true in a minute but first Katie you are no stranger to fax because you read a lot of news right yeah I Love to read the news how does reading the news most days change how you see the world\nI think it's sort of taught me to see the world look critically and carefully and now I just don't accept information as easily without looking at it\nWell that's a curious claim about ladybugs spots is it totally right or more like yeah right tell us find out we've called in a professional\nLinda cue as a journalist and our job is to check facts she looks at the New York times high high so Linda what exactly does affect you could do so my job is\nBasically to look at claims being made by politicians public officials or just anything in the news and see if it's true or not\nHow do you check a fact what kind of shows do you use that's a good question\nUm so I guess I rely on primary and secondary sources\nSo a primary sources someone was direct knowledge of the topic so for example if I'm gonna check a fact about ladybugs I'll talk to someone who studies ladybugs secondary source of something that all read so for example um I might read a newspaper article about a study on ladybugs that that would be a secondary source\nSo is it true that you can tell a lady bugs age limit spots\nIt's not a so this missed probably comes from the fact that there are many many species a lady bugs and\nI actually ask an expert about this who works at the Smithsonian Museum of natural history and he said that each species actually has a corresponding number of spots and there's about five thousand species all over the world some will have seven spots others have to and there's even one lady bugs fifteenth box it's from Asia\nAnd once a lady bugs becomes an adult it just never changes spots also lady bugs usually live for just a year or two at most so if they really did gain a spot every year all these lady bugs would only have one or two spots wow\nThat's amazing [laughter] do you have a favorite factor misinformation that you'd even during\nThe twenty sixteen Olympics do you know who you sample is yeah yeah so he's one of the fastest people in the world I he was talking about you know whether he would be scared are not going to Brazil to participate in the Olympics because there was a disease called ...\nOn and during the time he joked that he could he wasn't afraid because he could always out runs ... does so I thought check that and it turns out he can he's much faster than skills\nWhat happens if a bit of long information gets into the newspaper how do you fix it\nSo we issue what we call corrections um and and the print newspaper there's like a section\nThat says all the corrections of mistakes I made previously and on line it'll be at the bottom of the story I'm so for example if we said something happened in January but it actually happened in February the story will be updated too sick to include that air to say\nThe story will be updated to fix that Arab but also at the bottom we recognize that we made it a state and we're sorry about it so we always went up to our mistakes\nSo how did you get started in

government or or a business um you want to raise as much money as you possibly can and if you don't use all that money that donors are a little bit ticked off by that I'm also it gives you the excuse to raise more money than ...\nRepetition a ban do you think that works\nIt's a lot of what's being communicating these ads is a implicit it's not necessarily um the the direct messages that are being conveyed by repetition gets drilled into people\nWhen they're in the voting booth and I think that there is some evidence of that that sort of thing is effective overtime\nI Want to hear a couple of just parts of a couple and their their two very different examples of the negative ads the perennial negative ad and my right Ben that that most people said they don't like negative advertising and yet it must be effective right [noise]\nYeah absolutely everybody hates negative ads and and uh they do have some effect innocence are changing people's perceptions of the candidates\nAre the notion that attack ads work is a self fulfilling prophecy basically are there in every election one candidate has to win and that can and they'll say my advertising was affected\nAll right let's hear one and this one I Would say is a very a typical negative ads from the uh\nUm charges this sort of a exaggerated voiceover let's hear this this is from the congressional leadership fund and it's up against the eighth district congressional candidate a ... which\nOne to go to Washington can make live life running from the law\nAnd it goes on with claims and charges and that's a similar sound of it a very traditional negative ad how do you rate that in terms of ah affective ... just the tone in style of it bill\nWill they simplify it is such a degree that uh it is effective in terms of making the basic point whether it's true or not is the better question\nIt is it also a band that the negative ads are often not by the opponent but by an outside group allied with the usually but the\nThat is something we're seeing more and more of these outside groups are are a a larger and larger share of the overall advertising going on and and the actors do tend to be more likely to be running negative advertising rather than this\nCandidate is that a way for the Kennedy to to have a bit of deniability while I didn't run that ad I have no control over the outside groups\nThat's true it's actually illegal to coordinate in any way from most of these outside groups to do this it's obvious that it's going on I mean people are breaking the law when they're doing as a but the FCC really doesn't take any action and if they did\nTheir all populated by appointed Democrats and playing Republicans so they're not going to do anything that the party doesn't want them to do\nGood luck voters [laughter]\nThen there's the ad that's known as the big for the adage put out by the dean Phillips campaign I think largely it's\nBeing on social media and did sort of an interview with big foot\nOn I was gonna die [noise]\nAnd our pulse and comes along [noise]\nI mean you have tens of thousands of people looking for you all the time and not one of them are\nLike that is a bit of the big foot add that the dean Philips campaign has put up against their Paulson and a lot has been made about that bill what do you make of it\nUh it's a good at it in terms of getting attention and that's about where it stops right there on\n... plus and being hard to find and not being accountable to the voters which I don't even think they really close that circle I'm also in in Ninety seconds you never see the candidate you never see dean Philips um it it it just fails and on so many levels in that regard\nI Would say that this isn't a it's maybe one of the differences between an online ad in a television or the audience the presumed audience suspect for the side as it is a younger audiences ones that are on social media uh they're they're obviously using humor and here to reach people who made up\nThe news and um so it it may be that their objective here is a little different than your your typical television advertisements\nAre we at a tipping point now with TV ads versus digital is is the money still going into the to the thirty second TV ad or more and more for or on Facebook for example well you can move numbers\nAre with TV ads and you can move numbers in very short period of time um digital and social media works a lot differently you you need a lot more time a lot more adds a lot more targeting a tonight digital pay off in the same way as TV\n[laughter] yeah I Would say you see a lot of campaign still doing both of them I mean the the\nUh digital ads are very effective for reaching certain types of audiences for for reaching certain niche groups that may be a mass television audience is not what you're aiming for\nThey can also be really helpful for connecting voters directly to your um campaign website so they're they're much more connected to the the fundraising operation and the hope is that sort of the viral online ad um goes out there and then a lot of people come back to your side it's a little bit of a different thing than than a broadcasting on television what about\nAudience targeting especially on line given what we've heard about a Russian involvement and uh and fake ads ads that never mind that the Clintons maybe falls but the ads themselves maybe what are you hearing about\nThat Ben [noise] ah it's a really difficult thing to study um because so much of this goes on behind the scenes there I have some work for some colleagues who tried to sort of try to a reverse engineer the micro targeting that goes on but by getting a panel people to share the as if they're exposed to to try to figure out\nWhat people are actually being exposed online interesting reverse engineering that bill\nUm it used to be that a TV stations\nThey were members of the community and they felt like anything that they put it in the paper or put on the air reflected their own credibility we don't see that at all anywhere and I think that's a shame and I also think that Facebook and Google\nUm had been particularly totally irresponsible in or making sure that the content on their sites as legitimate there there are ways to do that they're not doing\nA lot to talk about when it comes to political ads there was ... when the president and CEO

Republicans had hoped to see judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg was that the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government that the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but inevitably he faced Kevin questions among them given\nThis was last week could the president for sure the American people if Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices\nBack then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year but back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty

frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral puns\nWarehouse or the timber company which leases land his challenge the designation as a potential threat to any future development plans\nAfter the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity explained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know you'd go systems are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language in the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one\nAnd the courts for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is a four to four tie would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a ninth justice depends on how quickly the Senate can hop along [noise]\nNina Totenberg NPR News Washington [noise]\n\nThe damage is extensive and the death toll

scope of the investigation is unclear and has been the subject of political haggling ever since the inquiry was announced on friday\nNPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is here in the studio to walk us through the latest I've got a good afternoon let's start at the White House President Trump held another one of those extended unfiltered press conferences today what did he say about cabin on this investigation stands\nHe said a lot about cabinet but let's just focus for this moment on what he said about the investigation and cabinet ... we've been hearing a lot of reports that the White House had been ordering the FBI to keep the focus very narrow President Trump today insisted that is not the case I Want\nThem to do a very comprehensive ah\nInvestigation whatever that means according to the senators and the Republicans\nDo that and we do know there's been a lot of conversation between the White House and Senate Republicans about this Jeff Flake is the Arizona senator who forced this week long investigation on friday he said today he has been having a lot of talks with the White House app had the other key Republican holdouts here\nThe Judiciary Committee asked the White House to have the FBI investigate current and credible allegations President Trump seems to be referring to Senate Republicans on this so what's our best understanding of how the Senate Republicans define current incredible\nLindsey Graham gave a definition of this over the weekend to ABC News he said that would involve all the witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford said we're at the party\nAnd it also includes Deborah Ramirez who made that second claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party here's the thing that's unclear whether the FBI could or would broaden and talk to college classmates who have come forward saying that cabinet wasn't telling the truth when he testified about his drinking habits and other things like that\nA flake was in Boston today here's what he said about what he wants the scope to be\nThat does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually lead to find out where we can find out\nAt the same time though a Senate Republican leaders are moving forward you've seen them and the White House stepped up their efforts to play up the evidence that undermines what what Ford said and backs with Kavanaugh said and that includes a memo from that prosecutor who did the Republican questioning last week Rachel Mitchell\nSaying that based on the lack of hard evidence a reasonable ... prosecutor would not bring this case against Kavanaugh\nAt this point how much control does the White House and Senate Republican leaders actually have over this process\nHere's what we know we know that they didn't want to be in this position they didn't want to even have a hearing and they wanted to have a vote as soon as today or tomorrow on Kavanaugh's confirmation they didn't do either of those things because a flake and the other Republicans who are on the fence said we're just not comfortable moving forward\nOf the daily looks at Senator Jeff flake of Arizona and his call for an investigation and

afternoon Minnesota DFL party officials say they plan to ask local law enforcement to review and investigation of a domestic abuse allegation against representative Keith Ellison Ellison is the DFL nominees for Minnesota attorney general\nThe move comes after the party's own investigation reportedly failed to substantiate\nThe allegation or ... is following the latest developments on this story and it's here to tell us more and good afternoon yeah thanks for having me so first of all remind us what the allegations are here against Ellison and who was actually investigating it\nFor a friend of Allison's Karen Monaghan said that in twenty sixteen while they were still dating and living together as she was lying in bed and Alison came into the room and grabbed her by her foot and reportedly dragged her off the bed and screamed obscenity is that her\nAs she said there is a video of this incident but she does not want to produce it because it's embarrassing and other victims of abuse haven't had to produce this kind of evidence Allison's though says this video doesn't exist because this never happens\nSo after he won the primary in August to be the nominee for attorney general\nThe party said we need to investigate this further and they hired a lawyer from another law for him to look into it\nOr you know that investigation is out so why then is the DFL asking law enforcement you actually review that investigation\nYeah the investigation was leaked today according to the DFL party wasn't supposed to be released necessarily but that report didn't substantiate the claims it said it hurt claim of abuses its unsubstantiated because she was not willing to produce the video the attorney and that\nReport said she asked her to view it privately but she wouldn't agree to that and she said because she couldn't see the video it was unsubstantiated and the party said look maybe we should have a further review of this by law enforcement officials who review these kind of claims all the time just to make sure people can really trust what they're hearing here\nAnd specifically law enforcement here who's going to look at it do we know\nWe don't know yet that's a good question I don't know exactly what jurisdiction might handle this kind of case but I think we'll find out more than that shortly\nShe'll water Republicans including ... opponent Doug ward low are saying about this if anything so far today\nYeah I mean even before this investigation came out they were calling it a sham investigation because the lawyer and the firm hired by the party has close ties with the party one of the partners the firm has been the party's longtime attorney so they're saying how could um the party and the friends of the party do or\nParty's nominee they were never expecting anything to ah come out of this and today Doug where those said essentially that this is a sham\nA this investigation isn't independent it was never going to find anything even though there's all this other evidence that there there was some kind of domestic abuse so that was his main point today and I think you saw that echoed from other Republicans on social media and other platforms\nWhat about ... and any reaction from him today\nHe released a statement to a written statement today that said I think the party for investigating it and and basically trying to move on to the issues and the attorney general's race this this abuse allegation has been following him since the before the primary and I think he wants to see a everybody move on from it\n[noise] know given the background here of the allegations against a Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh I'm Wondering how the politics on this or playing out you know it's a big question right yeah\nSo that's the other thing Republicans are talking about they're saying\nHow can you justify the optics of this you're calling for an FBI investigation near the highest law enforcement officials in the land to look into the cabinet situation but she won't do the same kind of independent thorough investigation or call for that with Alison I'm there are differences in the situation obviously Ellison will go before the voters in November\nEven as a lifetime appointment that will never go before the voters so there are differences but certainly Republicans are bringing up that optics issue\nSo what can we expect next year where we should find out soon hopefully who is the law enforcement officials are going to actually be investigating this\nAnd that will be really interesting I think critical hopefully we'll get a timeline on how long that's going to take but this was never going to be the last investigation Ellison has called for a house ethics investigation into this as well we haven't heard exactly how that's going to proceed but he's saying please look into it as soon as a member\nA cause for something like that it would likely move forward although with him leaving Congress this year it's also
