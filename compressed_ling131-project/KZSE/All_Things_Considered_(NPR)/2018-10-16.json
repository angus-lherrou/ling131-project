interpret these remarks we called up tomorrow Kaufman with us she served as State Department under President Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nOn his first foreign trip when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who to be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitments as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights

who has picked up President Trump's phrase allergy about fake news and his office\nStill killings of political opponents as well as a drug dealers\nThere is a lot of reason to be concerned that when

away with doing the same thing\nWere lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president condemned the actions of foreign leaders whether that was ... in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this is happening more because President Trump is in office\nI think they're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's blondes a attitude about human rights and democracy it translates into behavior abroad\nThe first of course is if dictators feel like they have a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare but the United states doesn't always criticized directly or one on one sometimes it works together with other western governments\nAnd they all do a day marched

action\nAmerican applicants beyond grades and test scores Harvard rates applicants on personality considerations and the lawsuit alleges that Harvard gave Asian Americans lower personality ratings than other applicants limiting the number of Asian Americans who get in\nSo China's a Harvard senior and shoes Asian American she's part of a group of students scheduled to testify for Harvard up a trial welcome\nThank you so much I'm so happy to be here\nTell me about what you plan to say when you testify at the trial\nI plan to speak very directly about how I really benefitted by being able to talk about race and my being in a Chinese American from a working class background\nFirst generation college student how this was a really big part of my application and my personal statement I spoke very directly about how\nI played the role of translator an advocate for my family and for my parents and how that really developed my sense of social responsibility and my sense of wanting to do work that would have a contribution to my community and the people who need not the most\n[noise] how do you think Harvard's admissions policies helped you or affected you as an applicant to be a student\nWhen I was applying to to college I\nI remember getting a lot of really confusing in conflicting advice I mean for one thing I think my counselor said people with higher scores don't get into Ivy League schools really consider\nSome backups and another counselor who said don't write an Asian immigrant story don't write something that's already been told before and that's been heard before and it isn't going to be compelling and I think those two things were really unsettling I think at the time to think that there is this idea that\nMy story you're mixed variances would not be valued or would not be interesting and you know with scores that weren't valedictorian scores it was a really tough find to be in despite that I\nWhat made me who I Am and when I interviewed my admissions file and major viewers really kind of saw the value in the ways in which I was making these connections from my experience as to what I wanted to do\nIf the students have to look I Want to be judged on my merits alone I Want to be judged solely on my accomplishments how do you respond to that\nI think there is a really beautiful sign at the rally that I helped organize at said merit means nothing without context conversations on campus have evolved\nA lot to reflect this idea that we should you know beyond this case rethink how we are structuring our education systems and how we are viewing\nMerit as if it is something that is reflective through test scores through reductive quantitative methods only the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of\nThe ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nTo seems to be a good chance that this case could reach the Supreme Court where there appears to be a solid majority opposed to affirmative action what are your fears about what happens if this lawsuit proceeds\nI think knowing that you know when it reaches the Supreme Court\nThey won't take additional evidence\nSo student voice that comes through here will be the only voice at the here when it gets to the top there whichever way this case ends up\nBeing decided I think that in the long term thinking about how I think I Want to get a message to future applicants that their stories matter and that they have mattered\nSelling Trump thanks so much thank you so much shoes and Harvard's class of two thousand Nineteen and she's co director of a task force on Asia\nThe undergraduate slated to testify in the trial and later this week we'll

about medical students observing interviews with older patients and it got us thinking what can medical students in their twenties learn from seniors and ordered doctors continuously learning from them so Dr John ... back from the U. of M. with more on the value of\nListening for the students and for him in the clinic John good to have you back next on how valuable is it this exercise for a twenty five year old medical students to obesity listening to an interview with an elderly patient\nOh I think it's really important I think that younger students and medical students tend to be younger um\nHave somewhat limited experience with older patients and and you know my grandparents but they're they're you know it's it's a focus limited amount of exposure and this\nYou know often these stories are designed these interviews are designed to really open their minds to what is possible as you get older and certainly tempered by some limitations but also showing the possibility of aging and and and um you know changing their preconceived notions\nBreak down some of the stereotypes they may have about a elderly people absolutely\nOver time and your time as a as an empty in the approach to the way we treat and an approach older patients\nWell I think that we have so many older patients and by older patients I mean people into the upper eighties into their low nineties I got one patient who's Ninety eight\nSo we have no choice but to sort of a change or approach a little bit you know it takes longer for patients to even get to the exam room and to check in and we have sort of to allow for that\nUm stories take a little longer to unfold\nSo these are visit that do not lend themselves to a ten minute or even a Fifteen minute a slot most of the time so we we have to be adaptable there have been more patients with really memory loss and so that as a whole nother dimension to how we provide care and that is something that has changed over the last two decades plus for me in practice\nNow we hear about it and read about a shortage of geriatric specialists does that mean that a a family medicine doctors like yourself are doing more and more of this\nOh no question I think those of us in internal medicine I'm In and family medicine that sort of the two main specialties they'd probably have the bulk of people who are in you know there are considered a geriatric age\nAnd you know there are only something like you know less than eight thousand board certified geriatrician than the United states so there's no way even if we started today and in cranked out more geriatrician that we would have enough for everybody so we have no choice but to incorporate geriatric practice into our clinic settings\nNow you have a I'd say a sympathy for storytelling right this is a part of the practice that you like uh so what have you learned over the years from listening to older patients and their life stories and how valuable as had been\nOh gosh it's so valuable I mean I think of visits I have I'm with my patients especially my older patients who have life experience they have traveled to have been places they've done things I mean that's the one patient who was in France ...\nI was a child on the shores and to make those connections so you know in primary care we're relationship based and so the joy of seeing people get older to know them over decades is this amazing privilege and frankly if you own was guilty of times\nWe'll send you their stories and really not getting paid to talk to my patients about their lives but I Know for a fact that that makes for better clinical care and you know better visits and you know I I Can't imagine practicing medicine without that aspect\nDr John ... is an associate professor in the department
