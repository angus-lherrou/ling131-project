in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turnaround here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their has through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant\nSupport comes from urban home works stable homes offer long term positive effects on families consider joining these stability makers a group of donors who believe in the power of equitable and

I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and step son the has the each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs it's beautiful here too yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry and the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did it the auto plant but he says it's enough\nNot happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people always great and then general\nDoor and you know we all go our separate ways back then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck [noise] current workplace\nPolicies that eighty so you're good\nToday Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scrubs\nA little bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year the\nNet after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent\nUsed to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\nI'm not going to say a big percentage of them [noise]\nI guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoyed your life after that but I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like John Green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when\nHe was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like AT T's really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were far north\nStars are running [laughter] [noise] that's near the river and my sister\nThose are fireworks

crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did it willow run and what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something or you know the current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the ...\nThis is his first time inside the gates since that\nDay [noise] drugs have him six hurting the freeway\nEnter our tour guide is Jeff Rupp he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting has passed\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there yeah so we\nWe left that\nWe like the trees like the leaves on the street it's kinda cool kind of eerie and [laughter]\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing traffic jams Haagen horns\nOur melts cars are driving by themselves and a crazy world\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross bar underneath and faded black paint you can barely make out the ghost of another logo United Auto workers and the name of the union chapter that Skidmore represented local seven thirty five [noise]\nMm\nIs NPR News you want to keep up on current affairs and a lot to

leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol ...\nWe've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and the caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet a tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nThere has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling math\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior and that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped them are over\nThe border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise] President Trump says he has\nPlans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details\nAbout that right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal in international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted with the travel ban then he'll give that his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's

Minnesota Public radio news\nFormer Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords brought her campaign against gun violence to Minnesota today she survived a twenty eleven shooting left or with severe injuries and she called on Minnesotans to support candidates who support universal background checks and other gun laws\nSki you have the courage to fight [noise] staying with me though those\nEarlier this year it looked as if the political debate over gun laws we shaping up to be a prominent election issue but as things have played out guns haven't been as front and center as health care and the economy in the fall campaign even so that\nAs Brian Banks reports after Seventeen students in Stafford gunned down in February at a Florida high school there were new calls for firearm restrictions in Minnesota hearings rallies incidence didn't produce any changes to gun laws\nSupporters of new laws were incensed and vowed to use the legislative defeat to motivate voters errands em off the lead volunteer for moms men action Minnesota was among those who went to work\nBut we are right now looking for gun since candidate Air Canada thing for them we our phone banking we're showing up at four O. one supporting candidates his support commonsense gun safety or harm\nHer group is under the umbrella of every town for gun safety and has its sights set on flipping some Republican held state house seat mostly in the suburbs\nEverytime plans to spend one million dollars on his Minnesota effort that includes direct candidate contributions and brochures already landing in mailboxes\nThem off says there's still lots of intensity around the issue she says candidates for local office up through statewide races aren't as bashful as before and declaring support for expanded background checks and protective orders\nAnd I think this election all prisoners that advocating for gun safety is not only the right thing to do um but it's also good politics\nDFL candidate for governor Tim Walz probably knows how we went from a rating from gun groups as a congressman\nToo when asked as a candidate this year for supporting tougher gun laws\nWalls was on hand when Gabby Giffords came to Minnesota today a political action committee associated with her has already spent more than one point three million dollars in Minnesota federal records showed his opponent tire lead to the states second congressional district race with a group of seeking the defeat of Republican incumbent Jason Lewis\nIt is run ads like this featuring an air force veteran and sharp shooter I Know what can happen\nSister was murdered with a gun the spending on behalf of gun rights candidates hasn't been as real bust the national Rifle Association has directed about two hundred and forty thousand dollars to Minnesota so far most has gone to the open eighth congressional district\nA leader of the Minnesota gun owners ... says his group will come close to matching the every town investment on state level races\nBut cook is political director Rob door says he's not worried about the call for gun restrictions motivating voters on the other side\nUsing it as a rallying cry typically doesn't win over moderates and it certainly doesn't win over Republicans\nDoor says his group is playing defense but also thinks it can help turn out voters opposed to more regulations in key districts\nBut he's also on the lookout for defections bypass supporters he was alarmed by a mailing on behalf of third district Republican congressmen Erik Paulsen hailing him as a co sponsor of gun safety proposals the mailing was set by the state Republican Party\nAnd that's very concerning to us because it endorses some of the things that we're staunchly against you know with universal background checks and registration with the red flag restraining orders the abuses of due process there endorsing those from a party mailer is very problematic\nDoors ears also perked up last weekend during a televised attorney general debate when moderator Tom Hauser of case D.
