cover\nThe five different you know topics a day or whatever was going on with him and he was out of the mold and there was no real standard for the way to cover somebody like this which is something I think\nThe reporters the White House press corps is dealing with right now how do you cover this it's uncharted territory and you in some ways make it up as you\nGo and the lawmakers eventually realized they had to find a way to kind of curry favor with the governor right so that they could get him on their side of an issue as they knew\nThe only one that was going to get reported on in any significant way was the governor is it possible to detach that big personality and the men who like you said throughout three things that day\nAnd look at the policies of what he was able to do as governor well on a day to day basis it was hard to make sense of anything because it was so haphazard and it would evolve and change every day he\nSomething that ... that most governors will not and
