world nation stand on curbing carbon emissions and avoiding it climate catastrophe but first\nThursday morning two astronauts on route to the international space station had to abort their launch after a booster rocket malfunctioned made an emergency dissent back to earth and they're happy to report\nAmong safely Rachel Feldman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and others so like Detroit subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe thanks for having me Ira anything more about what went wrong there\nYet so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure\nAnd they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic landing a ballistic descent which is so called because\nUsually they uh make kind of on a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of lift and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rocket is really coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because uh they were supposed to come back down to the ground in the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a launch and um the Russian space agency said immediately they would begin investigating and uh so far that that's all we know\nOne of the good news about it is that it worked right [laughter] right [laughter] right and again this is a rare but the kind of things that astronauts\nTrain for all the time it's not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not something we want to have happened but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWell what what what what's their Soyuz capsule being the only way for humans to reach the international space station there's been this now you know a little bit of a problem there's no other way to get up there right\nSo there are um I Believe three so use missions planned that are now kind of up in the air because the Russian

there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security the federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems how does all of this affect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from\nFour seven to four to five five eight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms\nLet me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\nLife here and it's nice to have you um [noise] well I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of conversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is\nA tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases or the roles that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one election systems vendor which uh manufacturers eat pull books was attacked but I think\nUm we don't we don't know exactly what was\nOh just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there was something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems my actually I think they may still\nThey may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them I'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and deal with registration databases\nUm electronic pull books or what you can kind of what our use their off in a ... a tablets or or ... or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said I last I checked I think they have they they moved in either direction we successfully breached but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome dinner and it sounded like them that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised [noise] well\nUm [noise] ah well that's actually quite a controversial question ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um\nPerhaps to influence the elections ranging from um affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines that systems um the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking about um you\nUm they got attacked there was a voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan scan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you\nMade a reference to the DEF CON um activities\nAnd so what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the um what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access\nThat in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them\nUm you would need some sort of inside job um that would require a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing 'cause it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against on the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nDuring the ... hour they right\nKind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um our inner taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election\nBeing there in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we are doing that um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could\nI think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify\nThat the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of uh thinking that the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of\nAnd are highly unlikely to be subjected to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the states to move in directions\nTo make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI could just jump in real quick point um I I\nI I think there to to build on on what Charles just said uh I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um\nElection infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and it is an example of that might an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets report it out and uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states or that I Know of but in other countries ... election reporting attacked\nUm and um if if you get ... incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nUm a lot of false information put out on social meter I was talking earlier about that level of interference from the Russians and the two thousand sixteen election casting doubt on election outcomes if you don't have as a as we don't in\nAnd think about things that bring you the most

a call one eight hundred chi chi seven twenty eleven and thanks thanks\nFor your support thanks for joining us here for science friday on NPR News\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature to quote will below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future\nIt's rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and more powerful storms and to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius\nBut how much does half a degree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the inter governmental panel on climate change the IPC see this week has shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years is\nDr Kelly the Vin she is senior associate with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much you\nWant to send out a shout out to our listeners but you know with this question as we barrel Tour de one and a half degree increase in global temperature are you worried are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give ... give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to for eight to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us ... fry 'em so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nThat even a one point five degree increase is going to bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right said that and has a government actually has these two goals as he said to limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees\nOf the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\n'em and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference in ... for example\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming\nOn at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming if you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses um two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects I'm almost forty percent worse\nDegrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic I said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs where the report found that\nOne point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nDoesn't look like there's any where we're going to be able to stay on the river to orange or whatever\nSo what the report finds is that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on\nThere have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happened on right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the combination rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to meet one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices on a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them\nHe wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can you can you answer at least who commissioned do what they do they use [noise]\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision on requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists and had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being\nUm reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case on there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea um\nAbout a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policymakers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\n[noise] mhm [noise] ah we're a lot of people want to talk about what I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice\n[noise] yes hello so culture and I think what ends up confusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it\nWhat really hurts us and I will culture is the high temperature is the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced
