and a half years old\nWhat I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mind said whether it be towards chemistry sports um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your thoughts on the subject how to identify your kids\nOr younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science physics\n[noise] did you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you want to I\nWas lucky my father was the nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls to do math just as well as boys could so he never discussed\nFor others to compete with and I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them are good kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\nMhm I'm a ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age was talented in science\nI think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage someone\n... have a tweet from Sydney who says please ask what she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urged to bury thing\n[laughter] I Wish I knew but it's clear that many

we sequence more things and under ... and measure their properties will be using important and powerful tools like machine learning to peace out and to try to pull out what is that genetic

the issues they get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately\nOur guest is Dr Eugene you change a mathematician a scientist and residents at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in

really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male\nYou know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist systems that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide journalistic systems unknowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to to identify as a feminist um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist system and so\nI'm being able to see the fact that you know I can still be a male male experiences while existing at I mean that's\nI'm In identifying myself and it's such a way really changed my mind I'm In the thought about that\nThat's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening he's ... he's you know as part of the problems that we don't see how we are there see yes\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we all from spent on trying to defend our end points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed as he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that to somebody else's analogous experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions do require map it requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect and their their view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think that logic does not require math that logic is in a way pauses math\nAnd these things have poorest boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects that bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deep steeped in this scene of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not\nLet's talk about some some uh current events or it's turned out to the oddest topic in current events and that is voters in Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault ticket and it's a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process is at play and tell me what you mean by that\nWell that's a whole other our whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because a lot of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials and it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principle\nSpeech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for things and things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to presume ... someone innocent until that until that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused person or let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a paradox because we can't actually hold the mom and the woman both innocence at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and civil Sufi have studied paradoxes for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look up ... will that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time it it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that world and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...
