eight for for seven to for eight to five five or tweet at science ... but first last week's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change gave us a sobering look at what a world worn by two degrees Celsius might look like\nAll announced that it was throwing financial support behind the U.S carbon tax it's a big step for one of the world's largest oil companies which last year was sued by its own employees for misleading statements about the environmental and financial impact of fossil fuels\nAnd has a history of denying the climate science settled here with the story as well as other short subjects in science is on there are finding a staff writer for vox mayor welcome back to science friday\nThanks for having me again so Exxon says it's going to back us carbon tax on a surface that sounds like a good thing but what exactly are they proposing\nProposing to back a lobbying effort launched by conservative former secretaries of state George Schultz and James Baker this is a group called the climate leadership council and it proposes starting with a forty dollars per ton price on carbon dioxide emissions and that price would rise overtime\nThan they would use that money to go back to people like you and me essentially in the form of a dividend or rebate and the estimate is that what started about two thousand dollars a year for a family of four\nThere is a catch though and Exxon wants ... ... a roll back some other environmental regulations and one big catches that they want immunity from climate change related law suits that want damages for these companies it's the same\nDeal that the the gun producers have [noise]\nYeah pretty much it's kind of analogous to what they got and it's what I'm other industries have also tried to get\nA Exxon has a complicated relationship with climate change it it's been ahead of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem\nThey've had researchers who helped author the I. T. C. C. report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuels years ago in in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers\nSaying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another\nGood sort of thing that's always the question isn't it I mean the thing to remember a Exxon is that they are an investor owned company so they do have to answer to their shareholders and they've been getting a lot of pressure in shareholder meetings to better address climate change also climate change poses a business risk for them um in terms of their facilities and\nIf they aren't out ahead on this they might get slapped with a carbon policy that they don't like that doesn't actually work in their favor and another way a carbon tax might actually benefit them is that it would target the dirtier fuels first things like coal which would clear some space for one of axons other products natural gas\nVery lovely fall

Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of C sections happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now a series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick\nWhat are the effects on mothers in babies and what into vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rates globally\nAlso what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like

sixty nine countries and overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world\n[noise] well it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over U C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous his um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... and about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and ...\nOver ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted norm is part of the culture in in Brazil\nAre there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the province [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... is his area and is not a low risk a surgery it is it's a major surgery ends and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states who are increasing maternal mortality rate\n... you mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and why\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when women really needs it and I think it's important to to stay in the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that in

about this um [noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the due to do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... in the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and it\nTurns out that that's not really the most significant driver hum in our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is a tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise and sit there and deliver right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about their doctors who actually are performing and\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make a recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible um it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put
