lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test oh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be\nYou're saying is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skinned as is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars\nSo I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so
