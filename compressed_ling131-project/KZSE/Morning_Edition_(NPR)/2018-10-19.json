Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is claiming a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how was the last changed since the Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote and wait for the ... barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial uh at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd as the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nWhat about the the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens' well of course black\nMen were given the right to vote in the fifteenth amendment and Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws in the south effective\nIt's in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five built a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registrars had frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about using himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote earlier or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy paying their chart and I live in Omaha Nebraska\nWhen I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me and I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office addressed how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWhile they're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require a current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing icy irony that the nation's original residents are being questioned\nAbout their residency very dark irony thanks so much
