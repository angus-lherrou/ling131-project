all the deal is also the prerequisite for any sort of a trance a transition period\nSo if there was no deal then everything's going to happen overnight and so I think both sides have a very great

happening\nI think the second reason is is that the I mean one of the big problems in these negotiations from the beginning has been that it's been taken your case so long to arrive to any position and it's been negotiating justice not much with itself as it has with the new at this summer we actually got this so called checkers proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nOr when it was the first
