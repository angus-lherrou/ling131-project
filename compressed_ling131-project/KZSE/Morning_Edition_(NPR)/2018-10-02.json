inspector general she was a breakdown in communication across the Minneapolis would be a system the facility employee suicide prevention coordinators who work with high risk patients\nBut Miller was never flag just a high level suicide risk so we never got that help neutral several nurses he had easy access to guns but denied that fact others\nNo one noticed inconsistency\nLater when his parents called the VA looking for updates some departments didn't even know Miller had been discharged it was only after that phone call that VA staff search their parking lot in San ... body Harrington had none of this information until the inspector general's report was released\nAnd it was a lot of the same\nAll over again the same way when we found out that he had died and the first place\nShe doesn't blame the doctors or nurses for what happened she says a lack of resources and funding stopped them from helping her brother she hopes that telling his story will change things the VA John

historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade\nHurt their members interest by off shoring jobs\nSo it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal but to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nUnless strong labor and environmental standards are subject\nThe outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal wallich cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrace\nChad ... is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics he says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now has to be made with\nWorkers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars will be compliant with the new rules that down says it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia or if you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper places to build automobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor games from the deal ...

they are being honored for quote groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics\nTwo of the three work together one worked independently\nAnd one is a woman the first to receive a Nobel in physics in decades NPR's Geoff Brumfiel is years after morning good morning okay the pairing first as you are are more room or French scientist and Donna Strickland a Canadian both of whom did much of their work at the University of Rochester what does that work\nThey did something called a shirt pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development of the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago\nAnd then they stole it out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal as it to see strictly to see her name attached to the Nobel Prize in physics\nWell this is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in the past hundred and Fifteen Years while uh the the last one was in Nineteen sixty three and so Donald strict them was asked about this in the press conference in even she seem a bit surprised by that\nFact you are that the woman ever getting that no prize in physics let's get comments on that\n... okay I thought there might have been but I think\nIt's true yeah there's only been to others I'm Marie ... mayor in Nineteen sixty three and Marie Curie in Nineteen oh three and there are many good female physicists who has been widely held were overlooked\nDoes surprise does this suggest a an advancement for women physicists\nI'd say it's more like the Nobel Prize is trying to stay relevant in the heart scientists especially ah Internet entrepreneur and started this new age we're in have started giving their own prices this year one of those prices went to a woman named Justin Bell burnout who had herself and overlooked for a Nobel Prize\nThat prize was first three million dollars the Nobel or just for around a million new so you know I think the Nobel Prizes are falling behind the times and they recognize that and\nThat's really interesting okay there's a third Nobel Prize winner Arthur Ashe gun is his name Bell Labs and New Jersey the place where he did much of his work um optical tweezers is the phrase in front of my eyes here what an optical tweezers\nAre actually exactly what they sound like which using lasers which is light tumbled physical things\nWe have it or not light can exert a little bit of pressure and so if you tuned to lasers just right you can manipulate very very small things are really tiny particles when you're ... ... individual Adams even wow and so what are the practical applications of the work of these three people\nWhile the optical tweezers are used in a variety of applications um for moving around small biological molecules proteins DNA things like that and also in physics it's used pretty widely [noise]\nUm and then the lasers are the main sort of public use most common uses laser eye surgery are pulse simplification

providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim Wu is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nThey actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for that\nI I think that they they uh uh I have decided they really want to have a a a environment where are you know it's it's open for business I guess as their argument and ah they're concerned that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this as an issue as interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the uh the broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nUm but you know about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California's going to say is listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know it's just between it's just that thing in your home and the wire to my local state that's all they care about they're not trying to\nControl everything and so I think that's a what a California's argument will be\nWhat is the president just get sad and dozens of other states are considering that in ... last night\nAnd in fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality laws you know it gets it gets to a very fundamental policy question which is\nOne of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically feeling gaps the federal government has abandoned net neutrality um ah for reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union\nIn other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states I feel differently Internet's that started California where it's where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular scrimmage and in California we should note his is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of France\nOn climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is is dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word the California law on the other hand it's a question of the California law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I think almost all of them on the they've all said they they like a net neutrality law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast or or AT and T. we'll we'll try to charge them extra block their content know most people have vast majority Americans wanting to tell the laws that sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to this law the it's the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised so many states are are trying to fill in the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time it's been
