a revolution in cancer treatment\nThan about the family have decided to warn the ah two thousand Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine jointly to James Holmes who ...\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris Corning Richard good morning so who are these two winners well the price\nSeventy year old biologist who's now with the NBA Anderson Cancer center in Houston and also by to sue ... who's at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes it's a complete surprise me or not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells and they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system in check sort of think of them is the brakes on your immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution and cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have her now that we've talked about them a fair amount on our airplanes and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Allison the other scientists who is winning this word ...\n... yesterday and know that him a hundred work independently of Jim Alison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one and ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... true to nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective target so fascinating\nSo how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how how we think about ... well before\nFocus not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world of immunotherapy is no really the driving force behind drug development\nThese rights I mean we hear a lot about him you know therapy how effective are these new therapies that's what one really wants to know a win\nAnd that's an evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies of failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in his recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nBut researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of cancer research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end of\nThe ... okay NPR science correspondent Richard Harris those Nobel winners thank you so much my pleasure It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Cathy

R. go dot com\nJoins us in Studio good to see a good morning why is this important\nSo I Would say this plan is important for two main reasons the first is the scope of it there are nearly one hundred ideas in here that will guide Minneapolis his policy making over the next two decades\nNow most of them are pretty broad like the city will take climate change into account when designing storm water infrastructure but others are very specific like how tall buildings are allowed to be or whether you're allowed to build a factory here or an apartment there\nAnd that brings me to the second reason this document is important which is it has actual legal authority the city's zoning code and other regulations must conform to this comprehensive plan so while there may not be specific laws in this document per se the la city council creates or the next Twenty years must be in line with this document\nNow I Know that four Plex his are getting a lot of attention in this plan that's the proposal that you could build up to four apartments on any parcel of land in the city is that right [laughter]\nThat's right but it's not in there anymore and city planners released a new draft late last week and they scaled back\nProposal to allow just up to three units on residential lots so what that means practically speaking is that any homeowner in Minneapolis to turn an addict or a garage into separate apartments of course developers did also knocked down single family homes to build try Plex is\nRight now most lots in the city or is known for single family homes so this would dramatically increase how many people to live in the city\nAnd I think it's worth underlining how significant the change would be when you look at other cities across the country even New York city Chicago in Seattle have parts of their city we're only single family\nAn overstatement to say this would be a nationally significant change in land use policy and why do Minneapolis city planners think that this is necessary\nThey say it's necessary because there's a housing shortage Minneapolis is population is now growing for the first time since the Nineteen forties and allowing up to three units on any plot of land with ... lots of people ... units of the city [noise]\nAnother thing driving this policy which I think is interesting is to make the city more livable for its older residents\nHeather Worthington the city is director for a long range planning said that this would help people each in place so someone could build an apartment over the garage for a family member or a home health care aide it could provide additional income and someone's retirement or she says it could help someone moved to something smaller but stay in the same neighborhood\nBeing close to family members or support systems like faith community can make a big difference in terms of how you age in place and you know what we believe too is that from an equity standpoint that should not just be available to people who have high income\nOf course there are many people who are not happy with the idea of letting anyone turn their house into a three year not apartment building\nThey say it's way too drastic change and they're afraid their neighborhoods as they know them are going to be destroyed ... okay what's next what's next is this will go before the city's planning commission like you said they'll have a public hearing on October twenty ninth\nThen it goes before the city council in November So more changes are possible but city stopper calling this latest version the final draft\nSo it seems are coming down the home stretch of this year's long\nProcess alright max thank you You're welcome access direct as a producer for NPR News programming supported by the University of Minnesota colleges pharmacy offering a reminder that pharmacists are the medication experts on your health care team get to know your pharmacist and support American pharmacists month pharmacy dot U.
