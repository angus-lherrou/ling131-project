open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nDirt SARS has a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages while the whole phenomenon\nOf the pipe bombs or business surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack\nThat I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important moment politician I'm spearheading

hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty\nHe was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties\nHe's technically shouldn't make him rich\nWell I'm In the nineties a specialty was a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England\nCouldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark and weren't sources right or the pound collapse are us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy a descended into some chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIt again in his native Hungary and then in other Eastern European countries where his ... he had a clear\nPolitical confidence which was to build for realism so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties own words but the switch came in two thousand three

inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked in the media and you are a Republican member of Congress to say well the media was slurring me because of sort of saw us and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros peculiar become seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talk to you if you just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you caught expanding Russian neighbors actually his philanthropy is called the open society Institute He's very open about it he ... about where the

said it's because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he says like the rest of America Democrat in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you've got\nWords of the political farms women you can almost see other county law and the shift between the Democratic signs are on one father John me live and you're moving to another\nOur country the line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask county commissioner ray Gasper sense says the areas about sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected Democrats\nAnd when he sees his party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state is turning blue\nWe have a hundred and ... and ... to ... or ... rule which for him to go much more Republican\nCounty Republican chairman diction honesty says rural Republican voters like Trump\nI'm seeing a trend where there's a movement away from the Democratic party to the Republican Party just because there is a
