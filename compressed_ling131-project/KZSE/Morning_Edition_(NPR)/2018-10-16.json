offices along sided store the plan never got off the ground as the company continued to face headwinds\nSears bankruptcy filing this week is the latest part of a rise and fall son that that unbeknownst to many had roots here in Minnesota Richard W Sears was born in steward villa near Rochester during the civil war\nYou know twenty ten interview with NPR News former saint John's university history professor Annette Atkins said Sears was working at a railroad depot in redwood falls when an unwanted shipment of watches rolled in\nSerious and I wonder if I could sell them so he sold off that first batch in and I link\nThat within a few months he quit his job he'd gone to Minneapolis and he was running a watch business Sears would soon move the company to Chicago and hire a watch repairman named Alvin Roebuck\nThe two went on to found an empire that dominated American retail first through an encyclopedic mail order catalogue in retail stores\nThe bankruptcy filing does not bring an end to the one hundred twenty five year old business but it severely diminishes its footprint as recently as two thousand five when it combined with Kmart Sears Holdings operated twenty two hundred stores\nAfter this latest round of closures there will be little more than five hundred nationwide while many k-mart stores are closing is well known in Minnesota is on the list Matt Sepic of Minnesota Public radio news\nIf we had in mind our allies leading the house of representatives they could do badly needed oversight on the minister Asians effort to cater to the leaders every day over our communities\nThat word oversight is one you hear a lot from Democrats in part because there's not a whole lot else they can do most of the roll back some environmental policy are happening in the executive branch under Trump appointees a shift in house leadership won't change that\nDemocrats can't force interior secretary Ryan Zinke you to restore Bears Ears national monument for example or to crack down on methane emissions but they can force him to explain himself\nArizona congressman ... is the ranking Democrat on the house natural resources committee\nI Want to change the narrative of this\nNot just the past the part of the Trump Administration that the independent and that they have responsibility is co equals for oversight and accountability\nTranslation expect hearings lots of them if Democrats retake the house Tom pile heads the American energy alliance which supports Trump's agenda he says a Democratic majority in the house would be a setback for the administration\nAnd they will be able to tighten up mercilessly so that they would kinda be able to slow walk a lot of the good work that's being done with respect to these issues\nDemocrats already have a working list here's Colorado congresswoman Diane and to get the ranking Democrat on the oversight committee for energy and commerce\nI think you will be seeing investigations in hearings around the methane rule they claimed power plant and they think car rules you're going to be seeing I look more in depth\nConflicts of interest in corruption at the EPA\nAnd the list goes on to get says this year's midterms reminder of what happened in two thousand six when Democrats took back the house under President George W. Bush for the following two years Democrats called hearings and investigations and crafted legislation that they knew would not passed under Republican president\nBut then when President Obama was elected in two thousand eight we were able to move of Rebecca legislative agenda because we had spent the last two years developing you\nKnow of course Republicans could keep their majority in Congress which would mean continued support for the administration's deregulatory agenda Nathan Rott NPR News\nAnd later today on all things considered the outcome of the mid term elections could also have a major effect on the future of us health policy it can listen to that story by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your local member station ...\nGood morning from the BBC in London\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...
