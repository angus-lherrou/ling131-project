Judiciary Committee are getting a chance to read a single copy of an FBI report this is the results of the agencies supplemental investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual assault when he was younger\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell said last night we should say before he read the report that the first vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation\nTom remembers review and be briefed on the supplemental material\nBefore friday cloture vote\nSo I'm falling cloture on judge Kavanaugh's nomination this evening so the process can move forward I Want to bring in NPR's Ryan Lucas who has been following this story morning Ryan good morning\nSo let's start with the FBI investigation itself I mean this was never supposed to actually draw conclusions about these allegations against Kevin randomly remind us what additional information the Senate was hoping to to get from this supplemental background check as they're calling it\nWell the answer to that question kind of depends on whether you're a Republican or Democrat so what Republicans wanted was for the FBI to focus on that Christine Blasey Ford's allegations\nAre and the second allegation from Deborah Ramirez about sexual misconduct or that they allege a Brett Kavanaugh committed a Ramirez is of course a classmate of Kavanaugh's uh her story is that a cabinet exposed himself to her at a party when they're both in college\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations in for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off to do so\nOr Democrats have also increasingly talked about Kavanaugh's drinking\nUm since that could have bearing on his behavior at the time of the legit incidents but the key thing to remember here is that uh the White House is the one in control of background investigation and the scope the FBI does this background investigation at the behest of the White House the president controls the parameters and the president has said\nWhile he's fine if the FBI talks to anybody out there or that he was providing direction to the FBI based off of what Senate Republicans wanted\nThe

California Good morning China's ambassador believes the United states needs to make up its mind sway ten ... says the United states doesn't seem to know what it once on trade in the middle of this escalating conflict\nSway is China's man in Washington this elegantly dressed diplomatic veteran and he sat down with Steve Inskeep for a rare interview\nWhat used preventing an end to the trade war with the United states\nWe certainly don't want a trade deal well with the United says oh was in as a country you have one yeah this is there a fortune is but\nGood will and the good faith from both sides\nAre you seeing good well are good faith from the United states\nWell tell the truth or not sufficiently what is the evidence of that\nWell for instance so us position keeps changing all the time so we do know is actually whether us would want as priorities we're ready to make a deal where I read it to make some compromise but in need the good will from both sides\nBastard you use the word priorities I'm reminded that a few months ago the U.S treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin went to China for some negotiations and it was sad that the United states made a very wide range of demands that were rejected out of hand by China\nIs that what you mean by priorities that you want the United states to pick a few items rather than demanding every complaint be fixed it once\nWas actually in the last few months that would be contact between the two governments and the ... off but\nTo reduce the trade deficit of the United states for instance and we also present a very good proposal to the side about the further reform and open up in China I seen them more than once we had some tentative agreement between the two ... teams\nThen just overnight the tentative agreement was rejected and that demands from us changed so this is very confusing\nThat perhaps leads to another question um what is your method for trying to determine what the president of the United states thinks\nWell we'll have to look at the ah ... we have to look at the the L was the U.S team was tell us or the negotiating table [noise] but I think that we still need more good faith\nOne day and another star a very different started another day then you've got confused\nUm do you follow the president's Twitter feed\nWell I think many people are falling over each it as a ... so we're just doing the same but\nDo you find meaningful information they're some of his political allies will say disregard that there's actual policies or something else\nHonesty I think if it's written by the president it has to be meaningful\nThere was a news story here are suggesting that foreign embassies and consulates were buying large numbers of copies of a Bob Woodward book about the inner workings of the White House is the Chinese embassy filled with copies of Bob Woodward's book\nNatural that people would like to get a copy and see what happens what is between the book\nIs that yes you have lots of copies of fear around the Chinese embassy\nI don't know it's really you it's really up to the individuals whether they want to abide for not I certainly have a copy so I have talked to many other impacts of this year we all share the same ... all of us want to have a better understanding of what is happening here and what it would mean for us\nDo you feel you understand the president at this point well ah I Hope that could have a better understanding what have you thought about as there have been news reports that the administration has considered proposals to ban Chinese students for studying at American University's\nIf this is true I think that this is a very dangerous situation because so many Chinese students are studying here and a growing number of American students studying China such people to people contact\nWould be the real foundation of friendship and the cooperation between the two countries and I could give you a very specific is it on pause in the state of Indiana Indiana Indian\nChildren's museum sure it's a great one it's a great one and a few years ago the museum hosted a big big event on Chinese culture and I was invited to address the opening ceremony and I had a meeting with then governor Mike Pence\nGovern the past it was a great supporter to such people to people in the cultural exchanges so why should we cut off all the ties or the natural ties between now to people's\n[noise] would you encourage greater openness going the other way if Americans scholars who may have controversial opinions wants to visit China if American journalists want to go to sensitive areas like Tibet would you encourage greater openness on China's part\nYou see well open to\nAmerican students professors journalists scholars of cause uh for some of the ... not too bad because it's very high are accused and the uh the comments could be very tough that\nVery high altitude yeah I think American journalist and scholars could handle the altitude I mean we have ... states\nWell not everybody but it could quickly get used to such comment unnatural conditions even for Chinese men over them would not feel very well what ... what\nAbout weaker areas and far northwest of China\nWell at this is part of China so the whole country is open to the rest of them would suddenly this part is also open but honestly it\nIn this part of China we have a particular problem that is terrorism that are violent extremist groups I'm sure some people are there some attempt\nTo create a situation like the ice is in that part of China\nHave you thought about is the United nations has said that hunter\nHad been put into camps you see very often widespread star as may not be the true stars I think whatever we're doing in that part of China is for the wellbeing and save the security of the people that are you putting people in camps to do that\nIt's not you see first of all we have to take measures to make sure that\nGroups a lot like ISIS will not be spreading into positron secondly we have to make sure that people have means to build a better life for them to learn more skills they have to learn techniques to develop themselves\nAnd also we have to maintain local stability people will\nBe listening carefully to your words um they may hear you saying that yes there are camps at ... are you saying there or not\nI'm not saying as al ...
