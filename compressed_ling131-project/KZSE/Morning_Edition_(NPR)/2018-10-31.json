John immigration at the issue that will drive Republicans to the polls\nAt least his hardcore supporters late last week the administration reportedly floated the idea of an executive order that would bar all migrants including those seeking asylum from entering the United states at the southern border then came the announcement on Monday to the Pentagon is deploying more than five thousand troops the border and then yesterday\nCame the idea of scrapping a key piece of the fourteenth amendment what's known as birthright citizenship\nThrough an executive order how ridiculous we're the only\nIncomes and has a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits it's ridiculous it's ridiculous and it has to end up all of false statements their most notably the United states is one of more than thirty notions with birthright citizenship\nAlso worth noting overturning a constitutional amendment is really really difficult to advocates is an NPR White House correspondent and co host of the politics podcast and joins us now from wanting to him the morning so is the president's anti immigrant message something that resonates with Republicans writ large or is this about really what Steve said his personal base of support\nIt it is the number one issue for Republicans the Kaiser Family foundation a has a poll out that that finds that if you ask Republican voters their top issue ... twenty five percent of them which is the highest of any other issue will say immigration is their number one issue\nIt's not nearly as salient with Democrats or with independence so this is about Republicans and this is in particular about Trump Republicans this is an issue that President Trump um has has felt worked for him a and and he hopes will be able to transfer to candidates he supports\nHe felt it really worked for him in the Republican primary in twenty sixteen\nAnd I guess we should just note the way the politics in the media work you can say something wildly impractical completely irrelevant not that important caravan caravan birthright citizenship and even if it's not very practical it focuses attention focuses the mind on the issue that the president wants people to be thinking\nMm\n[noise]\n\nOn the next fresh air how the Supreme Court became so politicized\nHow the court look now with the Trump appointees

she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity did I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I think so too\nI I I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you\nDid you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics or we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity [laughter] how did that take shape short it was after the\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from your age

conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with us when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more\nCompassion towards the rights that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but I I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't and [noise]\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that\nThis crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it\nWith you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of bullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side I think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left\nSnowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered [noise]\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump's correct\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that\nRather than based on strictly\nGoing out and filling out all of the Democratic checked boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI has been avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nAlexa grooming thank you so much for talking with I think you know\n... ... ... ...\nThis is NPR News hundreds of black women are running in federal state and local elections which black women have been the most reliably voting constituency for many years for the Democratic party and so this is about more than just respecting our vote but is about respecting an honoring\nOur leadership I'm Ari Shapiro surgeon black women running for office this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\n\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoors through October and indoor markets open throughout the winter you can visit farmers' markets of M.
