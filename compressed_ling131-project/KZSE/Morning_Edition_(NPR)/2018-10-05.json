Eighteen point four cents per gallon and yet the cost of building and maintaining roads and bridges are going up here's more from NPR's David Schaper\nFirst week of October Nineteen Ninety three the

one of the top movies that year started\nBill Murray Frida I'm reliving the same day over and over\nGroundhog Day it was about bill Murray's character getting caught in the time loop and he spends decades reliving the same Groundhog Day those of us that have followed the gas tax debate can't help but feel some of that same repetition\nCarl Davis is with the nonpartisan Institute on taxation and economic policy and he says that's because the federal gas tax is still the same Eighteen point four cents a gallon that it was when Groundhog Day was playing in theaters twenty five years ago\nThe whole reason this tax exists is to keep our roads paved and to keep our bridges from falling down and to do that effectively that needs to collect a sustainable amount of revenue over time and it can't do that if it's just not updated for decades at a time\nWith rising construction and labor costs than less gas being used in more fuel efficient cars the purchasing power of the gas taxes now sixty four percent less than it was it Nineteen Ninety three\nIllinois transportation secretary Randy blanket horn says that stagnant federal gas tax means less money to fix and improve his state's highways bridges in transit systems\nWere losing revenue every day just because of inflation without new federal money the cap of what we can do is there we are right now simply maintaining what we have\nSo Kevin ... the national conference of state legislatures says while Congress won't raise the federal gas tax states are taking action themselves\nThe last five years we've seen many states more than half of them actually enact legislation to increase funding for transportation\nTheir own motor fuel taxes Missouri joined them next month the voters approve of ten cents a gallon gas tax hike at Colorado voters are being asked to raise the sales tax to boost transportation funding and many states are also now indexing the gas tax to inflation so it'll go up as construction costs rise\nSome states are also trying alternatives to the gas tax like mileage based user fees that will tax electric cars that also where down roads but don't use gas\nStaying with that Groundhog Day theme Congress does hold hearings from time to time out ways to hike federal funding for transportation but there's almost never vote ears Nevada congresswoman Dena Titus at one such hearing almost two years ago\nWere having the same conversation that same rhetoric named to fix the anthem structure we need to look at the answer is just a matter of paying for it but there's no substance to
