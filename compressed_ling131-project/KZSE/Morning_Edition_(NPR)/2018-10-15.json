I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep when Britain voted on Brexit in two thousand sixteen advocates for that change said there was no downside\nThe u._k. would withdraw from the European Union but the British economy was so big so vital that Europeans would easily negotiate great terms of trade with the British that's what breakfast advocates said that now as prime minister Theresa May prepares to meet European leaders this week with time running out\nThere is a risk of no trade deal at all NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering this story in London either Frank good morning Steve how has this story evolving what's\nGoing very well you know uh basically there were talks over the weekend I'm Dominic raw these the breakfast secretary he flew to Brussels\nAnd couldn't come up with a deal and they're supposed to the prime minister may supposed to fly to Brussels on Wednesday with the hope of kind of working this out but it's not going very well and as you discussed many times before the big sticking point which was never discussed during that referendum you mentioned\nIs the future of a a border across an eye on the island of Ireland and neither side wants to see a new border um but there's a great concern that that could happen and they can't agree on how to work it\nLike to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with the EU for a limited time the doesn't want that they're afraid they want a guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks\nAre a stalemate ah so what they've gotten to is some way to somewhat extend free trade between Britain and the European\nUnion exactly what they're really doing Steve is frankly honestly kicking the can down the road because this is such a difficult\nProblem to solve all though you also noted that even that proposal or is not something the Europeans are legal too eager to grab onto\nNo they're not and actually here's the big problem for prime minister may even many members of a party don't like the idea either if you go back to what you're talking about earlier breakfast ears they sold this to people in the United kingdom as it was going to be a brave new trading future for the United kingdom they were going to cut all these new deals with new with other countries like the United states\nIn fact if they stay inside a customs arrangement for a long time that actually would tie their hands they say\nThey would be still tethered to the European Union and they wouldn't be able to cut these new deals that they say and they insist would be really good for the u._k. economy\nWell are there Brexit fears then saying okay fine great let's just walk away from the European Union with no agreement at all which means we end up with a hard border in Ireland and no real relationship with the Europeans everything has to be started over from scratch their our breakfast\nYears who say that to an end even prime minister may has said in the past\nUh no ... no deal is better than a bad deal and what's happening is we're running out of time here it is possible that there could be other negotiations in November and December but I think the European Union's patience is running\nA and the difficulty for prime minister may is even if she can get a deal with the European Union could you get it through her own parliament is going to be a cabinet meeting tomorrow where it's going to be probably pretty fractious and there's a there's a rising risk if there would be no ... no deal between the two um and what that would mean certainly to the u._k. economy many economists\nSupport comes
