travel the world and climbed the hardest in most exotic rock\nIn two thousand north bay sponsored the for them to climb in the minds of Kurdistan to scale the famous yellow\n\nThis location in Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year and a destination yes\n[noise] [noise] the climbers we're used to massive peaks and dangerous clip faces but still as their helicopter descended into the care of the valley and the yellow wall came into view they were blown away\nSort of walk across this logging get across the\nAnd Abdul came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand employ them up in the rock and he was terrified and his rocking laws\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard\nAnd I didn't even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get off that ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle and I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute\nAnd I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and his patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the sub shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and have tried to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they praying they mind their own business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nThat John but we were all going to go to this other place\nAnd they were going to talk this hour and then we're all going to go home\nThey kept his plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living with skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned a job that you know at least one of these guys going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember best and myself were pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into\nTheir own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though we are seeing them murders somebody I very much\nSaw them as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have a very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and ... and my little tiny\nDisturbing you know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy and to fight his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker raw and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain and one of their captors bear split on now is only two characters with guns to for climbers they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time [noise] um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was\nAnd you start imagining and exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we took gases and it turns out and then five minutes and I think that's probably one Tommy change completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering and you know our chief were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they get off the communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nDo seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys his Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food\nOld and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of set in a weird way we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and and obviously mess that he had fought the story that I spend a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in begged him to know [noise]\nServed pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out the he has this look like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was four to one\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere was just as ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to guns and the anger named a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids as I completely changes everything\nThis was a very early climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\nUm\nCommunicated to each other that it was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of\nMoving up the mountain together\nProgramming is

killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and were racing\nTo class and it just\nSort of scrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm but as I was reaching out to grab his gun strapped the sense what was going to happen\nAnd he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping a poll as hard as I could and he just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of what the sparks through them in like an eternity and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down in ... he hit the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let out this really horrible uh cracking sound because really loud
