Saturn says dot com you lose you like to walk and\nIt's it's nerve wracking it's a it's a hard position they get to as a journalist color um to get a job at a at a prominent publication particularly in print in this country and so\nIt's not a decision to be made lightly you know I I'm not an incredibly wealthy person so that the the last paycheck is going to be felt but I I mean ultimately I didn't think that I was really making any sort of difference in the area that is the most important to me and if and if that was the case then what was the point of staying on\nThe road in this article when I brought to the news room did not matter\nYeah that was the feeling that I had and then I think other journalists of color have that you know we have these experiences and these insights that we've been to the table but we don't feel you know seen or or hurt or or or understood perhaps and that can be a real struggle\nAnd I'm Glad I mean this is something you you walk now do your job because it just burned you so much that this was the case and so we have what have you heard what are you hearing some other journalists of color about your experience the globe\nYeah ... I published a piece on Monday I heard from dozens of journalists of color wrote a vast\nMajority of whom work in this country and they shared the same experiences of not feeling as though the representative and not feeling as though their voices are valued and and you know some people have left\nJobs over at some people have taken on different roles just we don't have to write and so you know what I've heard is that the struggle is is a lot more widespread for journalists of color then people might might recognize\nEvoked as a journalist to ten years and you write in this piece\nSupport comes from Saturn system software engineering providing custom project work staffing and support services for over twenty five years with a team of developers based entirely in Minnesota offshore to the north shore with Saturn systems more at Saturn says dot com\nThem to to report on what they see as important and you know you elevate them to show the power prominent so there are people of color higher up in the chain who catch happiness stories and I had to help with their framing and I just think that the solutions are are fairly obvious\nThat what do you think's last with your departure I mean at some level you thinking well maybe I should stay and fight the good fight and that if you leave then you know you just once you have people of color in unions and\nYeah I mean I think that's sort of part of the struggle if you leave you feel like you're letting other people of color down and that's one less voice to fight for you know the issue that you've you as as important but\nI think for me mentally I felt I wasn't really providing that much help anyway and that my efforts have been sort of few tile and so it was probably time to go but I did I didn't make that decision lightly\nSunny relieve a day she had speaking with you thank you thank you\nSunny Dylan recently quit his job as a reporter at the globe and mail we reach Mr doing today in Vancouver we did request a response from the globe we did not receive that response before we went to air but you'll find more on this story on our website CBC don't see a ... a I H\nMm\nMm\nMm\n\nWhat if somebody took your average paperback and shrink it to roughly one quarter of its size and then turned it linked ... made the words read horizontally so you can flip the pages up instead of left or right or left to right\nSupport for NPR's brought you by the law firm of Inskeep intellectual property group with offices in Minnesota and Los Angeles Inskeep ... group aims to help companies leverage the power of patents to protect their innovation you didn't find out more Inskeep law dot\nCom mobiles by John Green Julie Strauss ... is the president and the publisher of books for young readers we reached ms Strauss cable in New York City\nThis just gave oh what's it like for you the first time you have to have one of these flip back in your hands\nOr they were pretty much a revelation to hold in your hand or you can explain then described them as we've been trying for a long time but when you really hold one there is just a perfect balance of design and mechanics and they feel like something really special when you see them for the first time\nI have to say when I haven't had one in my hand because I just saw the images today but it looks like something whose time has come we should have come a long time ago\nWe hope so well and they have been doing this amazing ... and the Netherlands for so many years and they've been introduced in various countries in Europe but really in in their home countries where they've done the best\nAnd it it really is the ... to me that they haven't made their way over to North America yet but I'm delighted to to bring them here and they they really are sort of an answer to a question I think a lot of print readers have in terms of\nSupport ability that were used to in our lifestyle but with the luxury of print that so many of our readers we know prefer\nJust to I Know it's hard to do because you do you see them you can't have that kind of oh my gosh yeah of course yeah as as best you can you describe what one looks like four hour radio listeners\nThere there are several things that make them really special in terms of construction so\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoors through October and indoor markets open throughout the winter you can visit farmers' markets of M.

bottom horizontal reading of the flaps finding the hinge and this ingenious Lee special nailed paper that's just paper thin but has almost no show through and super sturdy\nUnder that when it's closed it's about the size of a smartphone\nYeah it was almost it is almost the exact same size as my smartphone so in in the case of some phones smaller in fact a little tiny bit sicker but easy to slip into a back pocket or even a front pocket\nSo it really is a pocket book I was wondering why they call them pocket books I never had a positive yes and the text isn't too small\nThe text is not small at all it's not shrunken down really so\nWhen we went into it we broke down the text I worked with my art directors here I'm\nAt ... and we read ... pages of paying attention to lie in town and space saying and the best fonts you could really read it so we worked really hard to be able to have a comfortable reading experience that's the same as almost any print book and the trade\nBut now that the paper it's different because in order to have as many pages as you would for a book you need to use a different type of stationary we would describe that for us\nIt is very similar to and in fact is um it is like five o paper um the publisher the printer that we work with and the Netherlands is history\nThis is an innovation they came up with many years ago um so it does have that same thing paper but they get it from this one single meal and Finland so I Believe where it is reinforced so it really doesn't or if it's quite sturdy um we had a a laundering of one of them in my household\nMy son left one in a pocket\nWhich most folks would not survive and yet came out a little soggy on the other side but the paper was completely attack so they can put up\nWith a lot so they've been used tested they have been used tested they have made it through an adolescent boys laundry\nAnd which is a good thing because you're the first of these books are going to be for young adult readers is that right\nYup we're launching what John Green was for us has back list titles and he is you know his historical young adult author though his readership is very broad and crosses a lot of demographics and one thing we know about young readers and which is across the whole spectrum of people who read our titles is they really love print books\nWe know that they are looking for print titles that are not migrating to eat\nAs some adults have so we know it's something they're looking for\nWhen we know that people would turn to the readers because it had that Compaq nature and that was easy to just carry uses light\nBut then people were then returning to books but again frustrated sort of caught between the two worlds so are you suggesting that this is something that could be the happy compromise between the compact build even a reader and and the the tangible thing of a book\nThat is definitely the hope um it it is definitely true that is not particularly hard to carry around a paperback but the reality is that the ability that you could slip in a pocket or handbag her purse or a tote you know book lovers like to always have a book at their side\nIs there is a perfect for travelling it'll be amazing to me how people use them traveling and we know that that's the way they've worked before so\nAnd what did they found them to do is your imagination cakes and what are the possibilities that those Hollis planet that could be life as we know it could be people that can be animals that could be things I guess\nThat's all sorts of possibilities and the other hand you know you look at this positive thing and you think well this is what could happen but we are always making assumptions and I always I'm afraid of assumptions if you assume\nThat whenever a planets inhabitable zone as small as got water life starts then there should be life throughout our galaxy but then we have a problem with the Fermi paradox right for him he said well there's no life all through the galaxy why hasn't contacted us [laughter] I Know there's\nThere's two aspects you one there's so many planets habitable zone\nThat might have a life\nAnd yet we have heard from none of them so it's a big puzzle that we've uncovered as well\nAnd we tried to contact them I don't think we've done that maybe that's the problem that is right that might be the problem can you just take us back to the day this launched march of two thousand and I what was that like to do that on to what was it like to be there\nWas absolutely marvelous to actually see this big rocket and see the you know our space telescope on top of that that was marvelous and I had an opportunity\nBill and say hey are named while we're ready to fire or you could spend your time with your family watching the launch well away from the launch I spent so much time away from my family building that mission so I said no control room would be a wonderful experience rather be with my family and so my family and I\nAnd some of our colleagues from the measure were sitting there watching this magnificent missile was plume of fire ... going to the sky it was absolutely marvelous I used to talk about how wonderful that was that night was the most exciting night at my life\nAnd to my wife said no it was the second most exciting night in your life\nYou were there for the most exciting that was ... I Would not you got married\nHowever you interpret [laughter]\nWould you win which is all the years and people said you know ... ... you had a lot of pushback and and you you resisted you people now in credit you with having done that if you hadn't been so resistant wouldn't be there\nYes we ... we proposed five different times you know only the fifth proposal was accepted and it takes a tremendous amount of work and I'm from a lot of people to put together a spacecraft proposal Carl Sagan was one of our members our team members I don't know if you remember Carl Sagan of\nCourse and every time we would fail I Would ask all the team members do you want to try again and I had a letter from Carl Sagan yes yes I Want to try again I think it's a great mission and I'll be feeling better soon\nA few months later yeah I have a letter on my wall\nSo the Kepler telescope is now retired and I understand the NASA's project called taps his launch this is the satellite is going to be watching those dies\nIt's actually on orbit it's actually sending data back down and they've already\nA nice thing about tennis Kepler was a discovery class mission\nIt was a probe into the galaxy\nOur plan is common or rare earth comedy or rare just give us those numbers so we can build a new mission which is what kept her did now test comes along and says let's look at the whole sky\nAnd find the closest planet to start the planets really the closest stars and so we can examine them\nWith a James Webb telescope and we can examine them with ground based telescopes the new big telescopes coming online and find out more about these individual planets so that's the next step in our exploration of our galaxy\n... appreciate speaking with you thank you\nYou're most welcome by

assisted evolution and what that really means is accelerate seeing what nature does\nI'm On a longer time frame and attempting to do that in a shorter timeframe and there'll be a thing to do that is that the climate is changing much more quickly than coal can keep up with so\nWe do that really through using things like selective breeding when we will will identify the most recently in total

reduce the diversity of those girls are the ones that aren't strong and can't adapt to these conditions that we trust upon them aren't going to survive\nWell and if we do nothing that's exactly what the outcome will be and I think that that says with a pulling back from the context of our work we've observed and we continue to observe the death of colleague sitting Nineteen Ninety eight\nFend off
