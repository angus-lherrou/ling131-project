anywhere\nSo none of these last night of allegations have been corroborated as is confirmed by the seventh and latest FBI investigation fishermen Grassley side of this morning new to the Judiciary Committee\nOr the FBI could located in a third parties who can attest to any of these allegations\nIs Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell speaking earlier today Senate Democrats had a very different take here as Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nWe had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts having received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized [noise]\nThis visit he had to know that his fiance did indeed say that he was worried about going to the conflict but that he had received assurances from his diplomatic friends that he would be fine I'm with going\nAnd his fiance was waiting for him outside is that right\nCorrect waiting for him outside um he had given her several numbers to call if he did not come out again indicating that he was a little nervous about going to the conflict in the first place and then uh he did not come out\nWhat did she do how long did you stay there\nSo she said it for several hours after the conflict had close even\nUm and even the next day he went back and went back with a number of other journalists to a demand has release my understanding is that um she is a not well over the situation\nBut again and there are there have been reports of of journalists that have been gathering particularly the Turkish Arab journalists coalition that is gathering to\nUm to pressure and and demand answers basically\nIs there any chance that he could have left and she didn't know about it\nUm I I'm sure that is what is that is when what's on all of our minds right now obviously I'm the Saudi authorities are maintaining that he left the conflicts and uh the latest statement and saying that they're cooperating with Turkish authorities\nTo try to find him on the Turkish official position from the presidential spokesperson is that\nThey have reason to believe that he is still there\nAs with all constantly to the local authorities who provide the police forces or the ... the country to the ... the the host country Turkish police who are on the security that the consulate they say they've checked to security cameras and did not see Mr ...\nLeave the building on foot but they do say that a number\nNo the consulate since Tuesday so is that where your concerns lie\nI'm sure I think there's that and then there are just the concerns that frankly that we're hearing very very different and reflecting theories and explanations from the Saudis and the Turkish authorities\nStem from our efforts at the at the post you know we really we've reached out to both um Saudi and Turkish authorities so we hope that uh the Turks can\nPressure there Saturday counterparts for information for answers I'm I'm sure in an ideal

P. L. S. dot org for market times in locations\nIt is it is really you know quite stunning I'm quite studying to see what's been happening in the kingdom in general just sitting there and tolerance for dissent and could make Jamal the target absolutely\nAs you point out he was formerly he was an advisor to the royal family so what what ... what changed and why why was he why didn't he turned against this particular regime\nSo and it has the very first piece that I I commissioned and edited for him last September\nUm the title was that in Saudi Arabia and you know was always repressive now it's becoming unbearable um you basically just saw a lot of his friends getting swept up in the crackdown seesaw friends I'm being imprisoned or having traveled lands uh slapped on them\nAnd uh the time you know he he wrote hound that area we deserve better than this and this is again a kingdom that is showing even under this new conference total and tolerance for any sort of dissent or or criticism of their policy\nWe know what it is Mohammed bin Salman has consolidated his power he has as you pointed out arrested\nHundreds of Clara exact with his business people numbers of them were detained outside the country what became of them is there any record of people getting released is there is there a pattern that you might be able to give you hope to Janelle ... my my ... emerge from this if he is being detained by the sound\nUm that's that's the difficult part time and again we know we know of activists sand and journalists and social media stars that have been held for months a year even\nCharged with anything so yes I'm very worried but again if a hopeful that keeping a spotlight on his name and on this case both here and the U.S and abroad can it can help for speedy resolution

competition in arm wrestling\nAbout Fifteen Years old actually\n[laughter] how does that come about my dad and I well and my mom we were invited on this um was Alan hit man for he was doing a fundraiser for himself and he said I Will give off camera whoever can beat me\nAnd it's like well free camera right so we went in and my dad one the camera and they offered by parents to go and train with them\nBut they didn't really know much about myself but I wanted to give it a shot so my dad got me into the practice and they saw a lot of potential and they're like you know at Fifteen Years old and your poll in this much you ought to continue with this\nWhat did you think about when they told her that\nIt really was um something huge for me I never really had something as big as this for someone to actually take initiative and me\n\nSee her dad liberal cabinet minister bill Blair and yesterday he said that once marijuana is legalized ... as you mentioned October seventeenth he said that the liberal government will address this issue of criminal records in quotes and appropriate way\nAnd we heard that Ralph Goodell a public safety ms minister while ago he said the government would look\nTo ways to make things fair so what does all that that that did you think the liberals are supporting your private members bill\nWe're going to find out because I intend to ask them on October seventeenth but honestly I Do hope they do and this is not a partisan issue I think if they characterize it as I Do as a justice issue I'm hopeful they'll they'll do it I think they could have done and should have done when they introduced the kind\nOf a spill in the first place California brought in similar measures Vermont that but I get that they're not saying let's wait until the bill comes into force\nAnd so I'm trying to use this private members bill ... as an effort to kind of nudge them to do the right thing I'm hopefully will\nBut if it seems likely that they are going to do what you're proposing then why not just wait for that why why make this noise now has likely just going to evolve in that direction anyways\nMaybe you're more optimistic than I Am certainly talked about this and vague terms I Want to commit them to build this bill is gone through several drops with the same kind of legislative draft or who have worked for the government and I'm hoping they'll say this is it if they want to tweak it if they want to uproot\nBut I Do not want this to simply linger it seems to me an issue that needs to be addressed because we're imposing burdens on hundreds of thousands of Canadians that simply should not have them going forward\nAs we recall that Stephen Harper government imposed a mandatory minimum sentences and six months\nFor uh any pot possession of six plants or less a which I understand the number of people were affected by that we spoke with Jillian than you know that just while ago who is a minister in that cabinet too was supported those mandatory minimum sentences he's now\nIn the business he says that pot is a wonderful therapy for people and it's a great business opportunity what do you say to those who supported this in the past and now see it as an opportunity for them\nWell I'm not going to comment on business decisions that they made and what some would see as a slightly hypocritical position\nI understand that what you're suggesting but truly this has to be something that the liberals and conservatives support this is something that we should all pass ideally by unanimous resolution if possible so we can write this injustice going forward\nDo you think that conservatives will support you Bill\nYou know I've talked to a couple of the mind the co chair of the justice committee you start dealing with the right people and uh I've talked to one so far and I hope that they will I think they get the basic point about the injustice and\nI'm hoping like me that they see that society has changed and the things that might have been\nTreated one way back twenty Thirty years ago is treated in a very different way today we've seen that all over the place in other areas same sex activity there was an expungement
