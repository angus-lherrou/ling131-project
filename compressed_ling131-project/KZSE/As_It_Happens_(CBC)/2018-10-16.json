I Know that that's it well I'm hanging in London Cape Breton that's pretty big because some of that so that when I went that's something that people often say\nOh no no like gets editorial caught ah for for me I blame the CBC I blame a crutch ... such as normal I use oil but um oh yeah it's it's a it's a slight the column in the ER and he was quite sour about it and I really did oh the lawn and apology and I did do a hotel ...\nWhy did you decide to issue this apology to the ministers who a letter to the editor\nAll politicians read the letters to the editor and our might cut malaria might put something on Facebook now the only way I got a real true apologies wrecked by about ... on a lottery today are always read those\nAnd you should mention McCauley reads the guardian\nOr asked if he was one of his staffers did and I'm I'm sure they have all you got back to learn a lot worried about it\nAnd it's going to read part of what you wrote says dear Lawrence collie and prefer current again and federal minister of agriculture I Would like to formally apologize to you for calling you in last friday at the hall in pools corner have you had a response from yeah well\nI'm sure I'll run into him something he has a small price on a just a matter of time I mean and you always running of the people you're trying to avoid around ...\n... ... ... ... you think that he didn't acknowledge the apology did he accept your apology\nOn those problems in the front or almost rather ultra yeah could be a front man for further on those terrible agriculture deal I don't think he got enough problems or gets related\nI bet you did go on and there's no they didn't you you didn't stop there you said that ah you said he should tender his resignation and come home to PE I and then you said please don't be remembered as the jerk that destroyed the dairy industry so now you tell them he's going to be a jerk if he doesn't resign\nWell all all of them I don't want him to be remembered as a joke I didn't actually following a joke\nBut says he doesn't do what you say you should do which is ... resigned come home that he is a jerk\nAll outlaw both\nJust one other thing about a year relationship with as it happens you you uh\nDo just write letters to the editor you sent a selfie with your cows we we got that just last month and a you're adding to our fiftieth anniversary\nOf being on the air we ask people to send us where they listen to the show and you wrote on your tweet never miss as it happens it's been on in the milking parlor all my life meet my boy Oliver and twenty cows all becoming informed\nIs how would the cows feel about hearing you on as it happens tonight\nOh store I'm hoping some down on ... on the lips up a lot of the city he pulled up on the whole ...\nWhat we wanted to do is use 'em at does and and a system of ah using vaporize or is it that would be safe and that we could control well in terms of the bills that would\nIn a joint you can have different doses so we wanted to control that part of the study as much as possible\nAnd I know the CIA funded study and they did some polling where they found that one in five young Canadians believe that they are as good or even better when they drive when they're under the influence of what do you make of that\n[noise] it's interesting because in in our study what we did ask them at different times ... also how they felt about their driving safety and the majority of our participants um didn't feel that they would be safe drivers and even after five hours\nThe they have some self awareness\nAbility and that's interesting when we're thinking about maybe going through with uh some self awareness campaigns\nSo you didn't have it goes one in five young to know the other more no but also they were they're aware that there is a test and so they're probably being more reflective ... on their my state\nYeah it might be the case you're right uh that they may be more reflective because they're in a study about driving and and and the use of Kennedy's so again I'm thinking forward in terms of public awareness campaigns and if we can\nIf they can be targeted to sensitized uh the public and the young drivers I think that's an interesting way one interesting way to go\nGiven your research given what you found out what what would what would you advise and the way of trying to teach young people about marijuana and driving\nI think that the button ... messages that if you are under the influence of Kennedy's if you smoke or inhale you shouldn't be driving and you should wait a long enough\nI mean you're driving in our case even after five hours a day or ... he was still impaired so uh you need to uh wait to significant amount of time before taking them to wheel again\nYou were looking at Eighteen to twenty four year old and then you I Know you were interested in knowing how senior citizens who might be interested in marijuana for medicinal reasons as well as recreational I mean that are you looking to do similar studies like this\nI there are many still didn't need it but there are other groups that we didn't look at in our study so as you were mentioning a older I'm drivers who are using a candidate for additional reason\nA daily users of Kennedy's um these are all different groups and I don't know that we can extrapolate our result to these other groups where the impact or the influence of Kennedy's Manhattan different effect\nAlright well very very interesting information during this historic weeks that we are in the midst of the rest of the other no thank you it was a pleasure thank you\n[noise] that was professor is about ... from the school of physical and occupational therapy at McGill University we reached her in

the job this summer as what was once widespread support for the liberals carbon pricing plan\nBegan to implode and the Trudeau government has put the plan at the center of its commitment to combat climate change but Ontario Manitoba ... and ... are all now oppose we reached inter governmental affairs minister Dominique live now in Ottawa\nMinister that you had a broad provincial support for your carbon pricing plan was ambitious than they were on side now you have ... would be premieres lining up to fight to even to take you to court what went wrong\nBut so Carol from our perspective um we have been consistent with Canadians uh and with our international and global partners that Canada must take urgent action to face the real challenges of climate change we campaigned on that and twenty Fifteen\nAs you noted are referred to in twenty sixteen the provinces a ball signed a framework agreement which spoke about a number of measures\nAnd some provincial elections have created circumstances where different governments are now saying that they want to take a different approach we've also said publicly that our provincial election doesn't actually constitute or climate change plan\nAnd we have to all Canadians and we've told internationally international community that Canada was going to take robust as serious action\nWe're continuing towards the commitment we made around for example putting a price on pollution making polluters pay to get back to what you just said\nIntact you have ... years and opinions Ontario I Do want to be premier of Alberta who quite possibly will be ... who I not just opposing you taking a different tack they are campaigning\nBy fighting the carbon tax they are putting a rallies come and fight the carbon tax they're raising funds for their campaigns on the back of saying we're going to tear up this carbon tax idea so it's not just a little bit of push back you have a full scale wind coming toward you\nSo ah again if some conservative leaders are conservative ... want to run campaigns on particular issues they can explain to their citizens and be accountable for those campaign decisions I don't\nOr purport to understand or or speak for the campaign strategy of different conservative leaders across the country but if conservative leaders and in this case Andrew sheer federally does not have any semblance or any coherent plans to meet the challenges of climate change\nOr telling Canadians we do and and provincial premier can organize\nRallies if they want and say what they want it those partisan rallies what we're focused on a is bringing forward a very clear and robust plan to tackle the serious challenge of climate change which Canadians see in their daily lives is very real\nWe saw like heroin New Brunswick with the historic floods last spring the wildfires in British Columbia the tornados that hit auto and gotten a few weeks ago so Canadians notice Israel and they expect their government to take coherent and concerted action\nThan we have said that we will we are prepared to do that in the case of provinces that decide not to be partners we have a federal plan including a price on pollution which will come into effect on January first and we will then be in a position to give the money back to Canadians\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

R. go dot com\nIs it entirely their fault that people are buying into it that or is it the fact that possibly you're a liberal government the federal government has failed to make it clear to Canadians why you think it's necessary\nSo again that the job killing taxes that was a phrase Mr Harper used to use all the time in the house of commons I remember that when we were sitting in the corner in third place he used to accuse the liberals are having all these job killing tax secret plans\nAnd Canadians took us from from third place to first place with a majority government and implementing a price on pollution and coming up with a robust serious plan that deals with the real challenge of climate change is a commitment we made the Canadians and it's something that our government\nIs very serious about uh about putting in place and as I say I think we need to be careful if there were Thirteen premier of provinces and territories across the country just because one or two or three find a megaphone and go to a rally we shouldn't\nCross infect other jurisdictions that are working constructively and positively with us on a on these issues\nBut it's not just a few ... is is that you've got for clean is against you and you've got Ontario there's got to on prince Edward island plus now Manitoba I buy in Palestine just a month ago Justin today was celebrating him as the conservatives who gets it\nAnd then you've got Alberto gays and Kenny could take over next that's not just a few years more than half the Canadian population\nBut again I admit Jason Kidd he has to be careful not to assume the job of premier until he wins it in an elections", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "16"}
