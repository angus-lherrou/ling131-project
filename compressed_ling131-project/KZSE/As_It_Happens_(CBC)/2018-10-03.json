I'm I'm a big fan of movie I gave it Meyer who was the last one and um [noise] aside if it hadn't occurred to me that they hadn't\nOnly one before that was ... ... yes of course so\nI can really be it shouldn't be lined up with those two incredible women but anyway\nWell you are as a rule of\nBut you know it's interesting that we we spoke last month with astrophysicist adjustment Bel Bruno and she told us about being overlooked for a Nobel Prize she was she was one of the well a group of men and she was the only woman and they had developed this research and posters the men won the Nobel\nAnd she said to be when the press came to ask questions they asked the men about the science and they asked her\nAbout her measurements and her bra size and don't have any boyfriends this was in the late Nineteen sixty she was a scientist at that point did you ... did you experience sexism and in science in the course of your career\nNot blatantly no I mean you know along the way you know I I've been told by you know men that did better that you know I've never been bitten by a girl or you know how could a girl get that kind of mark you know that kind of silly thing but I just always think it's silly when they say\nWell you must have heard the Italian prevented I was ... and at the certain conference\nI missed that I should find time to listen to it because I've been asked to comment on it\nYou should listen he said that this was invented by men and built by men and becoming a ... and that was turning against the men who invented it so this is your profession\nI see it and he just forgot to think of vote Marie Curie um you know I mean the fact of history that you know men did go to work and women stayed at home until there were more men you know that's just that's just a fact I'm but obviously once you've never you know obviously there's people that are making contributions and they should all be recognized\nAs talking about what you should be recognized where we're just tripped pulse\nA woman's terms\nIt's the fact that ah at the time when we were doing this work you could have short pulse lasers or you could have high energy lasers but you couldn't have shortfalls and high energy because of that peak power which you want in order to maybe blow up an Adam and strip the electrons right off the item or molecule\nUm if you did it if you ran a short pulse through your amplifier you would them blow up your amplifier\nAnd so this is why it didn't happen and so what tripped pulse amplification did and it's a very simple concept is the fact that we realize no you have to ... to the polls first which means you stretch the pulse to be many orders of magnitude longer than you can go had an amplifier because now it just seems like a long pole to the amplifier nothing happens to the amplifier\nAnd after that then you can ... it also does not destroy the um stretch that you put on it it maintains it and so you can go ahead and compress it back to the way it was except with all the energy and and now it's ready for the experiment\nBut that but that didn't layman's terms that's really how to get the shortfalls and high energy for the experiment but not inside the laser\nHas dramatically increased intensity of that post them that's right what what is it they will to do now that you were able to you did you accomplish that what what would a applications is that\n[noise] well of course many of applications for scientific right so this is why we started to study just how molecules and atoms are ionized under the ... the fields in a bigger than what's holding the electrons to the Adams inside the laser field and so this was a new sort of paradigm to work and\nIt was a very few years after it was invented that somebody actually commercialized a CPA laser for eye surgery\nThis is you know millions of people have had correct the laser eye surgeries\nBut they don't all have to they don't want to use this but millions house yes it is a huge is probably the number one application still\nWill come on you must be very proud of that yeah I mean and that's why I found that amazing that\nIt happened and that yes\nAnd it's made a difference in so many lives that's what\nYou called you know what I can only do that no I Know that you would pave the way this side of the way then the question I had to be made I made it possible yes and ... and there's also a lot being made on Twitter that uh you know about winning scientist is an associate professor at water so when I heard about I'm\nI'm very sorry I did I think the anniversary it's been criticized for that but I just something that for like\nYou know nobody told me not to nobody you know actually I have colleagues male colleagues here called me I should you know it was\nTime for me to be applying and I said I'll get around to that but I just never did begin to get around to it now\nI don't know my I kind of hoping maybe they never she's lifting they'll just give it to me now [laughter] I don't know I guess if they have a lot of flak they'll they'll maybe helped me fill out all the forms that has to be filled it\nBut I think Nobel winning scientist or is that you probably a good enough reason to have an age of ... and ...\nI I just like to do things that are ... they're not going to say I never found fun so that's why I didn't do\nThe measure strictly again big congratulations to you so much thanks just speaking with us\nBy by by\nWe reached associate professor Dona Strickland in Waterloo, Ontario she won the Nobel Prize in physics today and that was colonel mentioned in my conversation they're professors strict ones Nobel comes on the heels of\nControversial comments by Italian scientist on his son through ... through ... young enough to research organization CERN\nOn friday a ... spoke at a seminar about gender issues in physics\nHe claimed as colonel said the physics was quote invented and built by men it's not by invitation unquote he also said males scientists were being discriminated against because of ideology rather than merit\nWas immediately suspended for his quote unacceptable remarks just Wade is a physicist from imperial college London she attended that seminar we reached has weighed in London\nThis weird what was the most offensive thing you are listening to professor ... speaking the other day\nI think that nice defense as part of the tokens to say that physics was invented by ... by the Haitian\nWhen actually within has contributed huge need to physics throughout the whole of history\nBut for an incredibly long time we haven't documented auto stories and we have to be ready castle ... reactor men but that it was I Need midway through the last three that women were even able to graduate from ready prestigious universities like Harvard or Cambridge and so that kind of huge impact on physics is only just beginning to happen now\nThis wasn't just some off the cuff remark that this professor made and that question period this was he gave a series of slides discussing ... can you describe some of the some of the presentation he gave I Know you were in the room for that\nThat presentation had obviously had a lot of time taken over it and he had done a bake analysis of lots of publications and looked at the track record of men and women comparing that kind of time throughout that Korea and showing the at the beginning of ... they have some a number of citations for different publications\nAnd then afterwards is deviated changed the men had most citations\nAnd ... huge number of programs and the whole way of academic publishing at the moment that's a big bias against women and also against non western people in the fast very I'd be stages of pair of you\nAnd then after that that is by an ... site and you basically when you're writing out to find the paper you cite 'til you reference the people that you know the people that you're familiar with the people that you say conferences\nAnd more often than not with men men and they fight men more often that she will say site themselves way more often than they\nCouples sugar from your neighbor I mean so that's really what we're talking about we're talking about being able to live together being able to function and work within our province so it's I think a lot of people\nHave a vested interest in throwing a you know random accusations that us I don't think it was entirely accurate to do so\nOkay but not just defense language test a values task to immigrants and that's ... beat and being deportation failed that test that's\nActually the parental government doesn't have the power to deport so we\nNever asked a federal government to do it for you but we actually\nYou know we never said that we would ask the federal government to do that the reality is what we were proposing is that [noise] and it's just something that exist you've been there in Canada that people who immigrate here are off to adhere to Canadian values in general and that's the only thing that we were suggesting so\nWe're not doing anything more or less than what the federal government's doing on its\nOwn and they know where where where is there a test in a rousing had if your values Canadian values telling me when that happens\nImmigrants that want to come to Quebec are off a series of questions about how life occurs everyday in Canada and our our position is very similar to that and we're asking them to adhere to basic values of\nOf Canada whether or not it's a quality of the sexes um you know a\nSame sex marriage rights very basic things I think anybody who wants to come to Canada should know that this is a place that welcomes diversity and that's basically what the question I wouldn't do and anybody who uh wouldn't hypothetically past that I think that would be extremely rare considering\nAnybody who wants to come here is manifestly wants to integrate within our society\nAt that point we would simply say that we don't we won't admit the credential that's required ... at that point a could could walk through a limit welcome them anywhere and of course the charter\nWith that position and I don't find that the street and I don't think that we're anywhere near deporting and I think it's you know I don't think it's accurate to say that we could do that because provincial governments don't have the power\nTo the ... just to make the declassified this what we've heard some seek you is it there would be and this past would happen several years after they allowed to see how can the degree to which they've integrated learn languages that not too\nSlowly ... that were very welcoming to immigrants and we want them to succeed him are going to be very flexible\nAnd the way that we in dispel the construction certificates and of course right now we're in the process of forming are cabinet the premier olack is looking at you forming a his team and I think you know the new immigration minister is going to have the responsibility of clarifying exact rules but I mean I don't think that now is a good time to get into the detail as\nTo what that would look like the future immigration minister is going to consult with your crops within the immigration department consult with our federal partners to make sure that we have some good but to be cleared the wants integration to seek to wants immigrants to succeed\nAnd we want throw more money at making sure that they do succeed so actually I think our position is very open minded and I think it's going to look what records or\nWithout wearing religious symbols what restrictions will they be understanding the party would not want people in in the public service teachers to be wearing a overt religious symbols is not the case\nSo we ... we support a recent recommendation that was called the shark Hitler commission\nThe books are killer commission was a commission that occurred ten years ago within that report it was determined that the best way to proceed would be to prohibit overt religious symbols in positions of authority so anybody who was in a position to exercise the power of the state would be required\nTo or not wear overt religious symbols and see a cue believes that teachers in primary and high school are authority figures\nWould that religious neutrality law is already the subject of a constitutional challenge and so you see a cue going to go further than that religious needs holiday huh\nThe speculate as to what we may or may not do with something that's there could be part of the courts\nWould that I can also be those religious symbols it includes people who end crucifix is\nAnything that would be overt and religiously significant would be something that would be covered by the shark Hitler commission\nThis is an election for the first time in years and that that was not focused on time and he said what does that tell you about what could that could see themselves in ...\nI think it tells us that we finally moved on and I think that's a great thing you know for me uh I've been stuck in a in a in a world where we have two choices that I had a party that wants to stay within Canada and I had one wants to separate from Canada and if you had a you know if you had going for one side or the other\nYou were stuck there for forever if you offer people at different choice and I'm very happy\nThat they must
