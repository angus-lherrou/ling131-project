... of a you know this woman in Russia actually as a\nIn preparation for the country I just opened Google and I and I rode viral spreading video I just wanted to see which which article that are going to be first and actually you can still see\nThat the majority of the articles into Google Search or remain the the video that don't know that it's it's actually a stage of staged protests are fake process so that's actually quite interesting\nHow do you know it said ... what would what was the evidence that was presented to say that this was a fake story and that this man's betting thing was just staged\nI first watched it was really strange is that the female blogger in individual the female blogger that's talking about this and that staging this a protest or has been known in Russia to do this in the past but unlike this uh particular video she has\nBrought a serious issue is like a you know ups courting and other forms of sexual assault that women in Russia tempt fate and what what struck me about this video is that the tone was very different and it was almost aggressive and the way that she was approaching so called men\nSpreading a people on on the subway and it it just seemed a little bit off and how she was trying to prove a point about an issue like men sprinting which was an entirely different ballpark to ups courting once the article on the eve this information side came out the evidence that they give\nFor being fake it that he was actually published by a an outlet that's owned by Russia\nBut that's directly owned by the Kremlin or the outlet it's called into now which used to be a show on the arts website which is now its own sort of vertical and it's quite popular on Facebook that's where the the video that when most viral was posted and that's that video actually still is online\nAre there are other versions of the video that were posted on YouTube where have not been taken down but the original video or Facebook video is actually still on Facebook and I think at the time that I checked it had like six million views\nI wasn't do part of the debunking that uh the men who are in it because if people haven't seen the video\nMen are sitting man's spending on a subway the legs are a part she's next to them or standing above them she pours this liquid into their lap say look startled looks at how did we come to know that these were actors who are paid\nThere's there's an online magazine in ... in St Petersburg called ... and uh they posted some interviews with one of the men who appeared in the video\nWho said that he was actually page and subsequently other other testimonies of people of men into video were posted online on social media saying uh you know the day appeared in the video and they were a couple of paid actors and I think the exact posts was you know you ... you come in for a job with with her parents and you and you leave with money in your pocket\nUm and then what you know once once to sort of the investigation got a little bit deeper it turned out that potentially get this video was filmed by um\nBy a studio that that are known to have worked with Archie and with the Kremlin end up in the past so the connections become you know more and more clear that the deeper you look\nWhy would this be of interest as Kremlin propaganda why what what's why why this sounds like a a not a large issue for the state government why why would they they've helped to fund something like this\nIt's one of it it's it's sort of like one of many uh\nFor a debate and and and sort of their anger and the reason why we're talking about it's just they got caught and that's the thing that I think is different now than\nLet's say two or three years ago and uh what the video was basically trying to do is is trying to show how a woman is you know is going too far she's being aggressive in in sort of protecting her so cold you know in in quotation marks or her feminist sort of a lot to see in in ...\nThat only goal is to is to store I'm On the feminist sentimentality in in in people around the world particularly people and the west but it's also\nYou know once this goes back to Russia you know it allows politicians\nFor example to it's a talking point where they can go back and then sort of\nStarts to pour it into more conservative parts of the country I think there was one politician one uh from from putting his party who said really nasty things about this uh\nActivists in about ten minutes and journals so it allows them to to actually bring back certain points about how important is to keep a conservative society and to how we shouldn't be like misled by liberal or a radical liberal sort of ideas like sending them and things like that\nWhen you said that that when you checked on line to just to now you found that to some sites don't seem to know that at stake but do you think it's more the case that they don't care that they are not talking about mainstream media but I Do think that there is it did to the point now where it doesn't even matter if it's too as long as it's effective\nUm I think I think\nSo I don't know if it ... I don't know if the desired effect is actually achieved I Know that the if the article that to you this from ... uh I added a comment that had fourteen thousand likes as as sort of proof that people are are getting kind of enraged\nBy this set by the staging act and that it that it potentially has started some anti feminist a sentiment but I to be honest I think we shouldn't place too much\nEmphasis on on these kinds of uh\nPlentiful and they exist across continents in in in in Europe and in in the U.S but I don't think\nAre are sort of like a starts worry too much about these guys with them the truth is that the the Kremlin is kind of thing you know different kinds of propaganda a disinformation campaign than it is the sort of a hit or miss rather than a or a central central I sort of a strategy\n[noise] All right we'll leave it there are ... thank you thank you\nGlenn a glove is a reporter and a video producer with a mashable dot com we reached him in London, UK we have more on this story on our website CBC dot CA slash a I H\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nStacey Kennedy spit into a tube and mailed it off to a DNA testing website and when the results return she was beyond ... smacked\nYes she found out she was British Irish and parts Scandinavian which is very cool but you also found out that she had a long lost sister and if that were not shock enough she later found out that that half sister lived a mere two hours drive away we reached D.C Kennedy in Ottawa\nStacey when you were growing up did you have any idea that you had more family members and there\nI had absolutely no idea it was just my brother and I growing up I didn't even have an inkling no idea whatsoever\nWhy did you decide to submit your DNA to this Denise allergy\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...
