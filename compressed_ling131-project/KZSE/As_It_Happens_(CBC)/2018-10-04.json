how\nHe is a quote self made billionaire well a New York times investigation offers a somewhat different perspective it reveals that Mr Trump received four hundred and Thirteen million US dollars from his father's real estate empire\nMost of it because he helped his family dodge taxes [noise] two years ago reporters Suzanne Craig a Canadian was mailed Mr Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax returns\nShe told us he had possibly avoided paying federal taxes for Eighteen years but now the times is reporting and Mr Trump participated\nIn outright fraud we reached Suzanne Craig in New York City\nSince then you put out a trade or what do you up to last night as you waited for this story to be printed in today's paper what did you do\nAfter a after we were finished at work I went out to a depressed New York times press plant in Queens and I watch the uh the story that we wrote roll off the process\nSo we last time we spoke a couple of years ago you received a bomb paper on ... in which you had a part of Donald Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax return and from that you were able to extrapolate a lot of information but since then\nYou have found other streams of documents to describe what you've been up to in the past two years what you have an earth since then\nSure we continue to look at 'em Donald Trump's taxes\nThousand and sixteen where we got three pages of his tax returns right before election day um and we're just continue to push on his fine out says part of that we examined tens of thousands of public documents and we also got access to thousands and thousands of confidential documents for Trump's real estate empire\nYou tend to questions to Donald Trump his lawyer Charles Harder responded that should that time stage or implied that President Trump participated in fraud or tax evasion or any other crime it will expose you to my ability and damages for defamation so I Know the language is careful here and is in the article how would you characterize\nThe charges you're putting out here concerning Donald Trump is family and their families empire\nWell we found in terms of the the the wrong doing we found several instances based on the documents that we looked out where Donald Trump participated in fraudulent talk ski\nIt's getting into some examples of if you are now it just to for instance can we talk about what happened when they do is huge numbers of loans that Donald Trump received from his father had grown to into the millions of dollars how did he covered for those\nDonald Trump has long claimed as part of of this this\nNarrative that he's created for himself you sort of but pretty much up from nothing businessman who made it to the president he's like a self made billionaire and then we found not only did we we uncovered in the documents not only at least sixty one million dollars in loans\nThat uh that Trump extended to Donald Trump cases many of them were repaid we also found that Donald Trump received over ... lifetime more than ... and beyond also as an inheritance more than four hundred million dollars from his father\nSaid Trump being used his father and there's one instance you give that the fed tramp at one point and spent about fifty million dollars to buy a stake in at ... palace\nHis son can you describe that\nSure I think spent Fifteen million would be a generous description of it he Donald Trump owed um his father Fifteen million dollars and not that debt I'm instead of being a you know written off was in fact he used it to invest\nIn the Trump power so he turned the debt into an investment in Trump polish and then it was written down to almost nothing\nYou mentioned companies the old county building supply maintenance can you tell us what that was\nSure that was one of the most intriguing are frauds that that we found it was probably the most kind of ones with the bright lights around it spread Trump was getting older and to his eighties\nHe he'd only not only you know huge number of buildings in the New York area worth hundreds of millions of dollars but he was also sitting on a huge amount of cash and Donald Trump ... siblings realized that\nAt some point he was going to die and not money was going to be subject to a fifty five percent inherited talks to what the Trump ... kids that it's it's pretty incredible for years for Trump would\nYou know for his buildings he would buy everything from fringes in stove and then one day a company called ... county was created and suddenly all county started doing all the buying for fried Trump's\nEmpire they would pay three hundred dollars for new fridge is then they would create a separate receipt and they would mark it up anywhere from twenty to fifty percent and send it up to Fred and the difference on not was pocketed by county which\nWas controlled by Donald Trump and his siblings it ... it allowed them to drain huge amounts millions of dollars in cash from their fathers empire so that it would not be subject to the death tax\nFinally the kind of an overarching a theme of this this investigation is that that Donald Trump is presented is understood to have been a self made man isn't but why does it matter what is that it might way does it fit into your a story about tried as to how\nThat in the solid G\nWell he's he's benefitted greatly over the years from this this law that has been repeated over and over and over and\nI guess just the myth making of him that's been wrong and it's a spectacular caught it was interesting as we were going through the reporting early on in the Nineteen seventies right out you know when he graduates if he goes to work for his father he doesn't interview you know with the New York times and he goes around and he he talks about this job that's his and\nAnd this building that says and he's driving around in a car and he's you know showing this reporter all this stuff it it was incredible every\nEvery building he showed the reporter was his father's even though he claimed it was his own as his life went on\nHe then started to diminish his father's achievements you know he would say only about a million dollar loan my father was a great building but it was in Brooklyn and queens and then when it came time in two thousand and four or five years after ...\nTo sell the empire the biggest single payday in his life in two thousand and four was done very\nQuietly and just finally what was that final payday\nThat year was ... just under two hundred million dollars he got roughly like a hundred and Seventy seven million\nThe empire itself sold for roughly eight hundred million and we found through other records that it should have been valued at roughly a billion so even on that day the man who wrote the art of the deal you know I think got less than a lot less than he probably should have for sale\nExtraordinary Suzanne thank you very much sneaking this okay great thank you Suzanne Craig is the New York times reporter
