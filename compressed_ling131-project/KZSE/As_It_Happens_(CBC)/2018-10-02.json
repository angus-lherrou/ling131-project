to people like to talk of the powerful dairy lobby in Canada were over three so far as powerful\nAs summit Canadian point of view here's what it looks like we were looking at a um a really big dent being put into our manufacturing industry in our trade in an auto uh in in the auto mobiles and auto parts\nAnd what we've traded and also I trade disputes mechanism is a chapter Nineteen that was very important to Canada and in exchange they seem to have given up three point six percent of the Canadian dairy market to us farmers\nThat doesn't seem like it I guess such an awful trained to a lot of Canadians I don't think\nWell I I find it interesting you say that because um that they're not the deal is already in place chaplain Nineteen was already in place so if chapter Nineteen or this or NAFTA panel such an efficient such a great uh\nA thing to have a why wasn't doing anything about the aluminum and steel tariffs why wasn't it going to be able to protect us from terrorists are not all
