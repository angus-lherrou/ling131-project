having a shower and I'm In the middle of the shower the water stopped working and it comes out it's like we have no water and I'm like oh okay\nAnd so he found his father in law like his dad and my father in law to come up and help them figure out why we had no water 'cause we have a well and if there's no water that means that well it's not working so the next day my father in law came up\nAnd uh they were trying to figure out why this well wasn't working and and uh\nSo my husband being like six foot two um wasn't able to sit down the well my father in law who said he could go down the law but I told them not to because I didn't want anything to happen\nSo I took one for the team and I was like well I'm small enough I could probably fit so I got caught the job of going down the well\nAnd I'm the first time ah we had a ladder connected to attract with a tow rope and then he just lowered the ladder to where I needed to go and take the pump off and that went fine I was doing the work and I got out of the wild they took the pump to the to town and it ended up that\nThe pump wasn't the problem it was\nAt the pump was fine [laughter] so they come back and they're like

went on the nine one one phoned in\nOkay so let's talk about what ... meanwhile do the bottom of the well is you and so you lend it harder I presume\nRight yes I landed in the water and um that's one
