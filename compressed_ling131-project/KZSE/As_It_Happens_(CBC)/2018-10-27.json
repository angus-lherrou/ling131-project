do\nAnything really was so he gets on the highway but he's going eastbound instead of West pounds like you\nCan even really know what to rush into your arm so he gets off its but I'm a huge turned around to start going west on the gardener and uh they're coming up for the turn off to the airport had is a phone fell out of its cradle onto the floor\nAnd he pulled over set aside the highway\nBut he didn't fully pull over he was still partially and a lot of play the traffic and he Richard this phone and then he re entered the highway which are really properly speeding up or checking is near and at the same time there was a BMW\nThat was changing lanes from the federal aid to the right lane doc driver admitted that he was a\nHe said he was checking the time on his phone I mean who knows if that's true or not he was looking at his phone\nWhile changing lanes and the damned Schreiber rear ended the river and it was exactly the point where my little brother was was sitting back laugh so my little brother side of the car took all of the impact and uh [noise] ... not cause was broken and he was basically\nKilled instantly paid fully his uh his girlfriend Monica I'm was only moderately injured\nSo suddenly what what training to do you drive or had\nNothing in twenty six teams when city council was meeting to decide\nA retro drivers what they ended up doing was just getting rid of safety training for not just a truck drivers but taxi drivers as well they lower the bar for every one it was just incredibly reckless than stupid decisions\nAre directly what's next step I picked because this tribe or idle he could have passed a the most basic safety safety test\nHe was just so unpopular and ah he had no business transferring the public at all so um what we're looking for is just some bare minimum of safety training some city attracts you to see that someone actually has a competent and safe driver before they're allowed to pick up members of the public because when you call it over you don't\nIt's it's a complete stranger who's coming to pick you up you don't know how safe route popular they are\nOr earlier this month Hoover candidate said that they think that technology now have a good job assessing a driver skill on the road and then if customers lodge safety concerns about driving the company will investigate what do you think about those measures\nThat completely ridiculous I mean it's the passengers or during the safety testing for river if a drivers on faith and confidence and I guess he or she will passengers for awhile given unfit for either the passengers will\nAlert over our race track record early I mean I'm sure this a driver would eventually we ended up that way but in the meantime the public's being put at risk\nEven experience drivers sometimes do really stupid things how ... can you be that the extra safety training would have prevented the kind of accident that your brother was killed and\nI mean yeah accidents absolute happen all the time in this case you if you could have been some freak accident if you got to have never\nHeard that would be understandable but the level of incompetence and recklessness there's just extreme and we can't be kept preventive react to that from happening but we can take simple commonsense measures to reduce the likelihood of things like this happen and\nAnd your family even launched petition to get\nRequire safety training um how hopeful are you that that will happen\nCautiously optimistic that common sense will prevail the whole um idea to completely got rid of safety training for all the drivers in Toronto was so shortsighted and naive I think it was just a bunch of a middle aged guys who wanted to see and like they were with the times\nAnd I do as someone who works in

understand the sex abuse issue within the Catholic Church and how he said the right things but has has has been very slow to act\nI'm there hasn't been as much public criticism towards him about women do you think he gets the issue of of why women should be included in in the Catholic Church and given leadership positions\nMany of us are calling for equality and are not satisfied by the slow progress that his papacy to bring women into you know substantial leadership position\nMhm but do you think he gets it you\nKnow I I really hope that he is able to meet with men who are called to be ... as a pastor I Know that he would respond to them with a a generous heart and they hope that he has a man of conversion\nYeah no I understand that that's what you hope I guess what I'm trying to
