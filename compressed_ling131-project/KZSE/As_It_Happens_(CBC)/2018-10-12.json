Congress or the administration should consider a treating this\nI guess one has to plan for all such eventuality is\nSo is this launches this ship is this as much a political statement at political action as it is a rescue mission\n[noise] I think it it first and foremost a humanitarian effort but I think it also has a\nPedagogical value as much as as political I mean I think it's important for people to recognize what the governments are doing regarding migrate rescue what governments like Italy is are blocking\nI think it also have a pet adoptable value in another sense you know I'm In the U.S and here there is a great feeling of you know not only disillusionment but powerlessness\nInterface with non we right wing governments\nRacist policies but also a feeling of even though it's probably not completely true right wing majorities favoring them I think demonstrating that even in such situations that we can do something seems to me a really important public backed a kind of demonstration\nWe certainly know there are many Italians who ... who want to help and we've covered the stories and spoken the some of those people and but it's the Taliban government has the support that's doing this and so are you looking for a confrontation the Italian government over this\nIs certainly not the intention of the projects to seek a confrontation but\nOne would be naive not to prepare for such possibility you know so there is a legal team standing by there are no plans to what to do so I don't think that seeking confrontation with the government or police it's really\nIt seems that doesn't seem to me like a useful tactic but once you shrink from it either I think that we still have to stand up for what we think's right\nAway but the people who beyond that but what about those migrants to possibly by hand\nAre they are they do become pawns in it and then literally not I'm not\nAnd that's why I said before that I think the the obvious and first purpose it's such a mission is humanitarian aid if their profits and applying for asylum in Italy or elsewhere in Europe\nOr delayed or difficult that would be unfortunate it certainly do a much better than being returned to Libya which is deemed by international agencies not if a port\nAnd eventually it will be watching it progress and watching how they see it does I appreciate you taking the thank

the most lauded achievement that you could have in the world it's certainly not necessary for a summer yet but the people who become ... has worked for years and years to achieve this goal\nAnd then to lose the people you have been talking with losses what what did they say do you\nI mean it's really devastating I have to say everyone I've spoken to is just still in a lot of shock um and they're really surprised because something like this has never happened before and especially considering that twenty three of the twenty four\nMaster some way to pass this year had work to pass this tasting portion it's usually the most difficult\nPiece of the master ... to pass\nSo it's really just been devastating not only for them but for the entire white ...\nAnd the exam is notoriously rude result three parts of it which is I guess or is a knowledge based part there is a practical part and then there is the most difficult part which is that the tasting portion of the exam just described for people what it entails\n[noise] yeah absolutely the masters only exam itself is the highest of four levels that you can achieve within the court of master's only eight so you have to pass your introductory certified and advanced exam which can take several years to pass\nSo by the time that you get to see her master's only exam first you have to pass Erie on a separate gate and then on a later date you have both a practical exam a service exam which also includes questions that you may be given on the floor as ... as well as the tasting exam which is\nSix lines that you must blind taste in twenty five\nTwenty five minutes six wines you're blindfolded or you're you're you're you can't see what you're doing and you have to identify with\nNot blindfolded you can see the winds in front of you it's usually three white and three red\nBut you must go through each of the wind systematically assess the site the aromas and the power of the line and then based on what you're tasting you must come to a conclusion on where the wind is from what the great variety is an ... vintage the wine is from as well\nWhen you consider the they say that most people ... who can't tell the difference between white wine in red wine is really extraordinary what they have to know\nYeah absolutely\nAnd so this part of the things I'm this is the part that has been called into question what exactly happened\n[noise] so we really don't know the quarter master suddenly it's America's has not released too much information on what specifically happen all we've been told is that a current master ... released information that was pertinent to the tasting flights\nOf the exam so we don't know if that was before during or after the exam because the candidates are never told what the winds are even after the exam we don't know if they reveal the identities of the wise if they just gave them some clues as to what might be on the exam we really don't know and they have\nThat release any additional information about that\nWhere they cancelled the exam results of the taste portion or the whole exam\nJust the tasting portion and they have a invalidate the results for everybody so that means is that everyone who took the tasting portion of the exam whether they passed or failed now have the opportunity to reset the exam\nWhat did the people who did the exam or did they go through to get to the point where they were doing this test\nI mean it is a huge time and financial investment to study for the masters on my example particularly the tasting portion of the exam\nProgramming is

get there is this is a huge risk lead to a lot that's been last year I Would imagine\nAbsolutely one I've spoken to other master some ways\nFor the piece that I wrote in seven fifty daily they really were boggled at why somebody would want to cheat the system because it is such a high honor why would they then want to undercut the name by giving someone out information that allowed them to cheat the exam\nYou know when we're trying to get someone to talk to us about this uh people refused to do an interview ... a Sunday does in we're talking with you agreed does that surprise you that so many people don't want to even discuss this\n[noise] it doesn't surprise me that those who had\nGained the title of master ... and now we're having taken away from them it doesn't surprise me that they don't want to talk at this point because I think for many the emotions are still raw and they also so badly want to keep this title that they want to think before they say anything publicly\nBecause one day they may be members again\nIn this organization for me I feel confident speaking about it both as a former ... and also because I have spoken to others and I would like to give voice to them
