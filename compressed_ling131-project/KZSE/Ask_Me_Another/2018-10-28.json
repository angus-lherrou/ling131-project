C. and so that that was something that I'd always wanted to do and I talk to my professor at the time and she said Shakespeare will always be there\nBut if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it so I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious pass [laughter]\nI Love those Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now\nRight now his moments so\nThis show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics you were jumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training and it's this five years you've been already has shown me up on six\nYeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of those six years I I learned things like juggling first scene that got cut and um I learned was great yeah which is right now I can juggle plates so that's sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion is for six months um yeah and yeah\nWhen you see the show you do this incredible back band that makes everyone gasped\nYeah that's the thing that I can I get thank you to a you know Jonathan notion yeah my contortion teacher amazing oh okay I was really aware of the demands going\nYou ready yeah oh yeah it was a lot and you mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it has made you a more optimistic person totally totally yeah I mean it's hard not to I mean I I have the privileges\nYou know being the sponge two and a half hours it shows a week um when did you first notice this I don't I don't know it's been a gradual increase yeah I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me\nIf I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yeah and like at first I was like [noise] no\nUm but yeah I mean like I Do and I I'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly sponge Bob had these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he's like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends end up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around everyone people tend to be taken over by their fear and buy\nTheir hatred and their ability to scapegoat others and what sponge Bob is able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself you know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days\nThat feels really for [noise]\n\nUh All right are you ready for an ask me another challenge yes I Am fantastic of course you are so even we actually found a pretty amazing opponent for you please welcome the

working on this project I think I've been involved almost six years okay yeah here's what is the evolution of the story of sponge Bob square pants the musical what is the evolution of this story has it changed from day one yeah it has\nI mean we knew okay here's the challenge rights but from a TV they're eleven minutes episodes yes we're always show you may be aware as nine eleven minutes long just a little longer a little longer so we had to figure out like how do we take that\nCrazy fast paced show and create a show that can fill in the evening and has a kind of steaks\nThe emotional stakes that are going to make us want to sit there for an evening so pretty early we sat on the idea there was going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yeah right right right and then the exact version of end of the world's changed a bunch but we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meets sponge Bob\nSponge Bob in his fellow inhabitants of bikini bottom or threatened by a volcano that is going to destroy it and people are freaking out they looked at each fish are perfectly fish fish\nAre first you have to clarify the I just saw myself and every single one of those fish at\nAnd they grow older and we were ... who is who is a mammal and there is a subtle thing where everyone ends up turning on the mammal and even spray paint a sign that says mammals go home\nWhich of course seems like a comment on the current world around us and I'm just wondering when did this entered the script\nWell you know interestingly enough it's been in there a long time in the show Sandy this girl is the only land mammal right there are aquatic mammals there's a whale but she's the only land mammal thank you I like you I don't mind\nBelow so it's perfect can you on it [laughter] so anyway\nWe always thought wrote a story about people turning against each other dealing with fear the idea of scapegoating somebody it just you know that's what happened
