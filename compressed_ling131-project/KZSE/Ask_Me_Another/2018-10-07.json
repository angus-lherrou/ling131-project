and they have are all sorts theory age usually Curtis gay tomorrow people booed like food but by the end of the two hour movie they scored it that I was the favorite person in a two hour movie because of James cabaret because of Arnold Schwarzenegger allow it\nIt shades people's for them back to be a piece of art like that\nWould be good thank God it was good was what are you know that's why

they before they started they had meetings like how did you\nHow are you there and I'm of what an idiot why didn't I think of as of this or not but it was fantastic so ... what did you do it on a just a Web page or how did I had a friend we just did it because I knew I wasn't going to get a record deal the big one and I\nI have small but mighty fan base and and uh\nAnd and I had no idea what what happened what would happen\nAnd so the response was great you're like I'm actually doing an album hair people's paid for it yeah and then uh I mean so what year was that two thousand and Ninety
