bleep it there\nAmish vehicles rather than some midpoint where the human driver might have to suddenly take control as is done with Tesla system that that would be a lot safer to actually just bypass that middle ground and go straight to fully autonomous cars but the driver doesn't have to be relied on to do anything\nJust comes team that a vet tech crunch or really took care about them he thinks this is a very exciting move and he said for the economy is actually three times the deed we told them as it goes as opposed to self driving cars defends depends on how technical you'll feeling and
