just won't sell it in Germany so if you think of the culture you have to think of the language if you think of how people played\nSo it's kind of postal German fatigue with combat games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games right is it fit into\nWhat were called German games in the nineties and then Europe games which was the interesting thing because of the
