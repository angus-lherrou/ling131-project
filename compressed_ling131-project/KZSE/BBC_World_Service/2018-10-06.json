the opposite of learn their nurses happiness\nKing you're listening to house check from the BBC with me Cody Hammons today we're discussing the results of our study to be\nAnd professor of mine way liberate to one of the team he's being analyzing the data is with me now we jak UC seems to be spending so much time on his own but I was interested to see that in a study not everyone thinks that loneliness is about being on your end today\nNo no uh we had a sort of participants believing that long and this is about being on your own but all the rest associated with very different things\nAnd I'm surprised to see the full ... percent of the people who responded told us they think that ... can sometimes be positive that seem surprising when it's such an unpleasant feeling has so much\nIs a little bit like a social first let's say so when you're very very Thursday it's not pleasant of course but it's there for a reason is there to tell you you need to drink your body is is aching for that drink\n'em and you do it and it's gone I'm learning is is a little bit like that in the sense that yes it is painful and it has to be painful so did you pay attention to what's happening and what's lacking\nBut as long as you respond to it by re directing your attention to others and to your social connections it should go away and it should be fine um so it's not necessarily negative and in fact it can sometimes be positive because it it leads to an anticipation of social connection for example\nBut of course where it goes wrong is where either you don't pay attention to those signs or you count because for example like jak as we heard just now you you have no uh no sufficient mobility no sufficient resources to actually be able to connect to others\nNow this was a global study and people from all over the well chose to take part did you find that people everywhere experience learning it well\nThe short answer is yes we did find on the nose in every country and in every age group all over the world in terms of age we can also say that the aged trend that we spoke about earlier was the same in every country the only minor differences was that in some countries the slope was steeper so that was\nOnly in is a cross the lifespan than in others but at the trend is always they are but we also found that culture can make a difference\nBut nine countries where we had enough people taking part to make some comparisons\nAnd levels of letting us well almost the same and the u._k. to us from India I was interested to see slightly lower levels in New Zealand now this isn't so representative sample of calls but I wanted to know whether this made any sense to talk to my taste Lucas and from the university who hails from New Zealand and studies mental health and young people\nThis isn't the first time that um this is being highlighted statistics New Zealand talked about the proportion of people that we're experiencing loneliness\nAll the time most of the time and it was around ... percent and then you see a launch population based on the ceiling quality of life sit by and that compares to a previous see if I Am from the u._k. was about six to scenes\nOf people so it's interesting that the research now is reinforcing this passion again\nI'm why do you think that that might be slightly lower levels of loneliness and use it and because they don't say there isn't any it's just that the levels are but law\nI have a few theories one might be around the composition of the coaches and New Zealand about a food of people come from more click divest I'm coaches\nIn particular Modi coaches that the indigenous population in New Zealand and I think that it's the positive influence perhaps of of the click to his coach is on the majority and use the European coach I Am and teams of connection and the importance of of working together and supporting each other\nAnother is is maybe around uh the proportion of one person households UCLA has a slightly lower right to that than the u._k.\nMay be a tool so to do with activities that John groups such as sports participation which she's doing well and and maybe it's the climate most of the

president is Jeff ...\nEuropean Union has negotiated with Canada and now Seventy percent of the cheese that can go into Canada has to come from Europe\nAnd only thirty percent from the rest of the world and then tariffs are duties after that or two hundred and fifty to two hundred and Seventy four percent\nNow most people wouldn't understand it a free trade agreement between the European Union and Canada affects American producers how can the European system having Seventy percent of imports into Canada for cheese and ruin your market\nUh I think they're taking a long term look you know I
