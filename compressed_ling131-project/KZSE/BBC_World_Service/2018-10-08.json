are much much wider what his reaction bring women around the country have their babies taken away\nYes exactly this is a case between one doctor and one woman who he helped deliver forty nine years ago but it's been watched across the country and the reason is that it's not really just about confronting innocence history this is about\nOpening up a really difficult chapter of Spain's paused at least that's how the campaign to see a dark part of Spain's history\nAccording to the campaign has had perhaps tens of thousands of mothers had the baby stolen in the post war years\nLike in his his mother by medical stuff for members of the Catholic Church mostly because they were judged on ... to raise that children either they were seen as political opponents opposed to general Franco's dictatorship\nOr in later years it was because they were on marriage or simply judge to pool\nLater on in the Nineteen seventies and eighties complain and say St it became a master of trafficking the children for money but this was the first trial of anyone actually involved in those alleged practices and\nWaiting for the verdict some of them said they were angry that joke because I had walked free free without any punishment one described it as a slap in the face but there were others that were happy the state had knowledge this for the very first time\nWe spoke to one mother power to an

ever see in which case child labor for the time you're supposed to change you know simple\nLots Paulos story a Lucy or just one story one case will be more\nI think that's the first thing people are waiting for now is to see what Spain Supreme Court makes if this appeal and what they say about the legal time limit for trials of this kind that's always going to affect\nHow many trials abroad in the future that have been thousands of complaints we understand but a lot of them are very difficult to follow up because it's so difficult decades later to find the evidence that prosecutors need to really bring a solid case I mean it's up to a vet of himself is believed to have destroyed evidence releasing to the case he was tried or\nOf course many of those involved are now very elderly and innocence\nThe situation to her before she died but because she was handed and it's it's a pain the mother of course had no idea who the biological parent was\n... that is the man he can tell how but despite this landmark trial and it is still a place that finding out who had the mother is or even if she said allies\nLacey thanks very much the BBC's Lucy Williams and that in Madrid and if you go

still signed up to the Paris or agreements many cities many ... bought without central government providing a lead how much difference cannot make\nWell it makes a long term difference but I'll tell you I a lot of people in our country a feeling like the federal government is letting us down than not following the science and not following the law they're trying to roll everything back but frankly they're not that good at it\nAnd so I feel confident that the rules will stay in place but it's that long term signal that you want to send\nYou know this isn't a short term problem this is this is a\nA challenge where we have the solutions today which is why on mayors and governors and why the business sector is really motivated to act because in the absence of federal leadership we can still do a lot of things at those other levels and in the business sector\nBut it's that long term investment that we're not seeing\nOne of the things you talked about marriage jobs and you know and it's been the arguments of the current president and his administration that actually jobs were on the line because of some of the decisions that were taken to get rid of coal and gas how do you argue against that\nWell you probably look at facts which this administration sometimes doesn't look that closely had you know the facts are that clean energy is winning in the marketplace that's where the job growth is it is not in the old fossil fuel sectors\nWe see clean energy taking off in the United states and it continues to move at a pace that's faster than we ever intended that doesn't mean we're nearing any finish line\nBut this administration doesn't understand about the jobs of the future versus trying to make what they call America great again by looking backwards\nWhere are you individuals can change their carbon footprint is the type of comedy Dr Americans love cause and it's and it's proved very difficult to get America change that habit\nWe had to actually regulate not to get our car companies to sell fuel efficient vehicles that Americans actually wanted to buy\nWhich is one of the reasons they were going bankrupt when President Obama came in he rescued them we we actually work with them we settle long term strategy and they've been doing well ever since mostly record breaking years they're they're adding jobs\nThey're selling cars that people want to buy this saving consumes money as a result if you want to revert to really expensive fuel efficient vehicles that doesn't save consumers anything at the pound\nAnd it also doesn't save lives by cleaning up our air pollution today in addressing the challenge of climate change for all of us\nTo go outside and large look at some of the extreme weather that America seems to be having to deal with more and more I mean is that having an impact do you think on the white people look at the climate\nBelieve that it is which is why people know what's happening but we haven't yet turned from talking about how bad climate is to make the change to talking about what what is a a a future that we all want to move towards\nWe have to think about this a little bit smarter\nAnd instead of focusing so much on the bad let's talk about the opportunities let's talk about how many lives saved if we move towards cleaner cars let's talk about how when you don't burn coal you don't spill mercury into our atmosphere that's an or a toxin ... kids\nLet's talk about the contagious diseases that are moving in a changing climate to places where we have never had them before or the droughts with facing\nLet's talk about the opportunities we have to lift everybody up and moved to a future that's better for\nAbout nothing instead of grabbing the future in running toys\nAnd this report would it make any difference to the conversation in the United states do you think they just be seen as another more of the same that's washes over people's heads\nI don't think people have grabbed climate change because I think they think it's a problem for the planet instead of the people that live on the planet I'm hoping that this will reignite a conversation but that conversation will turn from oh woe is me and how afraid am I\nTo what the opportunities of future can be\nI was Gina McCarthy former administrator of the U.S environmental protection agency [noise]\nThat I just now in the disappearance of the
