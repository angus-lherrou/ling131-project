several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know family time in this is what we should do and we push our patient as the

clinical skill and wear perch\nI went to come back to some of the other cases and challenges you face take all the first ones off skew point about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and this is a cause for a long because most treatments were designed for men not women went inside\nWell science has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only a clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the facts of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more frequently male animals [noise]\nFemale animals makes research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle and that's the reality of women so much of our science has been done on a male model\nAnd even when the laws changed in the United states in Nineteen Ninety three to include women in late face clinical trials you're still dealing with the issue of the science on which the clinical trials was based being based on a male model\nAnd can you give us an example of the disease that affects the chief ... different she\nSure let me just give you heart disease which I'm a cardiologist we see in cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque\nOr the hardening of those arteries in the heart that tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose\nWe now have the tools to make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why we actually see that difference\nSo if you don't understand why you see the difference question arises do we have the right therapy and I think those are questions that need to be asked\nThere are other disorders where we're just beginning to understand some of the differences in biology women are more likely to develop Alzheimer's women are more likely to\nDevelop depression why is that we're beginning to see some studies began to point to differences in the biology but not yet something this actionable and I've only giving you a tip of the iceberg\nBut the good news is that we are learning these things but we still have a very long way to go\nNow decree you working in an audience\nOf civil war and up until recently there was no central governing authority [noise] one of the

the\nCourse of their lives like points to go ahead what we find that it's obviously politicians of it is about saving the planet but it's also back saving people money on what we find is that people

assessment portrayed on then maybe we say it is worth taking a tour it parents so we take out some of the expense or\nOn the person is going to the professional repair uh knowing that it can be

become cheaper and now for many people repaired professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor\nAnd labor isn't text tiny so we believe I Believe that ah the tax system should change and that labor she'll be tax lower so that a professional repair to become more attractive [noise]\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business and

Nike and you and what you'll do would you like to see other companies doing more this activist campaigning as as part of the brand promotion\nI'd like to see companies take a look at well see what's
