then they voted on break it's very scary virus a wet people there's a lot of people dying to oversee people that are very scared\nBut I think you know the specificity with this outbreak is that it's happening\nHappening in an area where there's been decades of conflict and so there's a lot of tension or in in the community uh you know just last week Eighteen people uh last month sorry Eighteen people were killed in an attack by ... group on\nIn Benny this week four people were killed in an attack on the city as well and so people are very uh very scattered and angry and there's been a lot of protest\nActually being done yet at the moment ah against rising insecurity and as a result of that it's making the responses very difficult and I'm I I'm being told that every day at the moment at teens how teams have to stop for a few hours either because it's shooting a around the city oh because this protest\nAnd this is hampering that their response or the tracing of contacts of people who could be at risk\nI it's it's making vaccination a slower process slower and also making the burials ah the burials more and more difficult than that is really a key part of it\n... ... if the guy's advice that is that is very contagious I ... on on someone who has died and the burials is ready I keep haunted they respond to this is why they'd installed the new security measures wet and he's at

just is with me in the studio here in London Jonathan you wouldn't know particularly vigorously when Louis was talking about how easily this disease is spread\nYes and particularly around the area of safe burial is one of the most infectious things is a dead body unfortunately\nOr unethical says a lot of a local culture on local\nUh practices that involve quite close contact with a dead body and so in past outbreaks we've seen that this is an incredibly efficient way of spreading the virus and that's why it's it's crucial to get a lot about the buried as quickly as possible but of course it's very difficult to do that\nIf you can't get access to the communities\nAnd of course the other elements as well is this a lot of mistrust\nBeing being building unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is that they're very simple measures you you identify people who are infected\nYou isolate them and then you monitor the contacts with those people and if any of them becoming infected you isolate them and by just doing this isolation ... contacts monitoring can very quickly bring an outbreak under control because you can't do that if it's in a in an area of great civil unrest\nAnd cool sweat actually there is distrust of modern medicine absolutely\n... on this huge mistrust and and again we ... we had from Louis that there's a very effective vaccine which really well in the in the twenty fifth outbreak in guinea which is really where was\nAnd this is a very effective vaccine in these sorts of outbreak conditions but again you needs to be able to get into the communities you need to have the willing to be vaccinated so this is an incredibly challenging time\nThe world Health Organization is saying it may be another three or four months before this latest outbreak is ruled under control just how bad could things get in that timeframe\nThe worry is that there are cases which is a a cropping up in in very disparate parts of the the region so so the moment the outbreak comes around two hundred square kilometers and I'm not saying the whole of the areas ... about her infections but there are a little so sigh of outbreaks\nAnd of course if you then spread your resources over great geographical area it becomes incredibly challenging trying to do something about it so whether it's two months three months or even longer who knows at the moment\nThis question one last one is ... this is a disease which so far has been largely can find to places like that the seat but the the worry is a way that it's going to somehow get on a plane and then be spread around the world how big a risk is that briefly 'cause\nThere's there is a a risk that it can be taken to to other countries as we saw in the twin cities you know break but then isn't lights spreads too much unless those places haven't got great health infrastructure\nJonathan we'll come back to you during the course of the program as

P. C. C. the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change has come out with a special reports about one point five degrees of warming so one thing is all these protections are against a changing global climate was presumably if they didn't have it\nSo it is that if you were to implement all those options that we analyzed and hopefully we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change\nWe know if that were not happen then for example we could expect reductions in yields yet other changes in diet of people that might make them an healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the adaptation measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if you go on on our trajectory what we projected might be an underestimate actually\nMarkers spring been from the Oxford Martin program on the future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put CEO to into the atmosphere I think really false making a cool to have well generational ready and moving to a third by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David case backs solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he's at me through his logic\nFundamentally is to do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and some of the simplest way to think about wind turbines think about every winter by being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power winter that Nixon figure that winter visor all independent\nThe atmosphere is one big heat edging it's driven by power from the sun and that power is only ... connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place there's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation of energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the arguments are most ah\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest as heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequence at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nJust a patient at the energy and the wins that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heat in momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequence\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the when some might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a win for him so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't give a cooling effect of the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere and especially at night when the atmosphere\nAirline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is at night yes how much different effects I mean I can understand that too you know that could be a bit of a ... but that would be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region were large wind farms are seem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that\nBut the issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so wind turbines are immensely better than coal and we have to be carbon Massey Energy system this is all about choices we make as we do carbon eyes\nI suppose what I'm saying is one wouldn't phone on a global scale either I'm supposed to have a big effect you'll modeling is for lunch numbers if we'd in films\nYeah but one wind farm doesn't have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's not true for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one winter behind does a very intimate test them all amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduced as climate change over the whole next century over the whole world that one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs this just slightly dancing the benefits of wind farms or what you know it's all together\nDon't think it wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution in packs\nAnd given the very long time scale of of seem to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community begin to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over decades\nDensity as of winter brown and raise basically how much power you can get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested it's a very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer we've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet\nAnd we get a number it's more like half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWill not simple because I Know that you were very interested in some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more what's per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you have environmental and social impacts\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be impact free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power what have you and the big important if are finding I think is that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than the land footprint of win for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and these climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly feathers that with these new rules on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at this
