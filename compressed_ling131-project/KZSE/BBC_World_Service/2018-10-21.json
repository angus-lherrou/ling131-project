forces treaty signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev\nWas seen as a big step towards ending the Cold War the U.S and Soviet Union agreed to eliminate nuclear and conventional missiles with a range of five hundred to five and a half thousand kilometers\nBut in recent years Russia has been accused of breaching the agreement by developing new cruise missile which would allow it to launch a nuclear strike a very short notice\nPresident Obama considered withdrawing from the treaty but was apparently persuaded not to buy European leaders now Donald Trump says the U.S has no choice\nRussia has violated the agreement [noise] they've been violating it for many years that I don't know why President Obama didn't go for all out\nAnd we're not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement

clearly that they are not going to withdraw from the street they unilaterally and not probably will not be accepted with a great deal of heart by some within the international community\nThey feel that this treaty still has some value and therefore there will be some concerns that America has decided to get rid of us\nThey also mentioned China and he said the U.S is going to have to start developing the weapons that were previously bound by this treaty\nAnd that is probably the worry in a in a sentence because the truth is is a worry for other countries and I suspect many within Europe
