La Nina searching and voted much in the twin th he was going to be ... every year\nBut so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThough that impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out or around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks shops across tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the ... was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yes five up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks at least nine among annual average age of ... degree behind twenty

and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on the earth to continue to increase and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather in those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes in ...\nClimate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless talks to watch to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every yeah\nOf course you are right that one and it into what Iran is not necessarily a harbinger of what the common which is precisely the reason why we do attribution to any of them are and I think this summer and it's right\nTo say this is something different something that they used to be quite rare and it's now a relatively common and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived here words of heat heat waves\nThe atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods\nAt the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat\nYou're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nIs the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger in ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the ... jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks they also put another high over Siberia with high heat that and over North America\nWhere the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California west seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nCalifornia is getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um is getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm those summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires in what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season to California Winter isn't\nNow California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was\nThe Thomas wildfire last winter and Southern California only this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the\nThe profound challenged the climate changes already posing\nUs from our historic margin the largest fire forty now bigger than the size of Los Angeles [noise]\nYeah

I was over here I live on the coast and suffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but\nPretty immediately that fire was raising hairs and my husband actually went over and worked on that fire and um I I think we're all feeling tension that we're not used to feeling around fire in California we've had it you know the last\nTen years we've had unprecedented fires almost every every
