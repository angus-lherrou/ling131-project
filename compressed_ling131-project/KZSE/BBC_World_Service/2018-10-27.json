being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump\nI'll hang on democracy is only a good thing when people vote in a way that you'd approve of\nNo I think it's a good thing when it is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law\nYou know people can make lots of choices but their choices cannot uh include for example the depriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us what\nLinked D.C between demanding dignity and identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have that we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized\nAnd that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that a dignity we want the society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity than race\nThat people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years\nYou recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump\nDidn't you know so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are ah she said yes it does it says that it's the people\nThey are descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect that something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of that National Community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know what I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nNow that will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like victim oil dining Hungary who you mentioned in your book\nI'm like the alternatives to Germany movement that you will send mentioned that will be loads of people who who who listen to you and think\nWhat a ... view you know what a liberal Californian view your day mate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and got all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where the gonna we're gonna be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to\nHave a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions\nAnd integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively a and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say her you know not California and that that are rooted\nOne particular ethnic group if a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that's democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt is from Chrissy an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um the Justice Department and\nI think that if she gets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now\nAnd I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts him dependence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity they demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black\nIt's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk ... democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes\nBut like we've gotten middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got to anything stable to stand on so I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to end\nAre always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other and the same in the same set a sentence [laughter]\nSo identity politics ... it's really saw shifting sons in terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either ends as extreme\nAnd people gravitate towards the middle where we find unhappiness with it and therefore won't say effectively how the freedom to go back to the extremes which then become uncomfortable and we moved to the middle so the modernization that constant brightening motion effectively in politics is really interesting\nDo you have political beliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show my identity is it's a multi faceted and so my political
