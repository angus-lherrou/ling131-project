only southern nuclear attack where there was not a lot of time to furnish message um that message was always going to be carried on radio and television and most Americans will probably recognize the shrill\nCats are from the regular tests that have been going on right flood tomorrow's is different because tomorrow will be the first time a system that was built over the last few years to allow it broadcast or directly to cell phones is being used\nActually interesting because cell phone's been around for a while I was just the government is catching up a little bit late\nRight this was actually a implemented as a couple of years ago during the Obama administration as a way to say\nThe civil defense status that is the emergency alert system needs to be modernized and now that we have this new phenomenon which is to say everyone in America more or less has a cell phone on their person um wouldn't it be nice to be able to reach them immediately old television\nAnd radio channels would come together and we'll broadcast from the prison walls will do a a sort of a pre recorded broadcast\nEssentially yes there was um a FCC requirement um the Federal Communications commission\nOr in the U.S that you had to participate if you are public broadcast or private broadcaster for that matter ... so if you are one of the primary channels for your city or your region\nYou would be um made to carry a message or the or more just yet where it would go off and they would say this is a message from the White House stay tuned for more information stay on this channel\n... and they would they would do tests so Americans with ... with the sound but that would be told that this is a test of the system as the as the emotions you Brokaw system\nYes there was a required a monthly test and some places the weekly test as well but often you know it was a midnight or a little bit later so I'm a lot of people found out by when they snoozing on the couch or it would make them up in a very ...\nThat sounds like a cultural thing this is the ... the Americans know the outside of America wouldn't know that is that's a great detail I Love that [laughter] so do people talk about this\nThere's been this rising tide of awareness where people are realizing that this is something that is going to happen\nPart that's really getting people burn is the fact that it will say it will be labeled at the top of the the text message that arise as presidential alert\n[noise] yeah I'm a social media message from President Trump um ... wouldn't be confusing would ditch [noise]\nUh no I don't I think at some point or another\nThat is what everyone is fearing is that the system will be taken away from its original purpose and that will suddenly get an emergency alert to the entire nation that says no collusion but there are also to road blocks I think having that happen right the first one is that is legal they did set this up to say\nThere is a way to you this is only for emergency situations and anything else especially politically would be illegal now a lot of people say well maybe that doesn't slow you down to legal part won't stop someone who has already done so much to a scandal as the country\nUm but the actual activation procedures it would go from the White House in in Trump's authority only but the procedures would be handled by FEMA so the officials there would have a modicum of oversight to say the least I don't think that it would be like his Twitter account where he had on constrained access at any time\nRight so it is slightly unfiltered by the emergency management um uh people presumably Yukon reply to this text\nRight and [laughter] I I Want\nTo think of what would happen if someone else took control of the system though and sent some message either in farce or in you know ... to the entire country in the wrong moment right that that would be a a worse situation almost than having a real message come through\nA at an untimely time\nReply old would lead to trouble wouldn't it address to see any of the ... center at the Harvard Kennedy School or just to spoil your anticipation that message was going to get says this this is a test of the national while this emergency alert system no action is needed ... coming from the beginning\nIs the thing I'm I'm In fact well what a hundred other people are interested eating is the kind of the fact that many people who have a ... to the current ... of the White House will just come and go I don't want to Mr the president's going to ignore it even when it could be quite important uh likewise if somebody else we're in the White House\nThe other half of America would a possibly avoid it as well\nAs he was saying um it just feels as the president ... really send a personal message a bear in mind that these folks lumps do actually have to remember Hawaii that there was lots of ... there was a a a false alarm of a ballistic missile which went home for thirty minutes before\nThe pug was actually pulled the noise by the way I'm quite pleased we can't play it to you I was playing it on my computer when I came in and suddenly the whole office was looking at my age

do those those are his words not mine are President Trump's lawyers has written a I've responded to the times story saying the allegations of fraud and tax evasion all one hundred percent photos\nAnd highly defamatory or so for the president has broken with the practice of past presidents and has refused to release his tax returns there's programs because who just spoke to one of the journalists who had the story David Busta\nEtiquette reveals to important one is it reveals that the central narrative\nThat Donald Trump has talked throughout his life and especially in his political campaign for the president of the narrative that she is self made billionaire basically started with a million dollar loan from his\nFather turned it into this incredible Baldwin park that that narrative is actually at a record itself the earth's record of many pages of documents inside the real estate empire of drug Trump the president\nAnd record shows the fact that Donald Trump tree out his life is

anywhere from five six seven million dollars a year from his father's financial empire\nOne wants to be what's wrong with that you might use money once in a while\nYeah notice there's absolutely nothing wrong with parents supporting their kid the part where there is something wrong is that the amount of money that Donald Trump received from his father was significantly increased by a series
