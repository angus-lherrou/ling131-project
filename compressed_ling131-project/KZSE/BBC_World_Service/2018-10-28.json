government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you\nOr is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show is to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see through TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there's only so much news\nA space for a run a son and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is a transform country whether you look at it\nPhysically or you look at it socially I'm I ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country\nI grew up in the war our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nOr to help us along that way and know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yes we are at war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end a and it takes a it it it takes more now than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks ... support who are being helping and\nThat to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve we ... we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions a pivoting toward you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particularly the United states and of course you\nA former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric Prince formerly the head of Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contract to force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we showed a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism a and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now\nIt turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's\nAfghan and why is all my ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nKnew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with did negotiate\nThe initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire where well\nI'm going to tell you and I'll and I'll tell you I was calling because we have to do that I don't think it'll stay straight on said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports it's sources saying quote\nFills that I had these meetings with ah the officials from the Taliban\nJust uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one confirmation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report that just because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ambassador\nObviously you didn't know he is very exhausted from his trip you didn't get to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the\nTaliban and it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban\nNow the Americans seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident uh dictate an entire policy\nAnd that's not what the American stands as we are uh in in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process Africans do own and drive the peace process and that's the only way for its success\nIt's not that we we want the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be a shame that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm are asked by a ... through a process why on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's rights to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell where the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite their threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see where whether the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the African people accept can only be known if they participate in a in in a democratic process and let the Afghan people choose\nHow ... we have to end it there but I
