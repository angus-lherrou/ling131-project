I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seventh day\nTwenty eight and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate got submissions\nCan ... well I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on cold in the works\nBut I don't know oh yeah we're talking about oh yeah but my\nPoint is that if you have replaced\nCoal plants root for example gas or even oil\nThat will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the verdict greener refers has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah do\nAll the stuff is in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than so many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty

being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas\nSo as a politician and in a country like new way would you largely agreed is

been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it seems so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince the kind of\nTo look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example we are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our air place to make their more renewable\nBut where do you have to do so well uh you get to perhaps if you're a lucky from or organic waste and it's part of this circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our lands part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the

name it's part of the stresses they because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green is a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it\nThe coal plants to make the word more green\nGay or at the same time we have to address CCS as his view because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nBut not one of which have successful even know ... again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the

the also an aide to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan

and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument is that you will see now that when you have energy will indeed be more cost effective\nThan

that is according to the carbon projects and if you see the court and press has been originally sees this summer it is a totally different pictures coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe\nGas will exclude cold if because of what you mean by the carbon price the price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nAnd there's a market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you guys will push out cold enough push

Senator Jeff flake voted yes in today's procedural votes as he will vote yes to the nomination tomorrow unless something big changes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no today so she will again tomorrow telling reporters that Kavanaugh is a good man but not the right man for the court at this time\nAnd right now we're waiting for another key swing senator Maine Republican Susan Collins to make a statement she voted yes to end debate today but may soon say how she actually plans to vote\nTomorrow Collins is going to be speaking on the Senate for momentarily and we will bring that speech to live when it happens but as we wait we're joined in the studio by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow a welcome to both of you know\nWhat are you expecting and the next few minutes [laughter]\nIf I if I had a crystal ball believe me I would've said what I was expecting before I visited one of those very dramatic moments because if Susan Collins says that she's going to vote no with Lisa Murkowski then everything\nIs on senator Manchin of West Virginia who's a Democrat in a very red state West Virginia and\nI have no idea whether these three people have been consulting each other the way they did actually up ... up until let's say ... a day or two ago but at the time when we were that all the stuff was going on about was they're going to be\nAny sort of an FBI investigation um mansion Collins Murkowski 'em and flake all were in constant touch with each other now the question is Scott\nWhat do you think's gonna happen I think there are a couple indications that that that ... is going to vote for Kavanaugh the fact that she she viewed the FBI investigation is very thorough unlike Democrats who said that it was woefully short and the fact that she just\nThere are only emerged from the lunch saying he felt very confident about how the votes going to go he did not look like a leader suddenly scrambling to get the nomination across the finish line\nWho would want to be the meaner Scott just remind us what's the math here tomorrow morning we'll let you know what happened to this uh ... changes as we said right now it's fifty one forty nine to nearly ... ... what are we let you got your guy in it and\nUh the the Senate is divided fifty one forty nine Republicans at fifty one seats Democrats or forty nine seats uh today's cloture vote was a party line vote with two exceptions Murkowski hop to the Democrats to vote no mansion hop to the Republicans to vote yes\nSo if there's one more no votes and there was today and it's fifty fifty then vice president Mike Pence comes and breaks the tie which would certainly be unprecedented for a Supreme Court confirmation vote\nScott as you watch this and the decisions that the senators are making\nIt does appear from the outside that their own futures are in their minds more than anything else perhaps that they're thinking about whether this is ... whether it's Joe mansion or whether it's Susan Collins or or others that they're thinking about what it means for them politically coming up in the midterms\nAbsolutely Joe mansion that's the case more than anyone else Joe mansion is a Democrat running for reelection in West Virginia where President Trump is wildly popular\nHe somebody who supported a Trump last nominee Neil Gorsuch\nAnd uh before before the Ford allegations heroes look very likely to vote for judge Kavanaugh mansions in a tough spot and I really don't think he wants to be viewed as the decisive vote but that's where he is because if you go if you vote for Kavanaugh if he helps get cabin on the ... on the court as the lone Democrat and a decisive vote\nDemocrats will will blast him and and and maybe abandoned him over the next few weeks but if he votes no then uh then he might lose a lot of support in Maine where again President Trump's or if ...\nGuys are looking at pictures outside Susan Collins office\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...
