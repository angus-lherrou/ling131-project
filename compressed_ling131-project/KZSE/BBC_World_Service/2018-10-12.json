degrees Celsius but that's going to comment to price\nIs the well on track to me anything like that target festival\nTo clarify that the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the governments have asked the eyepiece you see\nIn two thousand Fifteen in the Paris Agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now just report\nClearly shows that there is a important difference between warming one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAs there just to be clear is the well I'm trying to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rural is knock on track currently the pledges of the countries that they submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereas a mission should be decreasing very very steeply or by twenty thirty\nSo painted the picture was\nRising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nExample for coral reefs are two degrees of warming we don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive\nAt one point five degrees of warming it it's still possible that some of them survive also for four to ... ecosystems there is a really clear shift in the impact\nEvery kilowatt hour every mega ... is

going into energy so we cannot say that there are no losers what we can say is that\nThese losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term losses but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of garments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the fossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies\nSectors that were saying it may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we cannot mitigate we have to me to get these short\nTerm ... if I can just bring you back from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um well I'd\nLike to sort of question some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the terms of ... we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement although I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the parents agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can I say the\n... financial products or pension products have to be aligned with a one point five Paris target for example I can argue that not in the parliament's no gain support for that were previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and I imagine a world of these climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult it will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it was just want to work to do that when asking the question who is going to pay to for this one we should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one does this reading an investment in a safer and ...\nGoing to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe and today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree are forming\nAnd ... degree or form in ... in the far future this is um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so does this really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to eat carefully managing managed showed up they she the poor of the impacts of food that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare Laurie wants to\nCome back and yeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a Nineteen nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to see that when you both and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly so he just making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instance has agreed no but ... is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient\nSolution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to realize and there's been um

some evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for a think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he may have Monday's PCC reports\nI've investigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple viewpoints one of them is that what they are ...\nMuch more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they are claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations about his level\nBut I I mean okay so you're saying they'd been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this more serious than\nAh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's as in David ... they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Julius I'm begging with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and he uses science to argue for the fact of use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBoard wants to come in bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line and South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something but the American government has signed up\nAggregate and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states and cities some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level in the states\nI unimportant Lee when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states the colon stunning United States is in long term decline because it's simply cheap to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts of becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said oh it's with the kinds of conversation that we've been hunting here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including coal mining industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence that climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because it's C level rise and as a good chance that the warmer than average losses in the Gulf well partly poma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change and

month in the wake of a recommendation that the pilot made to reinstate Russia offer a three year long suspension full\nIt's remarkable ... alleged state sponsored doping scandal now in the wake of that recommendation waters executive committee a rubber stamp that and much to the dismay of many athletes and national aunts WMDs around the world Russia was back in the fold\nNow Scott's very respected voice in the anti doping community shoes and everything ready the athletes in the Olympic and Paralympic will have to a figurehead and so when she quit and made a big impression but she's kept quiet until now she's broken Assad and in this interview\nAnd she made clear that she felt she had no choice but to resigned in protest she felt with decision was unacceptable because Russia She

you that she'd been subject to what she described\nAs disrespectful comments and behavior by very senior members of wild executive committee\nIs tainted as with the level of disrespect and and my
