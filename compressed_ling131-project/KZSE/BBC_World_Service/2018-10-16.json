this is a privilege to attendance university and that's a privileged I Hope many other Asian Americans will have to come I think that when you look at the case here of affirmative action\nWe shouldn't just be looking at whether or not affirmative action is right or wrong but sort of how affirmative action is impacting different communities and so the point of affirmative action has been to support\nCommunities that has historically been underrepresented are excluded it seems like it's failed Asian Americans right now as it looks like Harvard\nAdmissions policies are discriminating against Asian Americans and systematically keeping their numbers lower\nIt's hard to say what my personal file looks like a sort of how it affected me but I think the interesting thing is to look at it on the aggregate and how the Asian American population has been increasing in America rapidly but the amount of Asian Americans admitted to Harvard has been staying around the same person for the past ten years\nSo you have the idea that the students don't mind that speak to Gregory Davis who's a grad student at Harvard or who's in favor of the affirmative action is Gregory thanks for coming on what's your reaction when you hear arguments such as those just made by ...\n... uh her parents make for was things and I am happy with your um but I think she was a mistake or about what the point of affirmative action\nActually set to make a underrepresented groups uh be more pressing the point over affirmative action is to increase diversity and increase the benefits of diversity one thing that's been that's been talked about as much in\nThis lawsuit is what it means to have a critical mass\nHere at Harvard and many other colleges and universities across the country there are a critical masses isn't quite frankly\nAsian students um don't have to walk on campus and feel like they're necessarily represent this other group um or that they have to speak for every person from that background I'm this is particularly true of Chinese um\nStudents are are students are Chinese background however for African Americans\nFor Latino Americans for indigenous Americans is is not that this is simply not\nOkay so you're saying that even with the ... election as it currently works in in in most areas of higher education I mean you just tell us about your experience but just before you were at Harvard you you were at UCLA and one of the complications of this fact is is that in California\nAs soon as you mentioned isn't allowed so what was the effect on the view of walking into class being one of the very few African Americans I I presume that that's how you felt\nOh absolutely and there was the case um I entered into a class of about two hundred and fifty are entering law students and I was one of twelve African Americans um this is and\nThe state of California which\nIs as much more than just style four percent uh for me I was three or four percent African American and this was in an environment in which I was you know in classes on the debate in highly intellectual and highly social issues that involve things like race um in history\nAnd I was one of two African American men in the room this how the huge effect on my ability to um\nTo judge the issues to be able to voice\nRight I can see that so it becomes it becomes personalized it becomes emotional and of course what you'll you'll get to study principles and argue about\nA sort of intellectual facts are without being muddied in that way [noise]\nI Wish that was the case yeah unfortunately it very rarely happened that\nWay for example in your class was than not one or two Asian a Chinese and Marilyn how did we should defined them or have they already managed to establish numbers in the education system that means that they have support and critical mass of that kind\nI Believe they do now this is not to say that there aren't underrepresented sub groups within an Asian Americans are among the ... a ... a south east Asian Pacific Islanders students I absolutely underrepresented um an all facets of higher education but if we're going to talk about Asian Americans as a as a\nGeneral group um they're representing well both at schools that don't practice in front of accident in I argue schools that do and why would that be I think it has a lot to do with the caliber students applying um the number of students applying\nUm and where do they decide to activate their applications are obviously I I think it makes a lot of sense that a lot of Asian Americans to apply to harbor a one interesting fact about this entire lawsuit that is not discussed as much\nAs that I'm twenty two percent of the entering class of Harvard every year um roughly\nIs Asian American but also twenty two percent of the application pool is Asian every year\nWell they you up some direction two sides of the student argument is an argument that uh is being taken to the court case are taken to court or against Harvard University at the moment\nI should say is a little bit of background in this um many places um and you had that for example California actually bans affirmative action but ... as a

years of the post war period he became what the scholar Edward Tim's is called a quote reluctant Democrat that is to say that cross was always a bit hesitant to fully endorsed the political changes

known punk Republican opponent don't bacon is a one to congressman and the retired air force general\nScared of everything's was never a guy probably ... or seek it out there that I got started baking but anyway uh Oh yes the name of notice he made the bacon jak than I Do every time [laughter]\nBut I have an average or cooking baking I said when he saw making it's even better you\nTake a hard state of Washington you will take the heat\nThat's why I don't like breaking up the wage\nShrinks our national defence get our economy moving and provide ...\nBecause every one of the rest of those that you throw the\nBaking is even better\nWhen they give you my fire okay and do you have like he says that he's turning up the heat on his opponent\nSupport comes from urban homework stable homes offer long

donate\nA net and that's the choice in this race her positions maybe play well San Francisco and Berkeley maybe New York they don't play well in Nebraska\nWhere you know what they say here in Nebraska if you don't like what the weather wait a couple of minutes [laughter] about it\nAs something snowstorm descends on Omaha as I get to meet the city's film and democratic man my ... he doesn't agree that cholera Eastman will lose traditional democratic votes is arguing that has sent to these policies no longer on the fringe\nShe's not to the left she's really speaking out to what needs to happen it's it's the logical changed that needs to come from progressive systems of government\nSo you're saying the center of gravity of the Democratic party has changed is changing\nWhy take the center of gravity for the whole country has changed because\nThere are people now who have no medical care where one of the few countries in the world or they're supposed to be civilized that doesn't take care of our people through healthcare so this is nothing radical uh the history of our Democratic Party has been progressive always has\nI mean it's just like I said Social Security Medicare Medicaid this is just the next logical step I think it's progress under ...\n... you might if I you know a couple more questions are I\nI was young they can campaign volunteers campus votes we get the view of the wise old man of the Republican Party how do full term congressman and to to mayor of Omaha he says the bacon Eastman contest has national implications so think about this race\nAs a bellwether indicator\nNot only of how things are now but how they may be drifting over the next two years\nSeems to me that if done baking the Republican nominee winds here that will be a signal that the composition of the voter be that Republican Democrat male or female rural or urban or suburban\nIs still leaning objectively moderately to the right\nWith race at all as I Am at this point in time or oh I see\nOn the doorstep counter eastern seems to be winning hearts minds ... votes but would it be enough for victory was brutally conservative state like Nebraska send the progressive punk fund to Washington a question for the support says she's just spoken to that don't ...\nI Believe that there is potential for our movement based on current political standings I maybe I should say I hope versus I Believe\nProbably rather than belief and without a democratic votes would otherwise spoke to Roseanne morning she's political reporter with the Omaha will Harold she told me that this race is shaping up to me the most expensive one this congressional swing district has ever seen at the moment she says the funding momentum seems to be with Kara Eastman\nEastern raise one point two five million dollars in the last three months that triples what she had before and she got a lot of money from\nIndividuals as opposed to committees are groups are companies or whatever and and it's from all across the country she's become it shows that she's become this kind of figure head and progressive business\nAnd does that mean that this race and this one district\nMy uh become this bellwether for how the Democratic party to use his running and where it is going\nYet so the um progressive groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one in the only ones that this kind of new crop of leaders that in\nA conservative area so if she can win here you're going to see a lot more progressive trying to make the case and other swing districts that they can win and then they should get national support because look ... and did it\nIs there's something about what's happening here in Omaha Nebraska has brought to to the top in the Democratic party or is it simply a national picture\nOh so the demographics of Omaha haven't changed all that much but I Do think that this is the year for progressive and you're seeing that here as well as elsewhere it's ... we had progressive in Omaha\nBefore um but they never had a candidate to rally around like this and a lot of her policies are becoming kind of mainstream democratic principles and so you're seeing and she she has more opportunities this year than she would have previously\nNow we're talking about midterm elections which don't generally get used to an outside and that's going to be key to that so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide but we'll let necessarily translate into votes\nSo that's a good question so her whole hypothesis is that she needs to give\nVoter that Democrats in Nebraska should give voters or reason to be excited and then they'll show up for and they haven't shown on previously for the more moderate so she's doing a lot of door knocking and be heard and she's doing a lot of outreach to voters directly because her whole strategy is trying to turn out the boats\nAnd you don't see many of us who has done bacon is sizzling bacon I have a very ... you say it on the TV every coughing up but you don't see her\nShe she does have some ads she's not focusing on it as much you might see\nMillion on but she also it's been a lot of money on voter outreach which isn't a traditional typical path they take and what about the Trump factor how does how does he play into this race in this state so Trump um came here and spoke and bacon stuck on stage and on\nRight now it seems that cabin his nomination of cabinet in particular is actually turning on both sides so Democrats are really mad about cabinet but you're also seeing Republicans mad about how Democrats handled it and one thing that I'm hearing a lot from Republican winning is that\nThey are upset that liberal women have kind of been speaking for all women and they want to send a message no we're not\nWhat the the ... these other women and say that we are [noise]\nThat was Roseanne morning or from the whole world Harold Jamie you clearly dumb the defining these midterms out of him on a breakfast and seems women's from talking to us while you're moving mix but where are you moving next\nYes for a large she'll be heading northeast to a state that is familiar to news outlets and it's not just in America because that would bring to which comes in one or two times before\nMost recently for the state of the union address at the beginning of this year we met some folks who uh well they were in a district which voted heavily for Barack Obama than heavily for Donald Trump and they were big fans of it are they still big fans will have a have a look at that will also be looking at the Senate race that which is an interesting one ...\nVery interesting the governor's race things are a whole string of course of races in the midterms all of them will have a say in how the next couple of years with the Trump presidency goes\nWe remain signs of you this is news a distribution of\nWorld Service news
