the movie could grill plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando at the commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando is kind of a shock looking back uh but the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis's first hits were also hits on the black charts on the rhythm and blues charts he was doing something\nWith the African American rhythm and blues tradition\nAnd so although he has often sort of seen as inappropriate or and you could say he is or is not but a lot of his African American peers at the time also enjoyed his singing and his take on the African tradition\nSo Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any one said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time so we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impact to people like James Dean into Elvis Presley and popular culture has of course being huge and it's transmitted is such an idea of crude across the landscape but I Wonder what you will see in Kobe really choking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe no\nIt's sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but\nTen years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line a global poll and among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great surprise it was American\nAnd the second question was why and this is the important part for cool the answer was because of the coolest people live there and the people they named where I ... we actually considered cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that cool is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course true\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is a concept for self definition\nWell it's you'll hear well the American concept of cool inspired young people around the world this is in part because American music and Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nBut cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures\nAdolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial young people the rebels style could be used a signal their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty racism corrupt governments and oppression persisted both in the former colonies and then the former colonial powers\nThere was a film that picked young post colonial rebels um the French Film la Han from Nineteen Ninety five directed by much it costs the vets\nIn which three young men from the ... the housing projects on the outskirts of Paris try to figure out how to respond to police violence to bear is of African descent ... of Arab descent and Vince is Jewish\nOne of their friends has been shot by police during a protest\nAnd they adopt a cool detached style to feel invincible to feel strong and they emulate what they've learned from pop culture but they discovered it doesn't protect\nKind of what you think about this idea of coups cultural imperialism\nFor me it's not just about the kind of a chopping down if you like but it was that what Claudia and jelly beans saying is that making use of those references to create something new and to say something new about their own experiences in particular a particular geographical space\nI suppose that's what we've been tracking throughout this parade ground the way\nI Know the generation and turned it into it saying I'm not as we've been hearing who hasn't remains ...\nJob today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that cool but it seems to run counter to the original rebellious spiritual detachment from the mainstream of conformity that we've been talking about so it was cool today there's\nConformity cool marketing cool and there's rebel cool and the marketing cool is the kind that people promote products and make it seem like you're a rebel if you have one or you'll be popular any of those things and then there's the grassroots rebel cool and which\nPeople and laid out adolescence choose icons that they admire that are rebels that they in a sense vicariously live through or lead them to their own path\nSo I Would say in terms of marketing cool cool is a rebel sensibility for consumer culture and that's ironic right so you don't want to conform so you pretend you're a rebel even though you're conforming\nBut for me the rebel cool part the part that still vital on alive I Would define rebel cool simply dissuade cool is how we go she ate maternity\nProgramming supported by bus stop solutions crafting custom Web and mobile apps

to Mr cabinet for what he called the campaign of political and personal destruction against him\nNow we'll know much more now about Supreme Court justices of how they're appointed and how recently

had gotten a phone call from someone close to the leader who\nHad told him do not rights do not appear on television do you not tweets and I was told that there's just went against who he wasn't the person that he cannot exist like that one friend of his are very close friend of his\nSaid that he was afraid of going into Saudi conflict even the embassy in the U.S she had said that when he would go into the conflict in the U.S he would send her a text message and then when he left he would send her another text message as a recruiting caution\nAnd what about what about the comes with a new stumbled because he he devoted his time between Washington and stumbled\nWhile I was told from that friend who had dealt with him though because you know his decree going in and out at the end of the embassy in D.C she told me that's why his fiance was outside of the conflict in assemble because he was concerned about his safety and any of those promises\nThe U.S vice president Mike Pence said the Saudis have to be transparent and the investigation how much pressure do you sense there is on the Saudis\nDifficult to say one of the reasons why I Am most high told me that area one was more restrained in his comments in some of the Turkish officials had been into leaks\nIn their beliefs of his show gay being killed in the conflict with because turkey is waiting to see what the US's

pressure died on ... it doesn't seem like they're really reacting any pressure because they haven't really any French\nThey haven't said anything beyond that day camera footage working working at a time to him coming into the conflict\nChristina you'll know ski a freelance journalist speaking to me from Istanbul\n[noise]\nAnd exactly one month's time Americans will vote in midterm elections their results will help shape the next two years the Trump presidency\nRepublicans control both the house of representatives which is up for reelection in ... and the Senate where a third of the seats are being contested bought the Democrats are hoping to retake one or both of those houses\nWill they vote the veteran journalist and author Thomas Frank has long been a sharp left wing critic of the policy arguing that it it turned its back on its traditional working class opposes\nAnd become defined by smugglers and complacency which culminated in the election of Donald Trump his new book room the with oblivion reports from sinking society charts what he calls a period of sinking liberal hopes\nI Love spoke to someone as Franco news out on the day off to the Trump victory I often have the Democrats learned anything over the past two years\nBut no they haven't but that's not to say that they won't do really well this fall they may well sweep Congress this fall but if they do so it's because of what you know it's for the same reasons that they always get rescued which is that the Republicans [laughter]\nScrewed up you know that you've got this guy in the oval office who is\nA antagonize so many voters\nSo no the Democrats have not taken to heart any of the things that you and I\nTalked about so long ago two years ago now\nWhile you're not do think because they don't want to you know they like being who they are and they can see it as well as I can that someone like say a Bernie Sanders figure is extremely popular and the public would really go for a a you know the kind of policies that someone like that would put in place but that's not what\nThey're interested in they just aren't interested in that they're interested in something else is a category mistake that's not who they are they also\nIn in some of that front of me that they have gone full\n... candidates in certain places it yet always are in Nebraska as well as in places like New York state where you might expect that so are are they are they shoot sort of a different policy already starting to rise up ... I was just I\nSorry I shouldn't I shouldn't be so glum and so negative because of course there are examples that you just mentioned there's a guy running for governor in Florida who looks really good there's a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in I Believe in the Bronx in New York City she looks really good and these people there's and there's many other examples\nAnd these people make me hopeful there's always some good people and the Democratic party and there's even good people\nWho are making noise is like the running for president in twenty twenty Elizabeth Warren is seems to be suggesting seems to be hinting at that I think she's the best thing in the world I'd love to see her run for president but are you saying that the party machine and actually\nThe ... yes and I'm thinking more about it's probably unfair to I'm Talking about the Democratic party because the organizations in this country are so diffuse [laughter] they aren't really even organizations\nBut I'm Talking here about the sort of pundit class in America that really sort of determines what nice liberal people think and that pundits class is how would I put this a doubling down on this sort of the philosophy of two thousand and sixteen intensifying their commitment to that philosophy\nIt's a professional class plus various other groups women minorities\nYoung people that is you know the Democratic party and that's devoted to the Democratic party and that's you know all fine\nBut the important thing is what do you do about the white working class what do you do about this enormous group of voters that have slowly but surely over the decades\nMoved from the Democratic column and to the Republican column and for many years the answer that this sort of punted class in America would give is\nThat's not happening we don't need to worry about that and then all of a sudden in two thousand and sixteen it became undeniable that that was happening and so their answer now is to say there's nothing we can do about it what if they're going to win big as you suggest in the midterms what's wrong then if they get power back\nThat's the name of the game isn't it it's a short term thing is the problem Democrats often when because when the Republicans screw up and then the Republicans come back a couple of years later and and get them back this is the natural coming and going of American politics but let me remind you of the way\nThe sort of political situation in this country used to be after the Nineteen thirties and that was at the Democratic party controlled Congress from the year Nineteen thirty up until the year Nineteen Ninety four with only two brief interruptions\nOr the Democratic party was overwhelmingly dominant in this country and the reason for that was because they were a party that was obviously and clearly identified with the interests of working people\nAnd that's not the case anymore and they you know they did the Democrats deliberately turn their back on that version of themselves beginning in the seventies but sort of a coming into fruition in around Nineteen Ninety four and they turn their back on that version of themselves and they have never really recovered from it you posit at the end of your book the unthinkable\nTo Democrats of President Trump getting reelected what would you give us Jones is at the moment\nYou know whenever I had all sorts of coffee out there that I said if if he you know this is all off if he gets impeached or if he does if he\nTrade wars or if he gets in a real shooting war you know which he could easily do\nThen all bets are off but the way things are going right now I hate to say this as you have no doubt guessed I'm pretty far to the left I think Trump has a very good chance of being reelected in twenty twenty\nYou don't think the Democrats have a candidate up their sleeve who can talk to those votes as they need to get back into the fold they do there are Democrats out there who can do that the problem is that if the country stays on the track that it's on right now the economy running flat out the accelerator\nDown unemployment getting less and less and less if that continues I don't know who can I remember the period of the Nineteen nineties when we had\nThis sort of boom economy of the Nineteen nineties and there was real wage growth for a couple of years and Bill Clinton became incredibly popular you know like sixty Seventy percent approval ratings and this was this was when he was in the middle\nIs a process of being impeached you know it was it was the most incredible thing and I can't help but think that if you get that kind of economic situation again almost doesn't matter\nWhat the other side does and that\nWas the American author Thomas Frank on his new book
