any other government in the world you might say it's almost a kind of trial run for us all to surveillance state\nIn which everyone's behavior is going to be monitored they'll have little ID cards and

former ... from the United states and Britain Kamen founded these countries as a form of\nEnabling black people to own the means of production and running their own state of affairs um and so the two countries have re citizenship clauses that basically stay only people of negro descent so effectively black people can be citizens of Liberia and Sierra Leone\nUm and what's fascinating for me about this historically is that you know the Westphalia and systems says uh or or sort of used whiteness as a reference for citizenship white and it's a male and this as a reference for citizenship but what these countries are effectively doing and you can debate whether or not it's right or wrong is that they're\nCentering blackness as a reference for citizenship and for me this is an incredibly

under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing does life he was shot to death the day after\nHe gave a Sunday sermon directing themselves specifically to the members of the armed forces and saying to them you do not have to obey and immoral ordered to go out and and kill people\nAnd that did not go down well with some of the authorities said who killed him well it was\nYou know on the government's side the military or were recalled these death squads although it's really important to point out\nThat there was a growing left his movement here to ensure the grew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war and when they did when they committed human rights abuses archbishop Romero was very quick to condemn them too so he was even handed\nIf you will you make a mistake and are you do something wrong and you could count on him denouncing you\nFor it in his homily the following Sunday no matter what your political

H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learn more at your age are go dot com\nSuperstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense another example is the way that he respects or sort of the rules of some that are mind will rely on so\nIt's a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily we use that\nTo determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program on on those a bit of the museum about voodoo and um but producing those very cruelly brought along some pictures of my son loved ones and I was asked if I Would like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so chasing it with a bad outcome of anything happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different here is Dick which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of the lake ness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between two things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our mind\nAnd why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how\nA very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates very quickly in automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources\nOr sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition\nAnd the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air and what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case\nSometimes that slow system recognizes the air it recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintains that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment I Want you to imagine this I have three of ... on the table and one of them you don't know which has the money inside that you can win\nI Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three chosen\nOkay good now you can keep your ... or you can swap it for the remaining to employers would you go full\nShould go for the two [laughter] no question here rationally what you should do but a lotta people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they work\nAre likely to win a this is where the magic comes and so they're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade there aren't below and the rational knowledge that they should\nWe find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel up\nWhile thought they could really high number and so what you're saying there is that that kind of choice the between the intuition and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and sometimes the rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first in Jewish and system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not a rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it so another thing to consider is the costs of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the new do so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi irrational person on the radio\nBut the cost of ignoring the intuition that I see this is going to be really positive I ... through a picture of a loved one that's a big cost so I'd rather avoid done not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you're having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying at\nI mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining it as a possibility\nRise in the you are listening to crowd science on the b._b._c.
