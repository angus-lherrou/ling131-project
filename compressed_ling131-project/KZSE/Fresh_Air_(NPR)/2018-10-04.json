Steven John most voters say healthcare is one of the top issues if not the top issue they are concerned about this year\nThis hour you can learn more about the pros and cons of one of the proposal to improve our health care and health insurance system sometimes called single payer DFL state senator John\nMarty of Roseville has been a leading proponent of single payer and he discussed this idea with Republican state senator Scott ... who is\nAlso a medical doctor the two senators met at the University of Minnesota Humphrey school on Monday with professor Larry Jacobs moderating\n... let me start with you uh we've had some enormous changes in health reform I think a lot of people or maybe just catching their breath after the Ford will CARE Act was passed by President Obama we've had efforts to repeal it and there have certainly been some\nProgram remains how do you feel about that program has just been you know kind of a landmark we should be focused on improving or something we need to kind of scrap these are from the\nBeginning I I'd say it's somewhere it's not the landmark program it's not the solution to things\nUm I was working are proposed Minnesota health plan about the same time of year before President Obama was elected and putting our thing out there and I suggested we need a fix to the problem not a tinkering with the problem and it was more than ... because it it did cut the insurance rates\nA number of people without insurance by half it didn't fundamentally change the system in a way that helps\nTake advantage of the excellent providers an excellent healthcare system we have and make it accessible to everyone we still have millions of people who can't afford any health insurance we have millions millions tens of millions hundreds of millions\nWho have insurance but they can't afford to get the care they need the co pays the duck doubles the lack of coverage for dental the lack of coverage for other things um so I I favored is better than what we had before as a state legislator I didn't have a role in it I'm In my pitch was let's not do it this way though let's actually fix it\n... and I'm here here we've got this new system that's rolled out Minnesota was in the forefront of implementing both the exchange which was known in Minnesota as mentor\nOr we also created what's known as the basic health plan which was our men care program and uh we've seen lots of expansion of\nThe uh medical assistance was expanded Medicaid program so lots of change um how are you feeling about where things are and and whether the Affordable CARE Act is you know the framework we should be kind of working on [noise] I think that the Affordable\nAct did bring some real positive to the to the marketplace if you will in the marketplace being marketplace of ideas\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoors through October and indoor markets open throughout the winter you can visit farmers' markets of M. P. L. S. dot org for mark at times I locations\nSome sort of elusive concept to me this is something I've addressed over the last thirty five years taking care of patients\nI've seen the six year olds come in with uh the diagnosis of type one diabetes\nSo in other words saying oh it's going to cost so much to do this yes healthcare is extremely expensive it's um it was one\nTwentieth of our economy forty fifty years ago now it's one sixth of our economy it's going to be one fifth of our economy some huge sector the economy and it's very expensive my argument is less expensive but we're doing now is the right direction is it\nVery affordable well it's more affordable than we're doing now and more affordable than the solutions others are coming up with because they're not coming up with solutions neither party is\nOther than a single payer system a single logical way to deliver health care neither party is coming up with him last year the Republicans offered for profit insurance companies into Minnesota 'cause that was going to solve the problem and so we allow them into the ...\nWell for profit insurance company can only meet its financial obligation to its shareholders by one of two ways maximizing profit either by raising premiums or by cutting benefits and neither of those are things we want to accomplish and healthcare so it seems to me that the ideas are being thrown out by the\nPolitical parties in the regular discussion aren't helping and that a single payer system\nLess expensive and we're doing now make sense\nI'm sending more you let me just get back to the nuts and bolts here because I think a lot of folks are attracted by the vision you're offering but are probably wondering\nWow how much would this cost Vermont which is for those who haven't been there it's in the northeast so liberal or state it's got this is where Bernie Sanders comes from a and in two thousand lovers have had a democratic\nLiberal governor and the Democratic liberal legislature they passed the first single payer law and they got to work and they made a very a determined effort to deliver the governor said we're going to leave the country and this\nAnd a twenty fourteen the same governor report it to the state he said you know\nThis was going to cost over a a several billion dollars we're gonna have to increase taxes payroll and other taxes and we cannot afford it it costs almost as much as the entire annual budget for the state\nSo how do you avoid that situation years you get a governor here in Minnesota you're leading majorities in both chambers and all these folks who are saying they support single payer actually vote for it are we heading for fiscal disaster\nA couple of comments when it first of all Vermont's wasn't what I Would call a single payer it was going to cover about a third of their population that's not what I Would describe as a single system covering everyone so they didn't get the administrative savings and other things like that\nIf a single payer system is less expensive and I'd be happy to go into why it should be less expensive even though we're covering more people for more things\nIf it's less expensive than we are already paying the higher costs now and how we structure the payments in a fair way is the logical thing to do so instead of paying your premium under our bill the premiums you'd be paying based on ability to pay\nI bet insurance company or through your employer they'd be paid to the Minnesota health plan does not stop if the government is not the government does not we at the legislature don't have\nWe spend that might well we need more money for roads your education though this money goes like Social Security goes directly to the fund that's going to pay off Social Security benefits I find goes directly to that you can only be spent on that\nAnd if the premiums that we pay so that instead of that if you call it that its own new government spending and then it costs more for government spending is less spending overall\nBecause if if he is less expensive which again I'd be happy to give the two biggest reasons is less expensive but if it is less expensive that means we're spending more than that now we'd be spending less to do it\nYou've raised a lot of issues and I want to turn to a center Jensen the give him his opportunity but before I Do I just want to ask you have you had a group of economists are others come up with some numbers on what your plan would cost has that happened\nWe have been asking governor Dayton actually was put in one year he put it in half million dollars to study this and another alternative proposal\nTo see how it would compare to what we're spending that we have not been able to do that I've been pushing legislatively to get that\nFor years the fact we're actually having debates and discussions like this now suggest we are going to get that to happen there have been a number of studies have single payer including in Minnesota they suggest is less expensive period but your plan has not been costs that outlined has not been cost it out and we're working on that\nSenator Jensen I'm curious if your reactions to a senator Marty's characterization of of affordability of single parent is\nHave Jacobs I ah I'm at the edge of my seat right now I'm I'm hearing that we're going to get everything and we won't pay more than our share and there's two ways that's going to make it affordable [noise] I don't want to make another comment without hearing those two things that will make this a what sounds like Pollyanna so if we could turn back to the center Marty I think that'd be great because I had to ...\nDown costs is through price negotiation sue fair pricing\nState of Minnesota to study and January they've been putting out numbers every couple of months they did it on simple ... replacement ranged from I think forty seven hundred dollars to\nForty six thousand dollar eight to one price disparity they found for simple knee replacement nationally two years earlier Yale study three four hundred was the cheapest one fifty five thousand eight hundred was the most expensive\nFor your math at sixteen to one price disparities the low in hospital is not losing money on that they set that price that's what they collect for the surgery they're not losing money on it they're making money\nThe one that's charging sixteen times as much for the same procedure\nIs making real good money and we need a logical system you can't buy one car and you go to one dealer versus another dealer and find sixteen hundred percent difference in cost you might say five or ten percent there is no logical price negotiation system in the current system\nThat's a huge cost savings there\nYou may not bring it down to thirty four hundred for every new replacement surgery but you're going to be stopping the bizarre situation we're in now and the second one is administrative costs and I'm not talking five or ten percent administrative savings in the simplest way to illustrate this maybe to talk about it in the allergy of\nThe way we fund our public schools versus the way we fund or hospitals\nIf we were to fund our school is way we fund our hospitals every teacher I have to calculate how much time he or she spent with every student\nHow many supplies they used on them send it down to the schools building office which would fall you know the administrative overhead the capital expenses that\nThe janitorial and supplies everything else utilities then they send out bills every month for the parents school insurance plans not these are expensive plans because education is extremely expensive so employers would obviously have to step in and provide school insurance coverage for their employees kids now\nCreate a market place for them and that's expensive too so we subsidize that and a lot of people even if they have the coverage that can't afford the co pays and deductibles so the school needs the collections agency to do that\nThink of all the administrative costs the school puts in place with is how much time waste that parents think of all of the school insurance plans and all of the bureaucracies they all have that's not a small detail that's a huge detail what do we do that to our schools I Hope not with a huge increase costs and take\nTime away from learning and put it into a building and collection you under eliminate that that's a huge savings and both of those two things those are the two biggest reasons there are thousands of little things in in pharmaceuticals\nOther things senator Johnson are you ready to respond I Am thank you I've seen a lot of people out there with paper and pencil so if you don't mind the ... I'd I'd love it if you just write some of these numbers down\nAnnually right now in Minnesota we spend approximately fifty billion dollars on health care\nApproximately six billion are spent by Minnesota on the MA play approximately six billion ... that's the medical assistance plan for mental level actually six billion is spent by the federal to support the medical assistance plan as well [noise]\nApproximately ten billion is spent on Medicare which is funded by the federal program but we get those dollars and we spend that out so we have ten billion six billion for him a Minnesota six billion for MA fed\nAnd then we have fourteen billion paid in premiums and then we have another fourteen billion and basically from coming from you folks deductibles co insurance says I'm Out of pocket payments if you will\nSo we have fourteen billion coming from the people fourteen billion in in employer premiums we have six billion to fund half of the medical assistance and others another six billion to fund the half because that's a fifty fifty split with the feds and then you have ten billion from Medicare that number comes to ...\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoors through October and indoor markets open throughout the winter you can visit farmers' markets of M. P. L. S. dot org for mark at times I locations do\nThese social inequities between how the health and wellness of one race or one group fair versus we're seeing the same thing with health partners in cargo right now in terms of putting together an opioid toolkit so we've seen innovation come from the private sector over and over again but\nLet's get back to the number let's say that the insurance companies are taking too much money that eighty five percent loss ratio which means that for every hundred dollars of coming in premiums they spend eighty five dollars to pay for services so they're left with Fifteen Percent in that piece of Obamacare let's see if we could cut it down by two thirds so ten percent comes up\nI'm just struck by the fact that we get so polarized I mean you're saying that there's broad based bipartisan support and yet if you actually go out and look at the data\nAs soon as you say to someone are you in favor of single payer that you get something like Seventy percent say and then as soon as you say now that would mean that all your health care would come through the government and you basically be in a situation like the VA or or or Medicare you Blue Cross would go away why don't want that\nI mean it changes when we start to define what we're talking about and that's why I think we really do need to define our terms\nThe single payer Canadian health care system is not single payer it's private insurers patients and the government to tune the Seventy percent Canada's got thirty one million people almost Seventy five percent of live within a hundred miles of the U.S border so they've always got that potential future system where they need to they can always\nThey've done that that are Canadian and they'll go down to dilute and get something done because they would've had to wait ten months\nIf the student state in Canada I had a patient in about a month ago came in those kind of a meat bought me a poster of what he saw because he was in Canada touring in the summer and he had a medical problem come up and so he went into get healthcare\nRight in their exam rooms they listed how long the way it would be if you needed an elected MRI it was going to be ten months before he could get your elective MRI so I think we really need to try to talk about the specifics\nIf I could get back to\nThe essential health benefits\nIf we're really going to bring commonsense health care industry is going to come from you folks it's not going to come from the politicians because we don't have the spine to make the tough decisions were going to bail 'cause we're always worried about the next election and maybe you won't send us a check I\nMean that's where we go it's really hard we need you folks to say I don't want that that Lipitor might sound find ... but you know I've seen the data and for every hundred people that take Lipitor really in a measurable impact only two out of the hundred will get a benefit\n[noise] why is it costs fifty thousand dollars to die in Dubuque, Iowa but two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to die in Manhattan New York it's because of the people it's because of this kind of decisions are making it's kind of advice or getting from the docks\nSo let me just stop you there because I think this is an issue you're both talking about\nRight through your both talking about the fact that there is extraordinary access a vet we're paying and this helps explain why ... why America is spending about Eighteen percent of our gross domestic product\nAlmost one out of five dollars and you're both pointing your finger at the prices that um the doctors in particular the hospitals are charging um and let's not forget the pharmaceuticals so is it possible\nIssue not say we've got to do the whole enchilada\nIs that kind of incremental approach a cause I think I think of I'm hearing Sen Jensen\nAccurately he's saying you know when I'm ready to roll up my sleeves I'm ready to kind of you know stand up to some of my colleagues have just say forget it we're not going to even talk about this but he wants to see something that's specific and concrete and not the saved a world approach\nI think we have some commonalities he wrote I wrote a book on health care he said he didn't agree with everything he wrote a book on health care doctor patient relationships I agreed with virtually everything in it\nBecause I think medical decisions should be I don't want a government run health care system I want a patient and Dr run healthcare system and I think the only way you're going to get that is to a system like this incremental approach I Want to make sure we cover everyone that's the bottom line\nI'm not willing to live without that I don't want to live with the system that says well we're going to let the citizens to be made by insurance companies are government or somebody else\nAnd when Scott when you talked about how you know well if you if you give it to people whatever they want they're going to be spending twenty thirty percent more\nI don't know where you come up with that number I haven't seen that in that in the academic journals of an hour's economic analysis of this bottom line is people do want more health care if they're not getting enough healthcare\nNobody wants more health care I don't know anybody in this room was gonna say oh I Love health care and it's all free you know I think I'll go get me another ... the next week there's some was\nCentered giants are ready to ask for senator Marty I applaud your ah your example of the call and ask me but let me give you another [laughter]\nMy parents died of it and so I probably would be one of those people that my wife is still the one that pushes me go get your call and ask it but I Do agree with you completely I think the moral imperative is that we need to provide some basic core package of health care to everyone\nWe're past discussing it\n[noise] but I think Iran in terms of human behavior\n[noise] and it's not bad but if you watch us when we go through a buffet line and we paid our ticket\nWe gorgeous shells and eat things to the tune that we would never do that I remember I went to this restaurant called ... child when I got done eating there I didn't want to see a a piece of beef for a year I almost got nausea driving by the countryside cnncom [noise]\nNo we do when we don't have to pay for our behavior changes folks we can honestly say that that isn't bad that's just too we are\nI have patients every day\nComing to the doctor what about a chest X ray and once you're listening well you know my mom used to get them because they came around to the neighborhoods and they took them remember mom getting a chest X ray and the neighborhoods in sleepy eye but the bottom line is if someone has a friend who wasn't a smoker and they got lung cancer\nOftentimes look and say you don't have the confidence been sort of nagging I think maybe a cat's gonna be a good idea when that didn't want your lungs are perfectly clear you haven't any weight loss you haven't kept up any blood\nIn Uganda medicine that causes a cough let's stop the medicine first and see if it goes away we have this our appetite is driven by the circumstances that govern our lives\nAs legislators were called to legislate including\nOur foibles as human and we haven't ourselves perhaps the first thing we should do is legislators should have the exact same kind of health care that you do and if we did\n[noise]\nThen maybe we we'd be more intellectually honest certainly at the federal level they have quite a health care plan I tell you I I Can't believe it but I don't think you can trust doctors like you used to be able to were too jaded we've jumped the Kool Aid you have to trust your own got liberty is not for everybody to see the article\nStore in people over the age of sixty five that don't have the diagnosis of diabetes or heart disease is not a good thing\nI got an article last week in the journal says does Lipitor help prevent the onset of dementia and I thought well this'll be government so I read the article\nIn the last paragraph sue well no it doesn't and never mind the fact that ... can actually cause a ... syndrome consisting of memory loss and confusion because if it does do they just stop and it'll probably go away [noise]\nThis is a kind of stuff and it does do Staten drugs causes diabetes yes we know what does you know what our literature tells us if I put you ma'am I'm Lipitor and that caused you to have diabetes\nAt that point in time you might say she was let's stop the Lipitor and see if the diabetes goes away no medical literature says I should up to ... because you know have diabetes and the standards for your ... your cholesterol measurements are now we have to lower lower now how does that and we do this every day\nSo you're part of the solution were part of the problem and you can't have it all is that simple\nSo senator just let me follow up with a one of the points that you've been gently making gently [noise]\nYeah I think even gently questioning\nOf the role in scope of government you've you've presented that in fact\nThe most graceful way I've heard from a Republican and some time and I appreciate that I'm so let me ask you this because we're now getting data we're almost two years into the Trump Administration and we're getting some data here in Minnesota the on insurance rate is up almost fifty percent\nAnd one of the things we're hearing from of those who are no longer insured which is over three hundred and fifty thousand Minnesotans who've lost their insurance is that they can't afford it that their coverage a has gone away\nWe've got to be careful here and government has a fairly substantial role to play here uh and that we need to be looking for ways maybe not to go as far as senator Marty but looking for ways to expand of the government involvement with regard to affordability and coverage\nThank you professor Jacob's that's a great question center Marty and I had a chance to discuss this issue on a different program probably six months ago\nAnd after that discussion on many of the points you made a really um pushed me to get more data and learn more so I called Stefan Gilda ... who works for the department of health and I said I Need to understand who these three hundred and fifty four hundred thousand people are in Minnesota that don't have health care what does it look like what what what's the face of these people\nAnd so he got me a probably five or six pages of the data and then I called them so let's go over it [noise]\nIt's more than half the people that don't have coverage in Minnesota right now are eligible we have to help them get signed up on the half say a hundred and Seventy five thousand that aren't there's at least a third of those probably could become eligible if\nWe tapped into all the sources we have so we're talking about literally less than two percent in Switzerland where they say they have universal coverage they call it Ninety nine point five so they're still short point five percent and were less than two percent in terms of if we could get everybody plugged in that's eligible", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Rochester", "day": "04"}
