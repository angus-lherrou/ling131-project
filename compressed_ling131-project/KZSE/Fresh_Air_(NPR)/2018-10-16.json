been like as a black woman to be an interracial relationships\nPhoebe Robinson welcome to fresh air it is a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago\nTen years in air okay okay I Know what\nWas the gender or race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you and then\nThink it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys so women some people color a few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there's just so way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience [noise]\nYeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that went anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really sort of posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can a curse is I I don't\n[noise] so when you weigh the discomfort of being like the only black girl and you're graduating class with the fact that you probably did get a really good education ... um how does the balance come out [noise]\nI think and I think it was worth it I Will say it would have been nice if there was\nAnother black girl\nMy great I think there was like one black girl in my class and there was one Indian girl and one Asian girl and I'm sure will be you know not to be like it's nice to have like a matching set but it would it be nice if we could have each like you know looked across you know during match and saw someone else who looked like us [noise]\nWhenever we talk about like representation like diversity I don't think

young black women talking about oh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like messed it up I couldn't talk about by black hair woes and high school with like Laura\nShe doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has to be flawless\nLike straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK\nWith being out numbered in a way and not letting that makes me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or\nYou know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows where you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're\nAbout body image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brand has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight dues and\nFor failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even in age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies you're still\nOh have you tried to overcome that 'cause it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place than you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that self dot com and so I think what I\nHave done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a skill in a house\nI make it is not about a number\nIf you're just going like

about\nMan is like your your amazing and then that would make me\nHappy life together and so that was one of the biggest lessons was like not looking for this great relationship to sort of define me
