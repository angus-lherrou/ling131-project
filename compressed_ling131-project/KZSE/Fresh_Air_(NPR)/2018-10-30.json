I was a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred it focuses on the story of Derek Black\nTheir ex father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and\nCreated the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an heir apparent in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties in a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with ... this morning\nSessler welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book ... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist\nUpside storm front he did not pull a trigger at the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find non blacks jewelry relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Ballard\nI think you can draw a straight line from Don's views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body he had attached to a fourteen eighty eight am to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what storm front does about um you know securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children at you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered them as the shooter in this case then when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is underway\nYeah the ... ... had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believed the Jews are committing genocide\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there and\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab and I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the message\nOne long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care of caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front\nTo the shooting at synagogue I'm In store front is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere is some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm fronts um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in in going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global is and that Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect but every now and then somebody's going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either gone or Darren\nYou didn't get the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken uh and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways ... and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into ... incidents like this and there was central to creating a phrase white genocide and said to popularize the movement to then ask somebody\nGoing to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's ...\n... is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek lack of former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\nProgram he supported my best for rumbling whose trial lawyers meet the legal challenges of a wide spectrum of corporate clients here in Minnesota and across the nation best word rumbling a fresh approach to an age old practice more best word\nDot com\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nGoing to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we noun sing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the list\nStorm front Derek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show\nI interview with black also included sass low the first question was addressed to Derrick black so you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national\nNot nationalism kind of turned it down to is like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by my race\nIs like yeah my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism in into that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that you didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was a not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know the early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best\nPeople and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insults where they live in a clinical word um\nLists all of our ... over\nThe years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing in and cause of separating or\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

something like that would be possible\nThe amount to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was happening because we were focused really intently on changing the language and I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said\nI find it really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism or white supremacy\nAnd yet there you were describing that you were trying to emphasize that\nImmigration would lead to white genocide\nThat white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against you\nSo it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and who they are exactly the in the in those was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section and that quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nGetting back to being attacked ... it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they're going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be quote unquote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents\nTrying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology and point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and you know racism nebulous thing fits that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining because\nA really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who is white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that\nSo the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come\nWhat is a white person even mean we're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post report
