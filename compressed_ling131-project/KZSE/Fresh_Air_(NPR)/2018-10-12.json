[noise]\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with ... other of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift and the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students said to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault but maybe it has to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you a grass on people in speech and make them feel like justice\nThat's I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line at about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\n[noise] so um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now as a yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to talk to somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown are pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is\nA really good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's in a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be

can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation and I'm just wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses\nIt's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is is empowering or is this\nDenigrating 'em and you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism item my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were

empowering to them now we have all sorts of data also saying that they have\nA huge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed disguised won't like their social media posts et cetera so there's there's a flipside to that\nThat they were adamant with me that this was only to the good that they were presenting themselves she reading her book we're in the process of developing new power dynamics in the bedroom an area where feminism has previously not been able to reach\nSo attached to explain what you mean by that I think this raising of demons that has been going on through the meat you era is allowing women not only to save these are the things that happened to me in the past that I might cause sexual assault or I might just called things I was
