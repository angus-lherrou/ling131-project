tonight at nine\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and they were\nSo it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject to virtually and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the campaign in twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time or a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered\nThen among us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the ... of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign but nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nTwo things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out but importantly it was not just winning out on line\nI don't feel decisions when you go back and map out the ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the\nPace of them essentially they change by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nOriginally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means in the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cause and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has ...\nOther militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist in an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in\nTaylor Swiss army of swift these you can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same\nBut the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you know giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at at crowd sources so to speak and\nOne of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise for\nA disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion\nTo drive it to your own ends the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's on line army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh as Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson breaking authors of the new book like war the weaponization of social media that is that about

W singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] I'm interested in your sense of how a social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nYou were watching your social media feeds during the cabinet\nOr going back and forth and uh it was in a certain way you had both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nThey wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh to a unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you had the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was now that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of burying the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again and again you saw both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate Bush you know all sorts of different false stories false persona is in the like\nAnd the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative be buried underneath as you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself or at least the online place that we go to a stylish and learn about history we ...\nSo for example in the book where the story of how after the Russians shoot down an airliner over Ukraine Russian um actors go on to ...\nIt seemed like they weren't involved the same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook it was sexual term\nAnd during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on wicked PTA or do you make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kinds of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies uh and they are now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just men back but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology\nSupport for NPR's brought you allow for a month ... intellectual property grip with offices in Minnesota and Los Angeles Inskeep IP Group aims to help companies leverage their power as patents to protect their innovation you didn't find out more at ... dot com\nThe future of marketing or it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same a chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on the war a certain way\nTo challenge also moves into visual imagery there's an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks are online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so so these neural networks like that could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane\nTo give real world examples of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich oh by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that and meld together to allow you to a in essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's gonna be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nEmerson broken ...
