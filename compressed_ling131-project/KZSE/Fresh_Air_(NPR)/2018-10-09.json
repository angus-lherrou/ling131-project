accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and I transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude who have the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the due to the this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nAppreciate you saying that as a son

about\nReading the poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book in observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time not with my meter now with my

to some of your father's most famous songs are already written and recorded by the time you were born Suzanne so long Marion here that's nowhere to say goodbye burn on a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear him a lot you do if you didn't meet me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters\nYou know I just thought about like what is the son and who's singing it um but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did and you must have grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course are her them you know I was a five year old and\nA far looking at it into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner of Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and scrap you record that's an amateur move\nSit amateur move he says yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um the love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but I was also about their intention out he was holding up the baton that\nHe had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah that baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember\n[noise] I'm In a relationship\nNow and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from them at all but just to follow her own whims and uh my father you know would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nVeto he's he always maintained a role\nUm in in our life despite my parents' separation ... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid he called it was like a like a jet stream kind of thing\nMhm yeah I remember my mother\nMoved my sister and I all the way to the south of France where we lived uh\nAnd it was a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things he put at the at the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead in his\nCare of in that fire\nHe did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's lives um the deliberate ... which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was hooked\nSomething really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own way as maybe responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm his reconnection to people um I ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father's savings and sold the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like stealing is sold to sell the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] [noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry um in incredible that [laughter]\nThat with the canon of his work with his devotion to black eating pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel them back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who
