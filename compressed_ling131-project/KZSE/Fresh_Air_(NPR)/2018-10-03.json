warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions of our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many

A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent\nOh it eats the Commerce Department and the national weather service titled National Weather service is a bit and now there was ever says the biggest part of Noah\nAnd how do they get their back in the seventies a Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and um he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior of the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department as an act of vengeance\nSo if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there and it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nA and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather prediction service well\nI'm so here's the problem are typically the person who runs NOAA has as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but\nBut the weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nUh all of that saves lives\nThat's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers\nA has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather can do it instead\nAnd that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress just actually forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place is the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to then give people forecasts\nBut what he's been trying to do is Oregon as a sexually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYou know you're saying that the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons are the high tech stuff that I'm\nThat no private company that no private company on us\nBefore that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a government operation to deliver weather forecast for the public so Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet my guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more

landing team led by Thomas Pyle the president of the American energy alliance which you describe as you know a group funded with millions of dollars from Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries\nThat basically represents their point of view so what was the landing team and what was pile tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who to prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listened politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were\nRunning department or jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um is part of the quote landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to somebody for questions to the department of energy [noise] what was the question\nWanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in and what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission\nAnd basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing ... because in some ways\nDepartments and you know in the Trump Administration are getting on ... because there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\nSo yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the ... people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that is there's a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident arrest of a terrorist attack or the one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium

United states has been actively engaged on these issues without regard to any proceeding before the icy Jay working closely with affirmative treasury to ensure that certain humanitarian related transactions involving Iran can and will continue\nThat said you were disappointed that the court failed to recognize that has no jurisdiction to issue any order relating to the sanctions measures where the United states ah which is doing its works on Iran to protect its own central security risks risk interests\nIn response to that the Iranian foreign minister took to Twitter to accuse us of

said uh you know it's a it's a defeat for a run not for us they again took the sort of narrow ruling as the evidence that the wider case against us sanctions\nUm it was they didn't have any merit and

that time a lot of people are thinking well maybe she's not perfect but time is running after a place where after all\nBritain is supposed to be leaving the EU next march\nShe seems to survive the competence then but I become friends even but the really hard task because you had to lie ahead\nI Would say so I mean she survived this but looking ahead she has just a matter of weeks now to try and get a deal with the European Union but she has\nSo little room to maneuver I don't think the u._s. gonna make many concessions because they see a divided\nWeak governments in the u._k. a divided country why should they make concessions\nBut she has little room to maneuver um she was to give too much away the fuse yeah stick breakfast isn't a policy wouldn't like it if she went for no deal the pro Europeans and businesses let's I Walk on of all you're doing so it's going to be immensely difficult to get not deal and then have to come back\nAnd sell it to a divided policy and like throw out one other focus come up from these conferences you know a lot of diplomats foreign diplomats from friendly country as has been a lot of them they were in Liverpool last week\nKnow you're the old country this is the this is the pull of this the politics of your country have gone mad so it gives you a sort of sense of the sort of ... ... email is if I say\nThank you very much rubbed she does realize I suppose that apple might suit or they had to kind of ... that people using their music being sued politicians but um we shall see wildly rub what's in opposition correspondent or from the latest from the Tory policy conference this is news now\n[noise]\nNow astronomers believe they found the first some evidence of the existence of an XO movie night some moon that old but it's a planet outside our own solar system\nThe team from Columbia University in the U.S had already use NASA's Kepler space telescope to study the premises of nearly three hundred planets that professor David keeping told me that use of the more advanced Hubble Telescope had been the game changer\nWe always thought they were very likely to exist because so many like ... solar system we see so many of them so I think the real question was not so much whether they exist at all but water that properties how big do they get\nWhy is it important to establish this\nInterested in ... for a few reasons one of them is that these moons could be habitable worlds in there and right I Would say that something that science fiction has a lot of something like that idea things like\n... and ... for example in Star Wars or near the idea is that maybe means my affects the habits of the of the time that that they are but we think the main does influence the U.S have seen in fact by stabilizing the liberty of thee for example\nAnd finally we want to understand how moons form when you really have a few examples in around ... system the moon appears like a maybe a one off event but is it maybe it's inevitable outcome a powerful nation by looking at the Nunes outside of our solar system\nHow these things are built in this place\nSuggests typically is there an assumption that if a plan that has the mood and going round it's at least one there is more chance to do that that might be life on the plan is\nNot necessarily but I think if we find another twin for example one of the questions you might ask if you're interested is how about the bill is whether it has a moon twin\nAs well for example what heights we near the ocean tides on the U.S had driven by the presence of the main and those early tied to specially when the main was much closer to us early in our history\nMay even ... played a role in kick starting life on a planet\nWhere is this possible first discovered XO moon\nIt's a long way away eight thousand light is are we weren't traveling that anytime soon missed\nOne of the most distant stars that kept to look at 'em and that's why it was so challenging for us to pull off this detection and why we needed additional tell us get time to do it\nRight the Hubble Space telescope enabled days did it\nThat's right there we throw a hint of their signature with a capital data we had three eclipse is of the planet in front of the stock three transits of the time in front of the stuff\nFrom that as we thought we saw a wiggle that could be a moon but we didn't have a conclusive evidence that points that we asked for time with the Hubble Space telescope which is more powerful space telescope and we're able to get a much more convincing sticking out of that\nYou must be looking for the tiniest ... said some way so distant\nThat sort of these that tiny sticking it says in ... we really see two signatures which give away the moon we can tell the planet comes into its eclipse ... about an hour to LA and that tells us that something is\nPulling on the planet gravitationally and we think that's the main and the second signal that we see is a ... in the brightness of the style which has caused by the moon passing in front of the style the shadow of the moon if you like in front of the south so these are tiny signatures that we think we have strong evidence for them\nIs this thrilling possibility of extraterrestrial life that that most people have felt at some stage in life something that actually\nIt's always been the last ... and point of this end up a woman looking for planets lacking some beans I think a fundamental question of fundamental driving force behind why we do this has to understand a uniqueness in the universe how unique this solar system and indeed ourselves um said to me looking for life on these worlds one day is the final part of that\nQuestion [noise] professor David keeping from Columbia University telling us that are
