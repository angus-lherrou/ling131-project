into rehab right\nMost places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy in some states it's really complicated you have to judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that I never had to\nKind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he'll be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks but\nUm I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other ways but\nWhatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes Nick would just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he he just wanted to\nGet off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know drive you a treatment center check you in\nAnd so he would do it um but as things went forward I mean the last time that ... you know he's been sober for a long time it was after ... can I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of like it and I took one I thought to myself just one\nWhich is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us\nAnd soon the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week so he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the ...\nA day to me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in a freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so so when they got in that play on that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so ah\nIt shows that it's possible I mean people think that treatment can't work\nA Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit about twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in a twelve step program\nIs probably going to you know a a twelve step program for parents Ellen on yeah yeah and then you visited them just just research for the book do you see you see you know positives and negatives with the twelve step program\nToo I think most people know what the positive\nUh parts are but what are some of the problems you have to stop\nTwelve steps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but\nNot most people and that's the problem I have it's not what the twelve steps it's lonely many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem so my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced\nNick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embrace the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative\nBut I did go to Alan on meetings\nAnd what I found there was something different that helped me you know when they became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I I was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people telling me over and over and over again\nGo to Ellen on meetings got Allentown meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and saying I'm not going into one of those rooms where people are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt\nYou know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on his face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling as when I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretty tense and those rooms there was this openness it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the day's\nLesson on a positive note [laughter] and and if it's OK ... if not prying into your son next privacy he sounds like he's doing really well now professionally as well as person that just gives all update on his life is that's not prying too much\nIt's it's not I mean this is really you know I think he's great country
