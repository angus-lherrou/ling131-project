world small world yeah [laughter]\nThe Syrian story there are a couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\nWe just want to say just one of the opportunity to win together and we didn't have to hang together but I mean we didn't even have the chance for at least originally we did a\nSicilia want it to run on the homecoming court as again but the school administration told her that only boys can be teens and only girls can be queens to go to and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually\nWin together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day they decided to have no gender titles in the home coming contests no canes know queens everyone on the homecoming court would just be known as quote royals but that didn't make facilities in story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it's another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples\nStory how do you feel about this\nThink they were over compensating rather than just your day and that well it shouldn't have ... ... ... they should have just made it so you are voting ... regardless of their doctors that church whether or not that we're now that the same\nOr ... or anything between and it was up to that it wasn't up to school because they weren't going to take out come on circuit check out check your guest one couple wants to run together\nQuote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as algae be teach you plus since the change the sodium story happened dealing with the fallout\nOther students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like the new policy it isn't what home coming as a post ... about\nUm outside Austin ... glitter hearing about it the common core I turned out very positive\nWhat's been the worst kind of comments\nThat originally ... saying that we're that we're not washing our place in the rational special treatment and that is exactly what they would have expected to electing checks how far is that they were really how come perfect yeah\nPeople really think is going to ruin homecoming ... ended up taking away the whole homecoming tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for others senior year traditions as well like is there gonna be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next guy\nYes actually that's one of the teachers that has been talking to us throughout this whole issue mentioned right off hand in ... she was like and I can't wait for like we get to ...\nYou say running for John King and queen ... now my goodness so there may be more drama I had before the years done he hasn't fully [laughter]\nThese two young women says so\nStudents support than others don't like the outcome the votes actually aren't done yet that's going to happen next week but this story really made me think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have the school administration that is trying to in some way be an allied to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think\nWe're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be confusing for some people\nI can get that get behind that random friday night meeting ... my horn before I get\n[laughter] um you know what this means show us\nWhy my grand prize of nothing not even a crispy cream that might be around\nWith that um this portion of the show was over and I'm going to say
