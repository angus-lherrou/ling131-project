R. go dot com\nAssistance set their bosses up each other\nAnd we need to miserable people\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girl private love letters were mysteriously males to Oliver crushes I think it's really cool that you think I have quote inspection my eyes\nThe letters and then there was this\nOther one where the bride got left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her estranged father\nThat incredibly drunk that night and I am black became [noise]\nThat's what the grammar hunting though the fun thing about all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up to all the boys I've loved before and like father have you ever watch any of those\nMovies ... okay which took I watched um televise before of course so good and set it up yes letter I so love lovely\nFeel retro that I feel like it stokes that particular part of my heart same same\nSo these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get the scribe has to watch romantic comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of love very closely her name is Gwen\nAvi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good I'm thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me cigarettes and yet I have been kind of\n... out for several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer\nI Know you didn't even now [noise] um\nThey called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nOh yeah the summer of love was like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer a that as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million\nViewers watch and it's not even number of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you can even multiply that number\nEight eight million people watching his rom coms my big question and first question about all of this was like what led Netflix no or think\nThat rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take the rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix say well this might work for us\nThink they just spied on completely underserved market\nYou know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd and comic book club shoots yeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity or so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want like just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you kind of out of luck\nSo for Netflix it's kind of a combination\nAre churning out these rom coms are also tagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used\nAnd it's worked out really well for them\nYeah why have the big movie studios at the movies in theaters widely left rom coms\nWrit large I think they're ah they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more Brazilian dollars back\nGym with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when you grand and Julia Roberts you could just basically put the ground with anybody like let's move on to build up next why not\nBut then you have something like Reese Witherspoon and Vince vaughan and for Christmases and the tank and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband than to go on to see a movie that's you know romance themes like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again like it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms honor and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do it's been twenty dollars and see a lovely couple ended up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night\nShould we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more wrong comes in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I I Do wonder about that because I mean crazy Rich Asians did so well because we just want a you know a lovely\nMovie like that to see you later and in the story that I wrote another thing that was really prevalent we had a ton of commenters\nFrom the corporation for public broadcasting in the state of Joan crock who's ... serves as an enduring investments in the future of public radio\nAnd from the John s and James L night foundation helping NPR advanced

sexual abuse of minors probably not good for kids we've discussed the me too movement a lot on the show me too and politics me too in Hollywood be two in journalism and\nNPR's newsroom even now we're going to talk about me too and sports and the dozens of stories you've been hearing for months about young elite athletes being abused by their coaches the doctors the mentors people they should be able to trust\nThe reality is causing a great deal of physical Nashville and unless you know pain he never healed me he took advantage\nGold medalists alley Raisman she was speaking at the trial of Larry Nassar he was convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women under ... care\nAs a former sports doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State university ... Nassar was recently sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison in the wake of massive trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job and were less than a week today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of sexual abuse in another ... former speed skater Brady barrel ... she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager and\nSo he helps drive my teammate and I to and from practice which both of our family is really appreciated and so and he would only pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to\nThe rank and scape but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rank and skate then there was molest station that happened before and after I mean in the parking lots of high school parking lot\nRight he was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year old Olympic medalist Andy Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brought his mentor and helped her family out\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I home from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first\nThen I mean I can picture clear as day back out of our driveway go down the street stops I'd take a right and you go to my house and it was like that every time and then one time at that same stops on he took a left and he went to the um a few streets over and there was a dead end\nWhich in hindsight it's interesting that he knew that there is a dead end there there is a dead end he pulled the car or\nThat can I guess you would have had that moment I said nothing I just sat there and\nUm I Will sit here and honestly say I did I say no I did not open the door and not run away\nBut I was frozen\nYeah I mean people say there's fight or flight but there's freaks and that's what happened and I remember after that when we put our seatbelts on and turn the car around I remember just being like pick a fog or a\nI mean now now we have an especially I was like W ATF yeah you know and run shock probably ... percent\nAnd only ... how would I tell anyone who would believe me what proof have\nWhy would anyone\nBelieves that he would do you know I mean just [noise]\nUm and it wasn't violet\nIn what we think of as traditional violence so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan you know all that that we pretend to make these people will be so [noise] yeah that I mean honest to God that is the day my life changed\nHe would keep doing this in the ... the the contact become more intense\nBut yeah so so people will say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to\nAnswer that awkward question on any I never had sex\nAnd the traditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was wrecked um [noise] and he or touch and found on me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy is taking it\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from your age or go healthcare

not know how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean\nI think it it was such a time of\nConfusion and\nI was so dedicated to wanting to skate that I didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have\nAny anything to barter I didn't have money I didn't have 'em anything the only thing that he wanted for me was my prediction doesn't fly body um and\nUm I thought it was it so confusing because like I said he wasn't violence with me and\nHe took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming Amir blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there's something there not straight they're bent to go left and the offset\nAnd so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement Curtis is pretty

so he helped me out and a lot of ways when my mother said if you want to go to a skating find a ride to the rank and Andy what's my ride [noise]\nDo do you think she ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen that he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because I didn't know what else that could be yeah yeah because he was kind to me in and gave me\nThings um you know bought me things about me gifts brought me out to dinner I mean it's the things that seems silly and trivial to someone like just stop for a second\nI I didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere I'm I\nWas mowing lawns and the summer well that's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had to contribute [laughter] it's not inappropriate for kids to kiss and fool around and experiment when they're Fifteen with other Fifteen year old kids yeah right right\nSo that's what was so confusing about at all also took was part of the reason it took me so long to come forward and talk about it because\nFor so long it it was and it still is it's gray two things one so again I was in the tenth grade and that was when we had homecoming dance and I want\nLived down the street from Andy one block away and and he said that I could quote go he let me go I'm so long as as soon as I came home I called him I couldn't go down after party I can go to anything I had to come directly home\nAnd so I told the group of friends I was dying laughing my day and ever and I said I you know I have practice in the morning so I'm just after the dancing and I go home and I was like oh that's cool yeah we figured out fine but it was because he was controlling yeah yeah well I told my parents my only pick me up you know the station ... station wagon\nA rolled into the school parking lot to pick me up and brought me home and no one thought anything of it and I have one of those\nMemories in my brain\nOf being in my bedroom had twin beds in my bedroom and this yellow\nBedside table between the two of them in this phone was there and I remember being kind of under the covers and no one can hear me picking up the
