things with a woman\nWell society has a pretty big problem with it you know there there are a lot of people out there who think people like me are sick\nSo I mean coming out has been a thing at this point for a few decades ... the backlash that she face ...\nWas pretty ... lost his show all these conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads on the show on ABC actually put an adult content warning on episodes of Ellen that showed a woman kissing a woman\nThat if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine area and I'm so in April Nineteen Ninety seven [noise]\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Alan a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the good characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people and of course a lot of gay people are like that but not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids\nOr you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there is no right and wrong in this issue of the only right thing to do was embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible bigots wow\nWow [noise] it's so funny she says there's an agenda to normalize homosexuality it's like\nYeah yeah yeah there is a partner [laughter] the whole he hate kids it's okay you can try to uh it was fascinating to hear because that's of course what they were terrified about it it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um\nAnd I I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly and can I jump up and I know we're going decade by decade I'll do it go ahead but you know I ... for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it\nI'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleventh\nIs when it appeared and um and he sets off a rain blow flag waving firestorm really of protest when he says don't come out he said people like clear people stopped coming out and do we get back on from Nineteen Ninety seven\nTwenty Seventeen Twenty years later we don't do it academic they don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay\nSo for one and this is debatable\nAmerica this is a quote America's a safer place in twenty Seventeen he on people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm\nI'm paraphrasing he's you know we have to proclaim my sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it but they don't wear as blank heterosexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out or no one should\nMaybe heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that are ... new way to organize our judgments about people\nAnd that no particular sexuality should be the expected default\nSpeaking of the ways that things have just become more fluid I'm thinking of the ways that celebrities come out now you know and you think an R. and B. singer Frank Ocean and she came out but he never use the word gay might you know you think about Jodie Foster Amos the kind of came out the globe's we actually have paper\nThat you know I'm just going to put out there right loud and proud right so I'm I'm In Egypt report on
