Saturday\nJoining me to discuss the report and its potential fallout is NPR Justice Department a reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan welcome thank you so we have this report or will the Senate has the report now or do we the people had any idea what he's actually contained within the four corners well\nWe don't have any sort of specific snow and this is certainly something that is confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public a despite clearly a\nFair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there of what we do know is that publicly at least\nA six people have confirmed that they spoke to the FBI many of them are people who are friends of judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim gone debt and Chris Garrett\nOr as well as one friend of of Ford's that's legal in Kaiser who all confirmed that they spoke to the FBI and then there's a second woman who made allegations of sexual misconduct against cabin on that's ever\n... now a NPR has learned um that\nUh nine people according to a to a an official nine people spoke with the the FBI in total um but again a lot of this is\nOne that you know we don't know what all the FBI was told in this uh and likely we're not going to get a full picture but what we do have so far as what a chairman Grassley has said and that is that there's nothing in there that the committee and the public of this one didn't already know so\nWhere is the report right now physically I mean how our senators looking at it because it's extremely sensitive every reporter in Washington wants to get a look at it and and every political operative does too\nWell uh the process for this is governed by a memorandum of understanding that uh dates back round a decade

T.\nUm he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the bt far less though he's not he's a moderate um let the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFormer president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stance so the party at south now is very much hard left um the candidate though is that\nUm that being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow\nUm is this anti PT vote so these elections are very strange because they have become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not you know I see as friends\nAnd we're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls of what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary and uh the size of in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the vote or show up or we may have less of a proportion this time or\nOne important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because it's\nIt's a fifty percent of the valley of devotes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we'd both from winning more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff but the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or\nRegardless if they are the less from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there is not going to be a military coup in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics now\nBrian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an hour oh has a history of violent rhetoric has been photographed waiting machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers or thieves\nBeing shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was actually stabbed at a campaign rally or what happened there and what happened since how has it affected his standing among voters in Brazil\nIn a way I mean it was I think all of us were paying to see a political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both in our own he he almost\nDied by his own account and and those are the doctors that treated him politically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful um because the plan by the more centrist candidates in this race was to spend\nThese last couple of weeks attacking both scenario as much as possible and on TV ads and elsewhere and and because of this attack

International Center and you had been sending us your messages won a listeners\nDrew emails I was in northwest Brazil last month staying with a gay black friend he is all in for ... people are so fed up after the carwash scandal they will go for anything that isn't part of the Workers Party\nNow Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash and abroad offensive corruption scandal\nI don't want to mix metaphors but I'm older will have all the cars been overturned it opened up and cleaned out in a car wash well it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred well let me go back in time just a little bit because it is important to put into context shootings\nThe most important um findings of lovers out two or of car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen\nAnd at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen and two was president at the time [noise]\nUm she was impeached in twenty sixteen and part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of her of her coalition and her her coalition had\nUm a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash\nFindings in the car wash probing the plea bargains 'em and everything else that started to come out publicly in terms of this particular investigation\nShe was she ... she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing um but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because\nThe the impeachment that\nShe suffered was really very much politically motivated by the need that some of these political parties in her coalition had\nTo try to at least slow love our job to if not stop it all together and this is a very important element when we look at the degree of polarization that currently exists in Brazil\nBecause the people who still defend the workers' party instilled defend the P.

United states up Paolo Matt makes a good point Brazil was celebrated\nAs the rising star not only of Latin America but of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top\nAre now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was to Brazil that debt hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country predestined to be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country or one of the major betrayal says the size of the workers bar to bar too that was led\nBy a man born in poverty or that or a bill this very successful party on initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil\nA ... a basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics big producer of commodities had a wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well\nA than reality hits\nA ruler made a very bad choice and his successor a and a a lot of a shot to came and the magic would disappear or what\nAnd this is what I think what they should be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems this crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are and another thing that a sport they shouldn't be positive is the fact that the state and Brazil is basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money uh all that dream now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be confronted from eight to ... reality ... basis where the government has run all the money we have to adjust the economy the measures necessary to do that are very\nOff an unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly why how they plan to go from ...\nNow Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Bryan that you recently wrote where you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion\nWas too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion well if\nYou look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be an inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program [noise] feel like they're voting against\nSomebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences\nOf that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned tied the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in their system of government\nIs just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen this happen in places like turkey in Hungary in ...\nRecession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this corruption scandal\nThan virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the Pew\nResearch Center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turn that could involve the curtail moment of civil civil liberties and and and other things\nI I in my time I'm this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile I guess just blew me away I mean it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous\nPeriods of military rule Nineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that that was a real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and\nYou know maybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right now\nWill Brian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilian say representative democracy\nIs the best form of government now I'm an right to the point is ... emails us why are we so concerned about the right versus the left in Brazil both ... is another ... he's an air to want a ... a Kim ... all these dictator dictator wannabes who
