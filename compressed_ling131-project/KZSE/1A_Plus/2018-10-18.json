mild mannered you know people have described them as two of the really nice guys in their respective political parties very non controversial or they disagree but often respectfully on a number of issues I'm On the other side of the state we have\nIncumbent democratic congresswoman any ... this is her third term in the house and I this election is largely being framed as kind of a referendum on

one at a at W. A. M. U. dot for the call I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nYou know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics and the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of it not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts\nAnd going as hard as they can I Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest\nFor a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest or seeing high turnout in primaries and in special elections\nAnd you know frankly using Democrats really fired up to vote against the president and we've seen that according to a few sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all ... Texas focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and are particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home and I'm an off year or mid term year and there's a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latinos African Americans and Asians who are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and midterm years\nIs there are certain benchmark Warner for what\nA blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the Democratic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house blew but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue wave crashing over a pick up some ten seats or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three out turning the the House bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as it a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou have this idea of a blue way was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling water some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public falling a shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least those twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive\nThe way we do that is you so call one eight hundred to two seven twenty eight eleven or contribute online it's very easy MPR news dot org

P. R. dot org let's get to some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website in the front page does not see what they are for does not tell me what they care about\nOne summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up to the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nI think what Laurie is pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that and number of the conversations I had\nI have recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to make sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking about or is that are sending out mailers are going and knocking the people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure that they're telling voters that they have a message that they are running on\nAre about just running against President Trump's\nBase um I was talking to some groups that did some field testing recently among Latino voters and they said ... and when they get this field testing\nThey were saying people were turned out they said if they got to try mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump space on it they be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that match and you talk about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about health care message I think is Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we can follow up on that theme was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what John left in our inbox\nIssued John rave share to New York so often on the shows people for the Republicans the Democrats or Republicans the Democrats the Republicans would\nInstead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for such a threat to\nThe Republicans that stand for such and such it helps educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stands for ... I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done\nThat to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad brush yeah I mean we have to\nShe was and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did or regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example or by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party and twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advised to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a\nAs an Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and it really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do a it is a memorable\nAnd it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here ... years [laughter] it's funny to do\nYou will never be unemployed not ever their medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... out L G beach acute candidates running some of ...\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered to stand those strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think a lot of Native American candidates or you know just to New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man or he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire Democrat now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump was elected and when we talk about when and where I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women who have been nominated\nFor ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three has been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running ... that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo it'd be I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic woman who'd been nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right and the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearings\nHad been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll and you know they are going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nThere are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between here and send them at the Democrat and Martha McSally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that\nYou see this as a bipartisan trained we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense that both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates a certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A
