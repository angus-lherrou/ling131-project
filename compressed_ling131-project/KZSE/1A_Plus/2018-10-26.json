President Trump sent troops to the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the ...\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruined was pointing out to apply of thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping or countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking\nStates on their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives\nIn the United states they think that that children would have better lives and really there is no greater testament to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the to the United states and settle\nDown and have children and have better lives of sensibly and and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump Ian ... and I guess Republican rhetoric\nThat play into the the idea that the migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in ... in fact a you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they are anything but\nAnd I also do want to point out a curve ruined mentioned that President Trump alluded to the ... a A R mentioned that uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly\nHe was using um Middle Eastern as a slower of sorts which which\nWhich are Evelyn we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry is aimed for the country\n... that's exactly right thank you for the car for vacation there but the the point I was getting too was that the use of the of of a Middle East and as the um ... is extremely dangerous because it it it it then tries to create the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at as carbon was pointing out again a movement that happens very often\nParts of the world often try to make their way to the United states and the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now the numbering into thousands is because it has been politicized here and the United states\nMichael Goldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful\nWith the language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help a cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them blamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government\nAnd dug in Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter\nNow Michael Merriam Webster is might go to in terms of the English language\nMerriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\nYou know John it was as you've been talking about this I I suddenly had Woody Guthrie's old song\nAbout about a group of migrants being sent back to Mexico in the Nineteen thirties and their plane crashed\nAnd they were called deportees it's a beautiful song you you look it up and I mean listeners should should strict YouTube after the show and and give it a listen there are many versions

R. go dot com\nRough draft of history the host and creator of that podcast where we let me come to you wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer to the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex with the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nThought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't say in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's bad because I mean while he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the ah the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some for some form is is on its way it's coming and so at some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it will entail\nAnd and ... and and I think what cook has tried to do in this speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen\nAnyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support is a of a potential data privacy laws in the United states\nYou are as the general data protection regulation it's there's\nA new area law that protects the privacy of data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the e you if you've noticed re in the last few months\nThat a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we may be tracked your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist mistreatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nOf the ... privilege to name for the green as the individual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of his story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord pain or Baron the hand of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privilege to name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nSuch a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example of clear example of a very significant differences between\nFree speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of it just for ... in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is pretty unique tool\nOur lament that you can't say outside and and not so for any libel actions and Peter hand was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph\nThis this guy a full of green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to bite Tony Blair for services to retail is set up\nA series of of um clothing shops over over the decades and made himself very very wealthy and indeed and um apparently he was just the kind of ball she would expect you as a bully and he was\nHe sexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up\nThere were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements\nAnd the difference of course is that in the U.S New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that and you know the details who can't get because of these non disclosure agreement so at least we know his name and here in Britain it's something else it\nWas you know and moving oh go ahead Michael go ahead no no because I could go on about this guy forever and I was [laughter]\nWe appreciate it on\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to say to have that that this this question of like which is the greater good here right because this is at\nThe meeting them and it's already been a question of can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against a big powerful wealthy usually male and in player who's pulling things at ... ... ... doing things that they shouldn't be doing but because of power and\nI'm In Flint is able to get away with that it it kind of the perfect I'm ... and ... it's kind of the perfect at ... I guess to see what is\nWhat society kind of values protecting more is it that reputation everyday accused in this way where India is can be applied newspapers that one\nAnd it's out in the public space and so there's like an extra level in the u._k. and determining you know how much of a\nOr international conversation I guess at this point all of this is going to be in terms of does one wrong done effect you know an entire society and and how shall be sorted out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections what Brazilians are focused on a presidential election they have to the polls on Sunday to choose between two radically different candidates in the second round of voting\nFor ... on the left ... is on the right in ... the lead in most polls many expect him to win the election joining us now from Sao paolo is Sarah ... who is Brazil correspondents for the economist Sara welcome to want to\nThank for having me\nRemind us about ... he's been pretty controversial explain to us why\nWell NATO has been a congressman for a couple of decades now and has really become a formal or ask for any particular\nLike I say that that are more for days at a tiny screen as a friend of his comment and a winning and are minorities and burn and go on and ... even when they're\nVery provocative back in ... that a lot of people to compare him to come by its own otherwise when I was very ... acre acreage so\nI'm kind of like ... bucks a pack up as an outsider or you're on when they're like that around ... got a kind of hoping that it's so cold that any of the country back on TALK\nIs that why he is so popular I mean you know the Brazil has had a number of issues that kind of a cascading issues with corruption over the years is just kind of she's outsider status has eclipse any\nMaybe about him\nI'm there I'm I'm a ... he would\nUm Ramon quote ... me and I've heard about a year last week on high end the call but\nEveryone looks at it I think that anyone if it'd be kind of lost touch", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "26"}
