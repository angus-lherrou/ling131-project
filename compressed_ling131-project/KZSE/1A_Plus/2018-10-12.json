from our friday roundtable archives about author Mary Shelley and her novel Frankenstein somebody tweeted me here to say that\nCan Russell's gothic is about the four author's coming together and coming up with their book so that sounds like a really cool movie about what we're talking about here so we talked about technology we talked about how these authors approached this writing\nAnd some of their excitement and their worries still resonates today here's what Heidi bird an actor with green tea productions had to say about that\nAnd how interesting is it to you that we have while it's not pre determined we have been talking about or at least people were talking about technology\nAble to do these things in your pocket and Nikola Tesla talked about how you'd be able to be on a boat in the middle of the ocean and take something out of your pocket and read a newspaper I'm from anywhere in the world a citizen the the ideas are knew what I think it's fascinating is how we go chasing after these ideas\nAnd sometimes our discoveries and our changes that technology and science both make our steps\nAnd the general public and people who don't understand what you're doing in a scientific setting are comfortable with steps\nIt's when we make these big jumps ... that we can't easily understand now that big jump really benefits me like we went from you know a dumb phones to a smartphone and that's super benefits me so a plus to that big jump um but if it's a jumped up\nWe in fact three D. print 'em a an organ in Oregon where a gun yeah yeah um and have it be something we can put into a human body and work well now we start to have questions about what are the ramifications and that's where the talks about ethics come into play\nBut the entire conversation we have to look at not the ethics necessarily if the sides of the technology but the ethics of the people at the over arching perspective the science and technology don't have\nEthics the people using that unlike our good doctor have the ethics and he's not a very good doctor but [laughter]\nYou know they had the ethics it's their ethics you need to be talking about and and concerned with and the culture drives that\nThe culture states who were supposed to be how we're supposed to be um there were times when\nA religion was a big factor for a lot of people in determining what that is now we have a mixed bag multiple religion in this country um and multiple levels of engagement with that and so it may be less of a of a unified driving force on at once was\nSo now we need to talk of ethics because they're right not because theyre prescribed yeah so ah how do you I saw you kind of nodding in agreement when I said Hollywood has done us no favors where if the movie's gone wrong\nThey have very little relationship to the book uh it was the where they normally go wrong in Hollywood I'm\nIn the Nineteen thirty one a movie is the biggest misstep and there are many but the biggest is the\nBlaming of the creatures behavior and the creation of the creature as a monster on an abnormal brain or brain of an already evil person right which it he was born evil born evil which is of course\nRidiculous and not at all what Mary was saying not ... ... they they just\nSomething that could tell it a fascinating story that was real and terrify as opposed to actually tap into the stories that and and the important things she was trying to get across with a novel in my opinion does anyone here think there is a good film representation\nOf it no I haven't seen you know it's been a while since I've seen isn't there one with Robert De Niro and it's been a while since I've seen that so I it's low sir it's it's it pays more\nOf a um it was more of its story to the book certainly but the creature doesn't he's not sympathetic he's not sympathetic still on which is what is missing and and it's that sympathy that we have for the creature that allows us to become better people after reading the book um in sight seeing seeing ourselves in something\nUm that is other than ourselves and his hated and lows didn't and it gives us empathy for those things that others might be hating and losing for reasons that pass understanding to us it opens our empathy channels on them without that it's just not the story it's just not the ... just a monster store just a monster

Shane Harris and Todd's will still time to get into more of your questions and thoughts on the week's top stories won a asked W. A. M. U. dot org Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go\nSeems to have had office it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides all around what I'm about to say\nAh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now is having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state\nActually had a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat to now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have six\nRepublican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it's had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nOr you know lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house\nMost likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January they will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like Shane said before they\nWill become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee\nRuns the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator tumbling Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary can name but she's also in the homeland security and government affairs\nTo grill FBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in this supplemental background check will also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up so she's up for reelection\nYou can bet that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say is she just last night um was trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that Trump is trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real store and in from outside the White House just put forces three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on them she's very upset about that and Trump\nAt times to administration really breaking from tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these ...\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics for the roundup is up but a few more things out of D.C we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just miss swift\nFor endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee but he woke him Tania was to the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're going to lunch with her to adults who are well worth it I don't want to put you in this job as far as the guy who does this guy [noise]\nI Love this guy is really\nKony was was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like ...\nPresident needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear of those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he admitted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I I think it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to dig through these deep and it's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching his head about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him a it was just a very strange moment and I know for for for for me and my colleagues who just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note that ... old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week she endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate\nProgramming is supported
