A. M. U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and the military and give us a sense of what that is in a nutshell\nWe already are familiar with the role that other scientists have played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that was first showed up on the battlefield what an asymmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you were in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call that an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the new book of\nOf Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a mastermind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army so and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of that scientists engineer and an artist\nBut moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who built the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the ... you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they would you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAnd the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association because we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy and then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military it just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days astronomers have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision around the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky and to to know the night sky and on\nAnd it's for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky will just different depending on where you are on earth and things rise of different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where it where the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over it\nI should know we didn't have a conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one egg you can find that conversation on line at the one eight dot board\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for the summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth plant since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of graphic within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have\nAccomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people and humanity\nSo first of all just to do the space where there's not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the U. S. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs there was consolidation in the industry there was competition from Europe with Airbus and other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets so there was a concern\nSri ... what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce you order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're\nRight or at least to the nearest airport [laughter] step doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but\nWe would call them drones I guess [laughter] but so so you you ... when you look at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns of space 'cause these are the same companies\nAerospace companies that that became a word right and if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities of the military it's called the U.S air force base command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space worse separate from what's already happening so I was I get a second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nA bit if you just listen to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there we went to we don't wanna just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just mean\nYou think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than seeing the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nThe same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force and slide them out under one umbrella one sort of coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroids strikes and then the limit it could render us all extinct as one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all\nSpecies of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survive ability right of of of the ... that requires the sunlight to feed it so so space force\nWould might include I by the way I Would also throw in your clean up the debris it's up there while you're yes the space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace it's very hard and not particularly strategic\nTo make space and at the repository of weaponry\nHolding aside the fact that that would violate a treaty to which we are signature and today more than a hundred countries or sign\nIs also her first visit to Africa a spokeswoman says the first lady's exchanged gifts a gift to the White House straight and assigned letter to use

see how many of these we can get through in the time that we have left Eli wrote on our Facebook page that she's a big fan of yours Eli writes I have a job\nDo you have any suggestions on how I can slam dunk this thing it's my dream to be able to work at NASA\n[laughter] [noise] I think in this kind of in the world of of\nUh exploring the frontier and not only a strong resume matters but uh inter personally enthusiasm ... I think really matters\nThey want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and you're you're you have spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all that your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure\nThat we're all partake in in the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in the basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I eat a robot body transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\n[noise] ah so first of the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions is also reducing very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing to put a human brain into a robotic chassis\nUm when you could program the robotic ... to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put put to to put our consciousness I live here I think that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nA evidence of that is how many books are still written on it there's evidence that usually you don't know what it is for example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity there's like three books we got grab it we're not still writing books on its alone is just the law yeah obey gravity\nSupport for NPR's ... by the law for another ... intellectual property that with ... Minnesota in Los Angeles Inskeep ... aims to help companies leverage their power of pop ... to protect their innovation you can find out more than ...\nWing brain what I really want is if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a oh last at least find a way to transplant the brain of an Alzheimer's patient into the body of I'm\nI'm not sorry the brain of an ale less patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body odor you lose your your mind\nIs that this sounds very altered carbon even lost a lot of mental exam\nIs very Frankenstein to ... I just said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant of brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly helps though is on wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is there's there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and you scoop out some water and they analyze the water really carefully insect\nThere no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nNo you haven't looked the arts so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life are intelligent life uh\nFor example um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who study the problem is in no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends now considering a possible\nThe influence [noise] we're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because\nThe more dangerous than asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it as the easier it is to detect so so uh I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comet could come from out of nowhere because comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but it I regardless you want a healthy space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding protecting having insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating thing that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over nature and heed the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be\nFairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have then many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of you know today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful I'm realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm I'm ... I'm I'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right the woman ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil in green\nProgramming is supported by narrow a new kind of precision pain clinic that pinpoints paying at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing narrow clinics dot com world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and these this topic story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ... I've seen people bounce back societies bounce back ... people in power bounce back\nSo how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth and he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back him so I that's why I think we'll be okay Jared submitted questions through our app won a vox pop\nDo you think that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe if not what's the timeline to solving say something like\nMatter the question Jared Neal is so I think about that all the time I lose sleep on whether it's slightly rephrase the question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough\nTo act to truly understand the universe as it is and I worry that we may not be smart enough to even who what question to ask\nAnd this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent we do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nSo so uh now dark matter dark energy the advantage to being modern human is that we can we can stand on the shoulders are those who came before us you don't have to invent calculus to solve the next problem somebody else did so in a way", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "02"}
