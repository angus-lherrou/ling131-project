very much for sharing your thoughts with us Paul I wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all\nThis ... it's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action\nWe know that we have to pay the global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War\nI Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual

shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in and the laws that her family is\nStruggling with to describe it and you know\nThis is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information is like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through um through relationship and trust and empathy um because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nUm [noise] I anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions\nThem that's the kind of discussion that we are so
