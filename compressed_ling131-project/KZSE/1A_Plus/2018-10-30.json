U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is report Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happened to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but letting\nOh in Kansas with regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth so a court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting look like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase or over the last midterm elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges if I had the ... turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so if we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we add six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state\nMichael do you want to what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd more expected this morning a we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um uh it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so um the uh Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian ... what's Kansas look like with early voting is falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know uh they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nWorked in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handled voting early\nWell it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters who'd like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research candidate amendment or proposition at leisure while completing the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWell ah basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado is your is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and fill\nOut that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or\nOr some other kind of relaxing recreational kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to read what\nExactly um you know and so uh you know a lot of people um like the system in color\nUm you know that ... ... ... world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm a you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already I'm now you've got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is an object to remind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hands on election day glad to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to lie to vote early and\nFor all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say sure I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and lie at their office in other ways that you can\nOne is to be over sixty years old or another is may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot\n... what is being over sixty has to do with voting early ah possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's going to be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to to sit\nOutside let's say in a wheelchair for three four\nHours and wait to vote so that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWas being silly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael do you want to an investigative reporter was K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado and Brian ... who covers energy and environment for ... M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas\nRicky tweeted I early voted because I have an hour commute and a twelve hour a day on Tuesdays I liked being able to look up all of the issues and candidates I was more informed\nAnd took more time with my ballot voting from home\nAmen to that ... I have done the exact same thing especially living in California where our voter guide was about as big as I think one if not two of the hobbit novels like stacked on top of one of it was a ridiculously fit guide and it just took a little time to go through so I hear you on that\nAccident investigators are told a news conference that officials have only a small amount of the information so far and don't know if it's correct\nThey're employing imploring the public to be patient\nAnd of course we'll have more on this story and other news headlines coming up at four o'clock on all things considered thank you for spending your Tuesday Morning with Minnesota Public radio news\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from visiting angels professional ...\nMeals and light housework nationwide visiting angels America's Choice and senior home care learn more at one eight hundred three six five four one eight nine\nAnd from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes and rates are available online learned more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nBefore we get back to our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about political rhetoric\nIt's a simple question is President Trump responsible for the recent act of political violence in our country a simple question but not an easy one how much responsibility does he bear\nAll week confusing rally rhetoric with criminal behavior who else is responsible and how much blame did they bear will debate this tomorrow but we'd love to hear your thoughts ahead of that so leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a\nHow much responsibility if any this President Trump bear for the recent acts of political violence in our country\nEight five five to three six one a one a or you can use our app won a vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics will share some of your thoughts tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Zoe Clark of Michigan Radio Michael do you want to of K.

I mean you W public radio in Wichita, Kansas today we're introducing won a across America will be spending the next two years traveling to communities across the country that don't tend to play an outsized role\nIn national elections before them come come back to ... let me get to a few more of your comments Linda tweeted I voted\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ... H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learned more ed E. H. R. go dot com\nAnd Melissa tweeted I loved to vote in person I enjoy seeing all of the people getting out to the polls and making their voices heard\nThere's only I'd love to react to a message that one of our listeners since we're app when vox pop from Michigan and told us three reasons that he's voting this year and all of his reasons for voting after you do with voting\nTruck from Michigan where all three branches of government or a Republican controlled and have been for a number of years\nThe main driver of my voting this year or two constitutional amendments that tried to rectify the Republican attempt to suppress or control election participation\nProposal links to put redistricting in the hands of a nonpartisan commission\nThe other makes registering to vote easier makes apps and a team voting available to all and finally to permit straight ticket voting\nThose are pretty important to our democracy and that's why I ...\nTruck thanks for calling for leaving his voice mail rather than through the ... what would you say that Chuck's call is that the kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year\nWell let's say yes that I mean there he is speaking about proposal to which is a redistricting as he gets checked sad and then proposal three which is being called promote the vote and and that would allow\nNo excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um [noise]\nLee a prop too which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the state has been a a barn storm of a\nA ballot I Am most ballot initiatives like one would like to think right that it's some people some community folks who are like we want to change the law in Michigan let's gather together and let's go you know get enough signatures and put it on the ballot no no no that is not usually how it works in the state usually a\nOrganization some kind of a political organization pays for signature sometimes a dollar two dollars per signature to get questions on the ballot but um this voters not politicians as prop to\nChanging redistricting a young woman Katie Faye he twenty eight years old when she started this all grass roots organization got four hundred fifty thousand signatures\nAgain grass roots volunteers to get this question of redistricting on the ballot and this is just sort of fascinated both voters and political watchers in general\nWe've heard from a number of you who are reacting to some of these initiatives in Michigan pat emailed in Michigan seniors over sixty are allowed absentee ballots I Love not having to stand in line at the polls\nThis year a referendum called promote the vote is on the ballot which would allow anyone to use an absentee ballot too many people having trouble getting to the polls on election day\nAnd John emailed I live in Ann Arbor Michigan I voted with an absentee ballot for the first time this year I Do so because I'm volunteering as an election inspector this year\nI'm also working with the voters not politicians group and supportive prop too which you've passed will make Michigan one of only a handful of states with fear of voter district de\n... what's the the kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures and who is opposing them is it kind of a partisan split or do Michigan voters tend to kind of agree that the time has come for this how how does it\nProgramming is supported by near or a new kind of precision pain clinics that pinpoints paying at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing NRA clinics dot com\nConservative Republican candidates ah come out against a proposal to you've got the freedom fund which is um I I get money from other device organization just last week uh putting one point two million dollars against proposal to again this is about redistricting\nProposal three though which is the promote the vote which would allow an shrine I should say straight ticket voting automatic voter registration same day voter registration and no excuse absentee voting\nWe really haven't seen a a organization fall and wholeheartedly come out against this proposal because for many folks are not only are these popular ideas but a majority of states in the country twenty seven states in DC all allowed no excuse absentee voting\nMichael do you want to let me come to you as another proposition that seems to be energizing voters in Colorado and that might affect other races Jennifer's in Colorado and she left his voice mail explaining her view on prop one twelve listen\nProposition one twelve on our ballot this year\nWould increase the distance between new oil development and any building that\nIs designed for human occupancy it would increase it to twenty five hundred feet which is less than half a mile and it's not unreasonable to me but the ads we see here are hugely fear mongering they're paid for by companies and they say you're going to lose all your jobs all your schools are going to close\nFires going to rain down from the sky it's ridiculous\nJennifer thanks for calling in Michael can you give us a little more context on prop one twelve particularly vis couch or argument the ... and Jennifer so she's been seeing on MTV I was\nSure it will be a ... to put a finger pointing out\nSupport comes from Saturn system software engineering providing custom project work staffing and support services for over twenty five years with a team of developers based entirely in Minnesota offshore to the north shore with Saturn systems more at Saturn says dot com\nSchools places at work and that's a threat to their health because there are these are basically the industrial sites\nThat are dangerous and uh they admit pollutants um the oil so the other side of this is the oil and gas industry which is ... which is big and Colorado um they say a this measure would essentially run them out of business because\nUm it would be difficult to find sites that are twenty five hundred feet away for every potential new site\nUm but just how difficult that is well you know that's debatable the the state's oil and gas conservation commission\nUm did a study a is saying that as much as eighty five percent of new development would be halted\nA but there was an analysis from um another one of the Colorado School of mines that used a slightly different methodology\nAre taking into account possible drilling strategies and they came up with fifty eight percent so still in either case you know the industry says that's a lot of business for them that would be lost and with it\nUm there are jobs in a potential economic impacts um estimates are into the billions of dollars one real high estimate was four hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nUm but you know let's go back to the other side as supporters one twelve I'm saving the industry's benefit to the state has fluctuated and decline in recent years and it's it's now about five percent", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city":
