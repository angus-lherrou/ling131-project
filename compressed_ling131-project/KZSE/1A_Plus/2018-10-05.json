you can invest for your child's college education and minimize your taxes that em and saves dot org\nStart today with Minnesota new every morning tapping was opposed to get at the top stories from our reach for you play a little whether in sports as a podcast called the NPR News update\nYou can find it on NPR One or wherever you get your podcasts\nThe final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow senators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those and just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers Congress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate that I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there is for key votes this has got to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear a in there and entirety over the next few minutes from two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York\nSenator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination with everything that they had the other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years and was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nWas Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation\nIt is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes needed Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their sides but don't\nBe fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for the\nUh matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their appointment\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can do let's get a sense of the seats\nYours Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young [noise]\nAh there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away or they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assault and sexual trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot put a Supreme Court you cannot elevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such crime\nRight they've not been found and what what they're saying she had said one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days [noise] as well we'll talk about that a little bit more on mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary the well with poison from the outset when President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom the list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest as a trifling concern compared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority\nOn the Supreme Court the rock worse and when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public just guarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd warning norms of transparency and fairness and finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn high school in twenty Eighteen the Republican majority conducted the hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One\nLook fair by comparison in this hearing there were no corroborate and witnesses on either side no independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even\nHigher than outside counsel to put a witness doctor forward on trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour and urging a break away members of their caucus Republicans submitted ... reluctantly two oh one week investigation of the allegations\nAnd investigation which was then severely\n... circumscribed by the White House our Republican friends blaming us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth ... first they blame us for delay knowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control of when ... brought to the floor leader McConnell could've moved this nominee two weeks ago or one week ago\nDemocrats had nothing no say and don't when it comes to who\nComes to the floor but in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats for moving forward when it comes to complaining about delay\nTwo words you never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips Merrick\nGarland Republicans are also\nWe engaged in quote a smear campaign\nWith this nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not do sort of come forward her conscience did and our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford and her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they using doctor forward if a smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate conduct here\nLet them look back on this chapter has the shameful culmination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America people who will stop at nothing to entrench in advantage on our nation's courts\nLet the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many years and a bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\nFor whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett cabin\nBut college the extraordinary events of recent weeks have raised them even higher this time when we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified to judge shore highest court\nNot anymore not after all this the United States Senate will also be making a say\nWithin the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America everyone is innocent\nUntil proven guilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenience and signal that media bullying and mob and ... are valid tactics for shaping\nThe center the mob can attack and the Senate case\nAlthough signed up and say that serious it's awful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy an American flight\nDeclare that our society cannot ... must not will not set the bar so\nSo Matt I'm president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation so well for so long\nFor on full display\nSo let's get back in ... through the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was so now says the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon to declare that this nominee would pave the way to turn it\nCrowds of far left protestors\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against it\nMore recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii you argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nNow listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's where I'm a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nSupport for NPR's brought you by the law firm of Inskeep intellectual property grip with offices in Minnesota in Los Angeles Inskeep ... group aims to help companies leverage the power of patents to protect their innovation you can find out more Inskeep law dot com\nThat was incredibly enlightening innocent jokes\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings\nAt play until of course one number of judge Kavanaugh last night southern strike earlier this week\nWe'll stop and consider the snap shots the absurdity shorted the indignity\nDish is our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of this year I committed\nWere racing to announce they'd made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation mere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\n\nIt was I was the bottom of a clearer that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nA clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called resistance until the final vote was called\nFor a few weeks there are parts played out along the lines that sadly had become somewhat ordinary\nAround here\nThere were excuses for delay those fell flat there were gross distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside doctor first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements\nThat are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice\n... hospital but went on\nHospitals vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but\nHere's the problem the old players weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out by the facts\nSenators received and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination than for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest\nCourt three hundred plus appendage\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character nothing like the character\nSo it was clear mind president they owe taxes weren't working\nProgramming is supported by near a a new kind of precision pain clinic pinpoints pain at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing nearer clinics dot\nCom or quickly sharpen\nInto political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow mysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for the truth the committee collected tested all organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh FBI investigation\nBy and embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence not not\nWhat's produced a support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh no corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiry\nOr from anywhere else\nNothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they have been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal post yeah again\nBelieve the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly four\nAren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid\nBecause individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand\nAbout nearly forty year old allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses\nNever mind that they didn't actually witnessed anything they didn't want us any time\nIs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called them this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nVote absolutely and we do see a number of senators that they're ... very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing and knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely aren't even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things kind of do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he\nThe confirmation that would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree to would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cash that for the magic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the combination\nFor Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime really of campaigning for a change to federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as that goes through the rules are killers\n[noise] Mr Toomey Mr Udall Mr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow\nWe're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin\nA at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live out the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm stance about the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a knife edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nDe telegraphed really even when he made the compromise with ... and ... of the Delaware has gotten into Delaware went to ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything\nFat so Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin and you said going to read that FBI report the Senate\nHas only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves and they have been a and it really is that I had it in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is that the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nPresident Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the bench and a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking a at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process is generated\nOn the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling NASA is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he ah the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking at only ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is a correct description but I Want to mention gentlemen\nHas now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe Manchin isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia He's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat\nAnd he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you're going to see a lot of liberal blowback I mentioned in the final month\nHe's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally the not quite final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex component has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nA Steve could be with him so what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nIn for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nAnd you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the terms the midterms are barely a month away this is a big way in a big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think was looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been an do jazz him gap has a lot of the service has shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have it when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparent gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look mid term elections are all about turning out your voters as ... and that was a challenge for us going into the ... it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up and the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism and Republicans\nAs a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been\nIn the Trump era and I think to win to to succeed is just sort of the nail on the coffin in terms of locking down for ... years yet\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election I'd like to know\nSupport for

S. is still trying to figure out a way forward I'm having looked at what happened to us and the two thousand sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nAlthough it's funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we vote that we are so many different kinds of voting systems might you know way kind of how it helps a lot it helps insulated from according\nTo the fact that we've got all these different utility company yeah but you know don't but but the key element here is we've done a better job at discussing internally how we would do counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention what standards of what's on limits and often it\nLet's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prize is particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one for their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war since\nThe announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis ...

us to court the international court of justice\nTo argue that the u._s. actions violated the terms of the Nineteen fifty five treaty of ...\nWell the Trump Administration hit back this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the U.S is ending that treaty\nThis is a decision frankly that his thirty nine years overdue\nIn July around brought in Marilyn's case and the international court of justice alleging violations of the treaty of amity or on six to challenge the United states' decision to seize participation in the Iran nuclear deal into reimpose the sanctions were lifted as part of that deal\nIran has attempted interfere with the sovereign rights of the United states to take a waffle actions necessary to protect our national security and a rod is abusing the icy Jay for political and propaganda purposes\nThat was secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking on Wednesday Vivian salami some have said that ending this treaty is largely symbolic is that

Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so\nI'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nTo on the international court of justice says ruling that uh that essentially said that sanctions that they re imposing sanctions um we're not fair to Iran\nMy step back for just a second what is this treaty of amity [noise]\nThis vision of some low level staff are going through the basement and looking treating asthma nature really\nDamaged I could read the whole thing for what we've heard about you know the the big acronym to Jaycee peel away the Iran nuclear deal but what is this\nTreaty mammoth well in Nineteen fifty three the U.S help orchestrate that coup in

Seventy nine so for thirty nine years uh there has been no enmity between us and Iran um this again seems very symbolic\nI'm just a last little relic that somehow didn't get shredded after the the the revolution in Seventy nine\nIt was the last hurrah of Kermit Roosevelt grandson of Theodore Roosevelt CIA operative who almost singlehandedly staged this coup and then they got everybody we put in power to go sign the treaty port Kermit he's getting no respect in the state department these days\nIt was permanent Roosevelt I'm taking it I I liked that name for it for a man who had such a place in history Kermit Roosevelt and I know where the American David ... is there any real effect in terms of\nThe sanctions the consequences to the U. S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of am at sea is more sim Bali where might there be more tangible impact\nSo the tangible impact is November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies warning that this was coming and those sanctions if he does it as he has pronounced\nThan a year round the world but particularly European companies\nIf you do business with Iran you're not doing business with the United states and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's ready pulled out the big um oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they were doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying we're going to find a mess it\nTo buy oil from Iran without clearing it in dollars so that the u._s. can affect it with the sanctions and a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when he was at the un ah last week and he made an argument to us was Saturday evening\nThat he believed that this method was going to come together so we're heading toward a conflict between the U.S and its European allies over on\nDo we have a sense of ... I think I feel like the the big issue really is Iran's nuclear program and the argument from the other nations who are still signatories to this this deal the Iran nuclear deal\nIs that it's it's not perfect but it's good and that it has done something to impede Iran's ability to develop\nA nuclear weapon do we have a sense of where we stand in that regard setting the economic stuff aside for a moment just is put us any closer on that path or we still kind of in a holding pattern I mean what is what's that looks like well\nThe Europeans as you say they they consistently say that they they don't want to North Korea is I mean this is of course before we became buddy buddy and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Rochester", "day": "05"}
