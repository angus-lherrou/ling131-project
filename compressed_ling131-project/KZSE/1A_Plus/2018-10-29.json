free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it is giving legitimacy and leads to action\nOne of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had there so uh\nDot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter clone um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter uh for for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know the absolute power of of free speech but when it ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only the sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a a place where white nationalism a\nAnd an extreme or bigotry homophobia whatever a has a has been embraced and\nAnd uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say his name was ... maybe not radicalized necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nA truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nPosted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA A N unproductive vent for a lot of that hatred I'm an after after um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active participant on gab there was a lot\nFor the first time a note noticed that at that at this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying our words are not bullets in social media posts I have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this ... free speech is different from from action and I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets\nAnyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWhen it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily for speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences then then there's sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing right um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people\nDon't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRabbi Jacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like Gavin job is not the only place where this kind of speech proliferate San line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment a quick First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and ... that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome\nTo folks like you sure it will first of all it's not new is that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death in life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nSeeing how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to spew such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign out before the election in which\nHe highlighted George\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

R. go dot com deeper\nInto that a lot of thought a lot of our listeners have been chime in on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts at that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evils of anti Semitism\nAnd every other form of evil and unfortunately evil comes in many forms and we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning he wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nMust stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote gotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Susan as in Silver Spring Maryland right outside of DC Susan writes\nI look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers that his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira I'd well this is of course incredibly disturbing to have the president\nThe first time LeBron James will be in town wearing a non

sounds weird but I actually feel some hope\nAfter the massacre it was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump's telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced in route as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAG W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real meeting\nIt's news for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be a consistent strong resistance to the hateful divisive speech that is anti American journalists need to be less accommodating and quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism of the president's ignorant rants if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who is both religious the Jewish and also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a strong religious views\nAnd a close connection state of Israel I mean I teach at a a small just ... here in the city and or in this in the suburbs and a lot of us didn't do feel uncomfortable with House bill that um\nYou know they express a strong and here is that if Israel or its best religious views that aren't um you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you are how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're a Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we mean there are students who are you know are not similarly strongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um\nEmphasis on friendly they find professors especially a friendly if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left and that that's true I think you are seeing and I think our students feel certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do to kids who probably should need need to shut up you know an artificial it but the you know you can't argue with that we're\nJust kind of who you're gonna have to learn to live with that she kind of pick your battles and I think that's a hard\nThing yeah depicted battles I should I mean I ...
