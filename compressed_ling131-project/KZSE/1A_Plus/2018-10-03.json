I liked the idea of finding purpose if I can I'm\nIn my vocation but what what I hear you\nWrestling with a different points in these essays is is this what it is oh there will be\nNo I said oh [noise] are you [noise] is that not right\nDo you mean like is this winning yeah Mm yeah yeah that's also true so I can see their that maybe maybe a lot of people in the arts or maybe a lot of people

going to be hungry again so for me I think that the drive to do and achieve and striving region new\n... new audience for a new you know creative projects\nThat receives and then the appetite your generates to try something new\nI mean some of this is I think about artistic integrity like\nAm I Am I going to play to the objective measures and read whatever rewards come from that or or am I going to do the thing that really feeds the thing is in there and\nI I kind of see you the wrestling with some of that\nI see I I think that the bind that I'm In or maybe the buying that I put myself in yeah is that I Want\nAll those normal objective measures I just don't want to compromise on anything ever to here we are this is is\nRight and that's\nThe that's the battle right yeah and everybody feels that I think in whatever\nI just I just feel like it's not about me it's about the way that\nAudiences are praised why would it be about you because I just don't think I think that audiences are game to listen to a pop song\nEven if it has literary lyrics as long as they're not\nDistracting I mean I just [noise] I don't buy it I don't buy this idea that you have to walk\nThe well worn\nLine in an effort to reach commercial success I don't I don't actually believe it because I don't think audiences are so stupid that they can't understand some subject [noise] I don't [noise]\nI think the

as he understood them when he was when he was still mortal\nThis is really interesting because this is something that Toni Morrison has written about the the vulnerability of the idea that doesn't have the answer right we are in a ... and we've been here for a while I don't think it's just currently with the political situation but\nWe're in a place that really loves certainty and it's really hard to I think to push back and be\nReceptive to the idea that there will be no pat answer which I think is some of the ... some of what you're coming after in these essays and what you're doing your

that people are going to say the only reason you're on stages 'cause you're dancing around in a tight T shirt you know I felt like okay I put out some music and people no one seemed to respond to that music so I wasn't as worried but also I think that some of what I look back on the ... that I wrote my son\nThey're very sexist there ...

A. M. U. dot org we've been hearing from so many of you Elizabeth tweets why is the minimum wage a specific amount instead of a percentage tied to cost of living or some other figure measured\nAnd adjusted annually and we'll emails us from Cape Cod I have a small landscaping in gardening business with depending on the time of year six to ten employees all skilled gardeners I pay at least Eighteen dollars an hour and I support a higher minimum wage we're going to be talking about minimum wage and a living wage let's\nA little bit Paul the federal minimum wage is just seven twenty five less than half of what Amazon is paying and what you can make in California starting in twenty twenty two hasn't been raised by Congress since two thousand and nine and its last ten percent of its purchasing power or even since two thousand nine how many states hew to the seven twenty five\nMinimum ... there are about Twenty one states where the uh minimum wage is just seven twenty five um and then there's another group of about eight states where it's the wages is a little higher but still owe a nine dollars are lower\nUm but but uh the other ... you know there's other Twenty one states have um a you know stopped waiting for Congress to act\nAnd have have raise the minimum wage including a whole cluster of them that are raising it significantly to the twelve to Fifteen dollar an hour range\nOne of the the the key things on the minimum wage to understand is you know it's a it's been because of of the role of money in politics and you know the congressional Republican leaderships refusal to um to to to allow any action on it um\nIt's really become irrelevant to the federal level it's so low it's not doing its job to rate of raising pay\nAnd this is a real issue right now you know and it's a ... receiving increasing attention um you know we're in a booming economy jobs are growing but there's almost no wage growth jobs are barely keeping up with rice the rising cost of living\nThe one place where we're seeing wage growth for workers at the bottom are in those states that are raising the minimum wage and that\nThat actually speaks to the point the important point that Mr solace within the caller raised about hey you know some companies are raising pay may do we need a minimum wage\nBut the the data shows that while there are some leaders to really raise the floor and ... improve improve improve pay and our economy we need we need fair standards and the minimum wage has to be a lot higher and\nThe um you know things have gotten so out of whack that today close to one in three Americans\n... you know forty million workers the median age is thirty is thirty five\nYou know these are overwhelmingly adults who spend their careers in these jobs and it's you know it's it's not it's fast food but not just fast food jobs you know the jobs are maker economy run about\nYou know one one for healthcare workers one in five educators you know huge laws of our economy of of our workforce you're stuck in these jobs paying less than Fifteen dollars an hour\nAnd ... I I think it says a lot when you see that the minimum wage is is laid down by Congress is almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents\n[laughter] just doesn't go anywhere in most states in most localities and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable in ... and notable state of affairs necessary Europe proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners who said why have a minimum wage why not indexing essentially to a real life now what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage\nRight well MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and type in where you live and it'll be a lotta number that's based on looking at the\nCost of local transportation food housing and other basic needs I looked up on the city I live in the district of Columbia they said uh the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for fulltime work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge ... additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers and the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their a contractor says the increase ... precarious nest of work that that's also\nPlane that we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages I'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we're it from a lot of listeners who say in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far let's hear from some of them\nWent all his head and I met a lot more to try to make a better for workers but whenever I catch up that's like a dog tired of heroin land runs the minimum wage and it's never enough\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour and a fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nI think there needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can assure you that Fifteen dollars an hour in South Carolina goes much further than Fifteen dollars an hour in California\nI work another job beside my full time job and uh so I Am kind of like ... by unfortunately I have lots of credit card debt and the result and uh actually like Eighteen dollars going out at twenty four a fulltime job would probably be closer to say Bye bye\nPaul we hear from a lot of listeners there who were living on minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress or be workers who work for big companies can't afford health care don't have insurance wind up relying on state or federal public assistance\nTo make up the difference and that suggests that all of us in some way are subsidizing low wages\nKnow you're you're exactly right and I mean you're ... or your callers I mean actually if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states I'm\nA single worker will need at least Fifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics and just a couple of years\n... your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars an hour we have a report on our website by my uh pinto PIN Tio on this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a basic national floor and we need to even go up from there like a you know you know in New York and New Jersey did this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour\nIn a hotel workers are are striking around the country in the higher costs that he's demanding twenty five dollars an hour or so you know your workers or your your listeners are right about about about what you know as a practical matter if you do the math what would it ... individuals need to to to get by especially in the higher cost regions\nAnd as a result you know a lot of ... of of companies big and small are relying on our taxpayer funded safety net for support you know more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year of safety net programs go to a workers and low paying jobs and you know these are good programs and we should have them but we need\nYou know major employers to do their part to pay a decent wage of at least Fifteen dollars an hour and then to supplement that with a\nWith work supports in order to help bring\nBring workers up to a a basic level now let's hear some of the other side of the Seth writes to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart we were all excited when they raised our wages to ten dollars and fifty cents\nBut then they cut ours to barely twenty hours a week then told us if we even had to have an open schedule we would get even less I'm skeptical of individual companies\nThat are raising wages and we received also a lot of calls from people who were concerned that raising the federal minimum wage to say Fifteen dollars an hour could wind up backfiring on workers\nI'm all for making you know Fifteen dollars an hour at that job on that now I work at it or get in the mall\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis

I Want to talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happened to be in a one eight studios at WAMC you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been\nA very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it but D.C as locals know it uh there was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others\nUm voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has the\nAnd they are in the process of voting this very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue\nOr what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for ... workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the wrestling in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement took three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um the the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nUm federally the minimum wage for tipped workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents technically if you don't make enough tips to bring that\nAh wage up to the the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr at a job where people face rampant sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system\nUm the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tips it did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this was a national ...\nFree and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this long article sector of the workforce Michael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this\nUh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters is is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so I I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it wait until three twenty in the morning um and the number of employees who showed up to say\nThis is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumbered those where they're supportive and I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage and in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in D.C\nAccording to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are already doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips made when among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money to come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees now you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages and minimum wages\nThey were fighting against increases in wages are are backed by business center as well so\nI actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward um because the the testimony they gave it you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up or at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to it or somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do and Phil Mendelson that chairman Phil Mendelson the chair of the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got us to talk about this which is that he said\nI have heard from countless employees to tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated he\nSaid that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's that's indicative of where the passion was on this issue\nLet's pull back from the district the district of Columbia to local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wage is wind up on public assistance\nAnd Randy in Tulsa emails advocates are correct Amazon Wal Mart McDonalds and the other giants can afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the mom and pop florist those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNow Sara I Want to talk to you about income inequality and wear a minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing wealth gap in mass\nAbout the shrinking of the middle class but at the low end of the pay scale can increases in minimum wage actually provide any real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent ... percent\nIt's meaningful but in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago two of my colleagues calculated that three men the three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bass those Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth that is greater than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the country\nAnd to date that's an understatement because Japanese as well as increased so much but nevertheless to dramatize is just how extreme the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen efforts to look not just at the low end of the wage scale but also the top and what can we do to prevent these really obscene levels of income and wealth concentration at the top that are so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this year for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between their CEO and their work or pay\nThe numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at at McDonalds it's three thousand to one and we can build on that information\nTo incentivize companies to to narrow there gaps and just one quick example Portland, Oregon introduced the world's first tax penalty on companies that pay their CEO\nMore than one hundred times their median worker pay this year they're going to put the revenue from that into homeless services and it'll hit companies like Wells Fargo and and Wal Mart that do business in the city of Portland\nI think ideas like that are going to start to spread like wildfire\nSpecific ... and an interesting set of proposals at a time when populism is strong\nIn our political culture both on the left and on the ride and workers voices and income inequality becoming a much more important part of the conversation you certainly see a lot of pushback from corporate America I think Bernie would be down Alexandria a Casio Cortez in New York would
