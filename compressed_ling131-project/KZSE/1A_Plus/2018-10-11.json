people for marijuana than all\nViolent crimes combined we know so much about ... freedom in we have a lot of work to do\nThat I wanted to talk about like how do we get to the other side of freedom what did it look like what does it feel like how do we get there with the strategy and the plane\nBecause I Know that when I think about what freedom is at its core it's not only the absence of oppression but the presence of justice enjoy that we can get rid of all the bad things and that doesn't mean that the good things automatically come into the air we have to fight for those\nSo that was where the other side of freedom came from it in the case for hope is that I think the hope is if you will for all of this hope is that belief that are tomorrow's can be better than that today's
