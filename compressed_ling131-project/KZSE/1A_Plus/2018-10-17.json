here's what I asked him about why tiny Pluto actually stands out in a big solar system how unusual\nThe numbers of moons that Pluto has and the characteristics of those moons I mean will you find other planets in the region that are similar\nThe way Pluto exists there\nThat's a great question let me uh uh do a little one on one you know among the the for small planets in the inner solar system mercury\nVenus earth and Mars is only one large moon it's our moon orbiting the earth Mars has two little rocks that orbited called for both in demos by rocks I mean things a few tens of a miles across Venus a merger have no moons\nNephew moved further outward to the giant planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune they each have dozens and dozens of moons some large enough that they would be called planets if they orbited the sun and others are just rocks again [noise]\nNow let's go to the third zone to the solar system the Quaker belt where Pluto and these other small planets orbit or Pluto was discovered in Nineteen thirty in Nineteen Seventy eight it was discovered to have a large moon half its own size and that was headlined than\nAh than in the Nineteen nineties as we started discover lots more small planets that was the headline and then in the early to thousands some of those worlds those small planets in the corporate belt were discovered to have moons of their own [noise]\nWe went looking for more moons of Pluto using the Hubble because if they if they were there we wanted to know to point our cameras and spectrometers at them on this one and only a mission to Pluto the one chance to take data and learn about this whole system\nAnd in less than two hours or a fraction of an afternoon Hubble discovered two new satellites of Pluto so the count went from one to three\nAh and then a few years later a fourth one was discovered and then a fifth one\nAnd that is a a a something more like a giant planet system than anything down here in the inner solar system since then\nOther planets in the court for belt have been discovered to have multiple moons but none as many as ...\nBecause ... is just better studied than all of them and I think over time we'll see still more moons discovered around small planets but it turns out that many have satellites and many even have multiple satellites so Pluto is kind of typical it's a record holder but not exceptionally so in the deep better solar system ...\n... is it exceptional in that it takes Pluto I think you tell us in the book six point four days ... days to rotate on its access is that right\nRight where what is what we call a slow rotator most worlds in the solar system turn on their acts as a in a period ranging from uh about\nTen hours to a ... about the the period of the earth or twenty four hours of Mars is very much like the earth of giant planets are typically don't rotate quicker than there are exceptions like Venus that takes almost two hundred and fifty days to turn on its axis\nBut ah put a will be an outlier at six point four days a and that's largely due to its big satellite called Sharon which actually slowed its rotation slowed the planets rotation overtime down to this almost week long period\nSo what does it mean for the the characteristics of the the atmosphere and the surface of Pluto is anything that it rotates that slowly I mean does that change anything about the way Pluto is\n[noise] it does ah it has some ah some effects for example on the uh the dynamics of the atmosphere there's a term in the dynamics and when you write down the equations called Korea was\nForce and that is proportional to the are all linked day and because the links days longer the corals forces smaller\nUh that would be one example but I think really and more importantly the fact that it rotated slowly had a large impact\nComing screaming up at almost a million miles per day\nAnd we're going to swoop down and study in great detail that the planet but because it's rotating slowly that meant that we would only get to see one side of it in great detail the other side would be largely unknown because you would see it\nHalf a rotation out three days before it from almost three million miles away\nSo when we first thought this mission out and we're proposing it and hoping to win it in the competition we included a big telescope on board the spacecraft was ultimately was named Laurie for the long range reconnaissance image or\nThey could uh be our long eyes if you will the could look even for millions of miles away and help us explore the far side of Pluto to overcome the quandary that the slow rotation imposed on a single spacecraft mission I\nThe way we do that as with your support so if you value what you're hearing the debt\nThe

maybe go back to this conversation will round out the discussion with Alan Stern\nAbout the mission to Pluto we talked about the pursuit of position precision he's a project manager of the New Horizons mission to Pluto and I asked him about all of the minute calculations and engineering that goes into hurling an object across the solar system\nWell let me put this in a in a different perspective realized that we had one spacecraft falling to Pluto to make a one shot flyby with no redo no repeat no second chance\nAnd I think had we thought any part of the analysis out incorrectly not just the navigational challenges that we just talked about but all the other software challenges to get the fly by right and to run this very complex piece of machinery called New Horizons\nUh it it it could very easily gone bad because there are thousands of ways to fail literally and there's only one way to succeed when everything works\nTough today just a bit about how you\nUm you account for that possibility of failure I'm interested in how the team thinks about that yes I Know it's making sure you get the right calculations into the computer but I'm I'm really more interested in the the emotional\nSpirit of how the team approaches the idea of failure\nWhen we take it as a challenge and uh it's all about the uh thinking through the problem in great detail it from every possible angle and hoping that you have a ... left no stone unturned and so ah we\nSupport comes from urban homework stable homes offer long term positive effects on families consider joining the stability

New Horizons inside the ethics first mission\nTo Pluto and in the course of our conversation we've worked our way up to the moment when the team realizes that the space craft is working as it should and we're in mission control so Alan put us in mission control on that day in that moment what was it like\nA ... I think you're referring to is uh just after the Pluto fly by about twelve hours later\nA after closest approach a space scripted been very busy because while it's that or you know close to Pluto we don't want to take time out to point away from Pluto and talk to the earth we accepted that delayed gratification that it should be collecting data all the time but about twelve hours\nUh we took a short break spacecraft that turned using its thrusters pointed the dish antenna back to the earth and sent a an engineering report for how the fly by had\nHad gone now that signal takes four and a half hours the speed of light to cross the solar system back to earth\nWhere NASA's football field size antennas that the deep space network receive that signal transmitted through our mission control in Maryland are engineers were looking at the uh uh the dilemma tree reports from the different spacecraft system propulsion guidance a command and data handling cetera\nAnd they all look good\nBoss of our mission control Alice Bowman I'm having gotten good reports from each of her engineers each of those men and women are reported on the public address system uh she she called my name she said mission principal investigator\nA spacecraft has had a successful flyby of the Pluto system and is now out bound with data\nAnd uh it was just pandemonium it was like one of those scenes in the movie Apollo Thirteen where people were you know fist bumping and hugging and jumping up and down and slapping each other on the back and knowing that everything we work so hard to achieve um had turned out well\nIn your life over the arc of your life where do you put that moment\n\nI wouldn't say it topped uh uh some of the events with uh uh the birth and er\nAnd er somebody cheap and it's our children have had but in terms of my career I Would say that that was a that was a as good as it gets a you know I work twenty six years from the day that we decided to go ask NASA to study and mission to Pluto\nUntil a that sentence was ... that had been successful and twenty five hundred men and women twenty five hundred Americans worked on this project one way or another overtime\nA bill to designing and building the spacecraft designing and building a launch vehicle designing and building and the nuclear power supply for it and then flying and across the solar system in for that big team\nA this was this was success for people who had worked in most cases Fifteen or more years on the project ... uh to see at work or and or there's nothing like that or that there's nothing like that this was the super bowl for us\nHow many of those twenty five hundred people that worked on the project you know with the primitive salute is does everybody\nWhat is that [laughter] that Pluto salute as a service and I you know I have to start back that's a little bit involved so let me let me try your patients are and and start in Nineteen thirty after at twenty five years search defined what was then called planet X. this young\nOff the farm a Depression era a young man named Clyde ... accomplished what astronomers had tried to achieve since Nineteen oh five in Nineteen thirty he discovered that planet X. which became Pluto by name later that year\nOr the ninth planet and ah ah\nWhat ... did was so monumental not only had he achieved with people other people couldn't over twenty five years people in a their research\nAstronomical community looked and looked and looked and looked across six decades until the Nineteen nineties before and more planets were found in the outer solar system [noise]\nUh it really talking about was two generations ahead of his time a ... not just as ingenuity because he reinvented the whole technique for how they made the discovery but his concentration he didn't mind numbing things that we would never entertained today we use the computer to analyze all that data\nDiscovering what matters\n[noise] looking for a daily dose of news that will lift your spirit checkout Bob Collins news cut blog daily conversation with your smartphone ... you can find it at NPR News dot org slash and use ...\nSenator Elizabeth Warren is DNA test is just one topic on the minds of Native American voters what else is driving them to the polls before away from them\nFrom W.
