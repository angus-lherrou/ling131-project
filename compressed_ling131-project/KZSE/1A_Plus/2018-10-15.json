think that the opposite I mean I'm not in the political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business that\nUh but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiasts on there is a twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lotta boy moms who are are really scared about the standard that Mona mentioned right the idea that a single accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized taken out to the\nThis is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nGene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time than the women who were raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel was talking about or justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boils ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nAh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nStarted when I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics wrote that one in four women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein into shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in ... the one in three women will deal with sexual violence it was a yet\nOr not race that's that's way overstated sexual violence of central so and that's a very very broad description\nClose against your will so right to be careful with a number yeah okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization all civilized society seek to cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because of the it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences of\nFinding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nOf feel like this is one of those moments early on as there were a lot of
