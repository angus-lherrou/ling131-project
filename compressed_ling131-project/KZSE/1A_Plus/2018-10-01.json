legislation but there is lots of action happening at the state level from immigration to gun control state houses and governors are passing bills and voters are approving ballot initiatives today we're launching a special series called the state we're in\nEach Monday This month we'll explore the bills in ballot initiatives dominating the debates in state capitals what are the state level trends tell us about the political direction of the country\nThis time around we'll explore trends in gun legislation and proposals around the nation\nToday also marks one year since the mass shooting in Las Vegas at an open air country music festival it left fifty eight people dead and hundreds of people wounded\nAfter that shooting many people called for more gun control measures particularly on bump stocks some states passed bump stock restrictions other major restrictions went nowhere\nBut this year some things shifted after another mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida a gunman walked into that school and killed Seventeen students and staff\nThat sparked a movement led by students survivors and states around the nation started restricting gun access including some states with Republican governors\nJoining us in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to ... thanks very much for having me\nJoining us from NPR in New York is Chris Brown the president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence Chris welcome thank you so much and joining us from Texas Public radio in San Antonio is Richard Feldman the president of the independent firearm owners association\nHe's a former lobbyist for the n._r._a. and he's the author of Rick is Shay confessions of a gun lobbyist Richard thanks\nYou we should note that we have made attempts every single week to invite the president of the n._r._a. on this program we are eager to hear\nFrom Mr Oliver North thus far or in treaties have gone unanswered but that invitation still stands Scott Greenberg let me start with you this has been a heck of a year for the gun control movement and also the gun rights movement in the U.S\nGive us the broad overview of what's been going on as I understand it there are about fifty new laws restricting gun access that move forward including and fourteen states that have Republican governors right\nThat's right and uh we tracked this since um the shooting in Parkland, Florida a last February because uh it what we found and this is really interesting was that up until Parkland even with uh the many other mass shootings unfortunately that have taken place\nA that for the most part states reacted by expanding gun rights I'm up until Parkland Parkland seems to have shifted something or perhaps a because the students there um\nOf Iowa and I'll be there very soon we'll be doing something very important that Iowa [noise] but this is maybe\nMore important than all of it put together a journey so I Want to thank you for being in a congressman holding congressman row congressman new house and congressman meadows thank you all for being here we are very much appreciate and you've been very instrumental\nThank you [noise] I'm\nTo speak to the American people to share truly historic news for our nation and indeed for the world I Wonder if like vice president Pence for joining us this morning\nSuccessfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA Andy NAFTA trade agreements\nWith an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement calls us embassy a sort of just work [noise] and\n[noise] us MCA [noise] that'll\nBe the name I guess that Ninety nine percent of the time we'll be hearing us MCA\nHas a good ring to it I have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made since NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars\nAnd it's a much higher number then that with Canada and Mexico at last vast amounts of money\nAnd lost four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four auto jobs lost about twenty five percent of our orders jobs even more than that\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise but for twenty five years as a civilian as a businessman I used to say how can anybody have signed a deal like NAFTA\nAnd I watched New England and so many other places where I was uh just the factories were leaving the jobs were leaving people were being fired and uh we can't have that\nSo we have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity\nTo me it's the most important word and drag because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations all over the world that we're changing that\nWe just signed a much better deal with South Korea we had a horrible horrible deal and we just signed up at United\nThey're happy we're happy it's good for jobs good for a lot of things when that deal with side they said two hundred and fifty thousand jobs\nWill be given be by signing this transaction then they were right I've said it before they were right two hundred and fifty thousand jobs to South Korea not to the United states so that's changed and very much for the better and this one is a brand new deal\nThe agreement will govern nearly one point ... trillion in trade which makes it the biggest trade deal and the United states history\nI Want to congratulate us trade representative Robert Lighthizer who has worked nobody understands\nHow hard is [noise] [noise] no matter when\nYou called him he was in the office or he was in somebody else's office during the same thing hey Bob ...\nI've heard it for years I said if I ever do this I Want to get ... to represent us 'cause he felt the way I did and the entire team at the U.S see are standing behind me and some right here in the audience I Want to thank\nYou [noise] had a feeder Navarro every [noise] fantastic\nGroup of people they love our country I also want to thank secretary my Mnuchin secretary Ross secretary Nielsen secretary do Jared Kushner Peter Navarro and the United states ambassador to gather Kelly craft thank you thank you Kelly\nAnd [noise]\nAlso want to thank president pain yeah the act of Mexico we had a few disagreements but I really liked him a lot I think you may like me I'm not sure\nAnd then he'll be leaving a soon but he's really done a good job and wonderful wonderful person and the Mexican president elect Lopez Obrador who has given his support to this agreement and\nWe're developing a really good relationship which I think is very important for our country frankly and from Mexico\nAnd uh so they work together on this this was done by both I said look I don't want to sign an agreement and then a new president comes and they don't like it and we have difficulty ah they work very much together on it and I appreciate it from both a\nHave to certainly give my highest regards to prime minister of Canada adjusted to do\nA lot of stories came out about the adjusted and I are having difficulty together do we did over the trade deal but I'll tell you it's turned out to be a very very good deal for above and a very very good deal for all three it puts us in a position that we've never been in before\nIt's very good when you look at the world and what the world is doing and what when you look at the unfair trade practices that countries are using against the United states or this is a terrific deal for all of us\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement in the history of our country\nWith the most advanced protections for workers ever\nDeveloped if you look at the reviews people that would normally not under any circumstances say good things because automatically they have to say bad even some Democrats say that's amazing we had some they they haven't been given the soundbites yet I guess my\nBut actually had some Democrats say this is really amazing if he really got all of that\nBut by a tomorrow I Would suspect they'll change that\nKnow how good it is it's an amazing deals for a lot of people\nLike why is it will be the most advanced trade deal in the world with ambitious provisions on the digital economy patents very important financial services in other areas where the United states\nHas a strong competitive advantage Mexico and Canada have agreed to strong new labor protections\nEnvironmental protections and new protections for intellectual\nProperty so important\nThis new deal is an especially great victory for our farmers are farmers have gone through a lot over the last Fifteen Years they've been taken advantage of by everybody prices have gone way down and we're working on some other deals that are gonna make I'm very happy also but this is a very very\nBig deal for our farmers are Mexico and Canada will be opened up\nA lot more than they are now and I think there'll be a better spirit between the three countries which is important for farmers the agreement will give our farmers and ranchers far greater access to cell American Grown produce in Mexico\nAnd Canada the deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers opportunities to export American wheat poultry eggs and dairy including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream\nTo name a few I Want to be very specific\n[noise] I Want to be very scripted [noise] right [noise]\nMany other products but those products or we're\nReally being treated fairly as far as those that work so hard to produce them and now they're going to be treated fairly these measures will support many hundreds of thousands of American Jobs\nWhen for American manufacturers\nAnd American auto workers who have been treated so badly we've lost so many jobs over the years under NAFTA\nUnder the current new deal and if you look at the current NAFTA deal the new deal is taking care of all of these problems 'cause NAFTA foreign companies have been allowed to manufacture\nMany of their parts overseas\nShipped them to Mexico and Canada for assembly and send their foreign made cars into the United states with no tax\nSo we let people go we fire everybody they make cars they make products they make everything in another country they send them into the United states no tax\nAnd the cost is very little difference sometimes it's more for those people that liked to talk about cost\nWith this agreement we're closing all of these terrible loopholes that flows they gone there were a disaster for example we're requiring a large portion of every car to be made by high wage workers which will greatly reduce foreign outsourcing which was a tremendous problem\nAnd means more auto parts and automobiles will be manufactures inside the United states we will be manufacturing many more cars and our companies won't be leaving\nThe United states firing their workers and building their cars elsewhere there's no longer that incentive before under the NAFTA deal they had that incentive they have the opposite incentive now we're not going to be losing our companies that was to me the most important thing\nThe United states in a trade deal has lost\nOn average almost eight hundred billion dollars a year that's dealing with China dealing with European Union dirt period when everybody\nJapan\nMexico Canada everybody\nBut we have to have a strong manufacturing base\nAnd manufacturing\nWe need a thriving economy those are all in really essential ingredients to national security we can't allow what's been happening over the last twenty five years to happen\nWe're building our military like never before it'll be the strongest it ever was that all of those jets that are made and rockets and missiles and ships there will be made in the United states jobs [noise]\nOur economy is booming like never before jobless claims already fifty year low\nThe stock market is that a all time high\nI think of that over fifty percent since\nMy election fifty percent people the four oh one k.'s and they have four oh one k.'s and\nThey were dying with them for years now there are so happy\nI was telling the story I often tell of a policeman in New York came up his wife was always very upset with him as an investor because he wasn't doing well with the four oh one K. is now she thinks she's a genius because the numbers are so crazy but we're up over fifty percent since\nThe election and\nYou've heard me say this many time but African American unemployment Asian unemployment Hispanic unemployment\nIs at\nLows in history not you know for the last two years the history of our country African American Asian Hispanic young people without high school diplomas all at historic it's a very important sector\nAll at historic lows lowest in history it's really ...\nMuch with people that get out of prison we have a tremendous problem people come out of prison they can't get a job\nEmployers don't want to hire him the economy is so good they're hiring them and they're turning out to be incredible\nWorkers they're given a chance to really give it a second given a third chance in some cases but I've had numerous employers come up say I'll tell you what I've taken people that were in prison and\nWe've hired them he wouldn't have done this in a normal economy or a bad economy only in this kind of an economy and now he's like the biggest fan and one man in particular stake in numerous people said most of them had been unbelievable you could ask is most\nBut most of them had been unbelievable that's a great thing it's a really great thing it gives them a chance so before we take questions I Want to extend our warmest condolences to\nThe country of Indonesia\nFriend of mine were going to be calling up the leader who is a great leader indeed but they got hit by a giant sooner army or like\nPeople have not seen this part of the world has seen it so much fortunately they say that's the worst of all you look at the tornadoes hurricanes you look at all of the different natural disasters friend of mine who studies natural disasters I don't know why he does that\nWhat he does he says the suit that that should not me is the worst of all and uh they got hit very hard and probably thousands of people killed we have already sent a lot of first responders and military and others to help\nA but it's a really bad bad situation\nFinally before closing I Want to send our thoughts and prayers to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting\nAll time and the life of our country\nTook place exactly one year ago today all of America is grieving for the lives lost and for the families they left behind so to all of those families and to the people of Las Vegas we love you we are with you were working with you very hard\nI was a terrible terrible event\nSo thank you very much for that\nI wanted to ask a Bob Lighthizer who uh is just a terrific individual as well as a man that knows a lot about this subject to come up and say a word about the u._s. MCA\nThe new agreement and or if you have any questions will take some questions after that plays spot\n[noise]\nThank you Mr drove through the system before I started I Would just like to get rid of it yet because I think it says something about working for the president so August sixty of last year we started this process and I'm at a hotel in Washington and there's like\nYou know hundreds and hundreds of people waiting to have the introduction of myself and my two counterparts one from Canada wants to the United states\nAnd I'm getting were lined up and I and I get a caller says the president wants to talk to you so I go to the little anti room like the the cell phones browsers and starts talking in everybody's kind of waiting and he's talking and he's going through what he wants to get done in the afternoon there's problems with it all of which is quite familiar with\nAnd then he finally says two things which I thought were telling one he said Bob I Will back you up like no other us to yours but backed up in history [noise]\nAnd then the second that he did that by the way and then the second thing he said was he's sitting out go out there and have fun and I thought\n... you're listening to live coverage of President Trump's remarks at the rose garden at the White House right now ... Lighthizer try a U.S trade representative for the Trump Administration to\nDollars easily making it the biggest agreement in history [noise] uh we have done this in fourteen months and believe me in trade negotiating terms that slight warp speed\nWhen we began these negotiations last year the president instructions to me were precise in straightforward protect American workers\nFight for our farmers and ranchers preserve America's competitive innovation ads secure greater access for our businesses and above all\nBring back jobs to America I think we have succeeded with this agreement the U.S MCA\nWill accelerate the manufacturing renaissance our country has enjoyed under President Trump it will bring our trading relationship with Mexico and Canada into the twenty first century and it will protect America's competitive agent digital and and innovation or across the economy\nThe new agreement will also served as a template for our trade agreements under that dropped and it goes on a jobs ... in the future this paradigm shifting model rests on three pillars\nThe first bill or is fairness we have negotiated stronger rules of origin for automobiles which will bring billions of dollars of manufacturing back to America we have secured greater market access for our farmers and ranchers\nWe've agreed to unprecedented labor standards that will help level the playing field for our workers\nWe've also agreed to a first events\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...
