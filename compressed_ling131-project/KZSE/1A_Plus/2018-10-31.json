better to be a better actor I started when I was Seventeen and I started in the sixties and situation comedy TV\nAnd in those days um situation comedy TV wasn't you couldn't transfer from one to the other um today is a different world\nUm men came out of television in those days um like James Garner and Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood but they were an hour long shows and they were Oh yes men so [laughter]\nAnd women were usually in the situation comedy shows that were very popular and no one could make that transition really it was incredibly difficult we were like the day laborers as

body on the line for them sometimes literally um anyway [noise]\nBut in in playing these roles because I had learned to craft\nAnd I could go into myself and sort myself out and say I want this part of me to do this and I want this part of me to come here it meant I could I learned to call on them to have\nConversations with each other and in roles that I needed them they informed me because they

and um [noise]\nI was with him and he was my father essentially even though I had a a a real father that I Would see frequently but my real father was nonexistent he he would demand that I come over and spend time with them but the minute I was there\nI think he didn't know what when I was very little he didn't know what to do with me I I think he thought it was another species along with my brother we were like little kittens and that you give them a little food and the litter box and make sure they have water and maybe a little a little ball rolled around\nAnd then you're kind of go do your thing and I he never I never had a conversation with me never took me to have a cheeseburger or go to the movies or go to the park or play\nBall [noise] nothing and I would if I wanted to sit on the couch with him and listen to the ball game that would be fine I Would have rather eat in dirt so [laughter] so there was that side than my stepfather\nWas big and loud and colorful and very

A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few more of your comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as the vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans\nHate is now fair game at high volume what they call the end the political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Eric I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laura is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can tap into something that wasn't ...\nI think that's a completely fair position I mean you know in the United states has had a long problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nSo that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example on line hate rhetoric particular lean during the years that Obama was in office as an African American he very much a\nSet off white supremacist you were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet it self has allowed this kind of material to proliferate radicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior air as so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\n... how do you see it uh there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe ah there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of a post World war two consensus um you know in general threw out to the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political uh aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse in this is not um I'm not even talking about the rhetoric of hate per se um of polarization and the opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people\nIn America identify as Republican about twenty seven or twenty percent identified as Democrats these are historic lows\nAs those noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions we\nNeed to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nYou know that is not based on demonization polarization and again you know Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level I he should be leading the discussion in a way that has more productive than he is\nBut he's also not the only one are you doing this um [noise]\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is\nWhat is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a vial of a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera\nBut in general crimes are going down and violence has gone down so again recognizing that rhetoric is one thing and reality is another I think is you know it was the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick how much\nPower we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but I think ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence mhm those words yeah weapons for sure and they let you all wore\nA you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where and saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about that so I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous or it has hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then it knocked policies that actually work for the benefit of of people I Do\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoor through October an indoor markets open throughout the winter you can visit farmers' markets of M.

I Wonder how you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces violence at least at a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see this\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility and if we have a moment that after answer\nAnd so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he is forced to do that\nUm but that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial on in these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that he has some responsibility for something\nSo for example during the campaign I'm a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge and what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julian ... kill 'em and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nAnd and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was said\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...
