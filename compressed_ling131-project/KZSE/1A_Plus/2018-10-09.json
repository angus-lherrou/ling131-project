mirror clinics dot com\nCrash law I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were actually involved and the money the narcotics trade with and the Chicago area and\nThere for I began\nAnd operation dubbed operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI use the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers one of them being a boss to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence was unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist\nA they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nOwned or one vote is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer how law enforcement in my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider but I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught\nYou go because their drugs all of us know why do you think it's not a similar mentality and law enforcement\nYou know honestly a lot of police officers dead approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on as police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence\nIs so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nOfficers actually\nFear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there is this common misconception that it's blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually\nInstructing the officers who were working with me not to back me up\nOr they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of\nFear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it ... it's easier it's easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't\nWant to they thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen ... because I'll be next\nLet me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of

of the politicians I think that\nOver the last several years the views this case one face and I want to remind everybody we answer millions of dollars every every every year and they've used this case to really took round the Chicago police department which has been unfortunate because I'm going to tell you this and um\nThe men and women of the Chicago police department are sort of the finest

O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Neal Franklin shed and Spalding Patrick Smith and judge will Doris Cordell let's get to some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward at where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard\nWe do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however Galvin had these questions Calvin writes the question is\nThis diesel being a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force is a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals or the actions from the police glued to the criminals actions to Cornell maybe you should respond to them how do we suss out you know minor sense what reasonable misuse\nIllness is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition\nAnd what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes of the officer and what was the officers dating experiencing and often times incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it\nBut but I Do want us to get to something you said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is ... militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income community\nThat's not how policing started in this country policing started with individuals who lived in the community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community\nAnd it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth\nWith tanks and all kinds of of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers\nTo basically a patrol and and take care of traffic issues\nThe humidity why can't individuals' community members somehow ... ties to deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMoon sometimes some of these ... and I'm I'm not disagreeing with you or just by way of conflicts there are some places we're a lower level of sworn law enforce off or worse when officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nShort but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic force\nAnd and they they do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different\nModel entirely I'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened we we get body cameras and what what happens well we have officers civil oh don't turn the cameras on or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order\nTicket footage out on that for example in liquid shooting so that that the whole lack of transparency policing for example has very little sunshine\nThere's very little sunshine and policing we don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history they're disciplined history it's very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that does to us with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland with this in our inbox\nI talked to who we both black and white and uh they seem to have this new thrifty approach the community on him and experiences where you know we that we you know would rather have conflict with ah with me\nKnow take away the first couple of months but at least to buy a it's added a community without gun makers Dana communities are forced to have a dialogue with me I think it'd be a lot better uh was certainly a community\nWhere did you thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gotten from some of our listeners like what's scholar Rhodes Scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line everyday protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality involve people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um\nYou know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue seat when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving\nAnd you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge courthouse had [noise] um\nHow it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors when something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force\nWere you know none of the people who are very few of the people the ones that you do know there's conflict\nThat's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community\nDecides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever with the community decides what's important where the community decides you know what we can handle these issues that the ground level we just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political it's political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place until the community to side and they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it\nHaving that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly wrong\nIs speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing in review boards were part of it including on a larger scale\nJamie asked shouldn't there be a national group or board who could provide oversight over individual police departments they could be an objective trusted advisory board who's judgments both sides would trust and accept", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "09"}
