not cover himself with glory in that moment where he was mocking her and diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand um there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also\nReally lemon trouble stopping people in restaurants and and driving a people are from the public square um uh you know accusing someone of a absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that ah the some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think that somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nWell and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that Mona El Yon also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate around Brett Kavanaugh that seemed to not get a whole lot of mentioned in the final analysis didn't get a lot of mentioned from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like fifty minutes ... on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fascinating I was hearing if you haven't heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something that awful that I Know I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened\nTo give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of so by the way ...\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in ... in his testimony had to answer not just for a lousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations and and he was upset\nAngry in tears enraged are outraged on\nDemocrats sort of their their arguments a became one not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about\nTemperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it\nAh their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but that he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered intern that are Democrats had said he was to ... and the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they thought that wasn't good enough\nI'm from a from a report ... perspective on that the temperament question was an interesting one to me it's sort of seemed to me from afar that looking at the justice says on the bench we know all of their politics are based on the president's who point them and based on the way they ruled\nSo ah the temperament question was\nInteresting I'm not sure how relevant it is because we know all the politics of all the justices\nNot really sure how cabinets temperament plays into us with\nRegards to temperament and civility Sam wrote on our Facebook page there's a difference between the

tomorrow on one day back now to our conversation with you know step in early on a Johnson and motive Sharon ... let me let you jump in and responsibility on his comic before we could go\nA little early on I mentioned that that Republicans might suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in the political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business if you're\nA but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's a twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nFor a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness it was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of boy moms who are are really scared about the standard that Mona mentioned right the idea that a single accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized ...\nThere's no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nGene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time\nThan the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel was talking about or justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boils ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nAh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization and I'm the only one I\nFor something from the comment the comics wrote that one and for women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein into shearing said that according to federal statistics is one in ... the one in three women will deal with sexual violence was a yet or not\nRace that that's way overstated sexual violence of central so and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against their will so right over here for the number yeah okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male\nSexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization\nAll civilized society seek to cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because the it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences of finding a guilt finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice in fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nI feel like this is one of those moments early on and there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show was a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over\nShut you down until you do I hear your Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics so we are not I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better\nWell I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabin are confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in a court of law and the question raised in it was should he a\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should uh have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and that seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that there certainly is energy on the left but it is met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that\nUh men should base a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled was sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court by should know that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was very high political theater in some ways when you get down to it and that was kind of the reflection of one listener who just left a note in our inbox\nName is far I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I'm very disappointed and our congressman and I'm very disappointed with the United states at this\nI really do feel that it was all up the joke that a wet behind doors and said okay let's get the country a good show they already know what they were going to do it's not a government by the people on Oh yes it is only up to take killer group\nForce appreciates calling and sharing your thoughts with us when we get to a few more comments as we continue Tina in Grand Rapids Michigan emailed\nI'm so sick and tired of people talking about Kavanaugh's reputation in life being ruined that is absolutely ridiculous usually wealthy privileged white man whose life is nowhere near ruined obviously now he's been confirmed and will be on the Supreme Court\nHer life is the one that has been ruined if anyone's life has been ruined the me too movement has not been weaponized for political gain and upset that your guest just said that on the air so angry right now this is real for women\nIrwin in Arkansas emailed so we're having a really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right where some say he will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate in us that meant this gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about in her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote for\nBrett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with precedent on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will drag the court kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nOn because he's replacing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift the right on the court um I think it will be much more measured than some art cleaning and I think it's really unlikely that you see roe versus Wade something like overturned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrow in at the precedent on abortion allowing states\nAnd then the second and third trimester is I think that's more likely outcome on those issues um I Do think that Susan Collins overstated a cabinet as moderate credentials a little bit and her her speech um because he was as a judge on the appellate court he was following Supreme
