General Mills is a very value a German company and they're they are they are present\nThey just have to say but but but also but but\nTrue and the and that's why this community mindset it is so important but uh we have examples\nWhere under gender of agriculture they're you know we work with a farm in Georgia and they've been doing this for Twenty years\nAnd I can tell you that the amount of the amount of nutrients that are is a question there so you can watch it go up and it has been as it is\nLet us to invest in Gunsmoke farms in South Dakota which is not all going to be the largest organic farm in the United states is thirty four thousand square acres it's fifty square miles\nAnd and and we were not doing that on her own we're working with others to do as a temp Turner from conventional farming and to regenerate organic farming and I'm In the process creating pollinator habitats and working with desert she's decided to do that and the nature conservancy and so\nUm we're we're putting our money where our mouth is which we have several million dollars wrapped up in that seven million dollars wrapped up into restarting pollinator habitat so\nWhich is which sounds like a lot but it's it's small compared to what General Mills generate senior\nYeah it is I I Would say you have to start you have to start somewhere and the the key is part of it as the money amount but the rest is making sure we have partnerships I mean you notice that when I talked about pollen as they also talked about this or to society and we also work for the University of Minnesota when we work with several health we work with\nWe worked with the nature conservancy to to put together a study and we're working with a farmers in South Dakota\nThe the challenge with her gender of agriculture is not the theory of it is to practice and that's going to take a while to get us from where we are to where we need to be with someone needs to light the spark just like we did with the meal connect program and grocery stores and restaurants and I I feel I feel great the general mills has let the spark now we now we have got to make it\nWork overtime how clued in argue about what General Mills political action committee is dealing when it comes to these issues of climate and sustainable agriculture I mean is that something that you keep track of\nWell the political action committee and what I Do by by uh by definition has to be different ... so I mean and I know I Know some of what the political action committee is doing but it's\nThat they can understand but you also know that they contribute to campaigns have candidates who know denied climate change or aren't willing to work on some of this\nMinerals so yeah so I had I had a I had honey nut checks and I was up kinda early this morning to get over St Paul from Minneapolis so I did have a couple of cups of coffee as well\nAre you a creature of habit when it comes to ...

I mean I've gotten somewhat obsessed with local public radio across the country going out with this book yellow like the best people in that [laughter] um\n[noise] you know my father by the time I was born [noise] um I understood him to be a drug addict you know I knew at some point\nIn his youth he had been considered the one of the greatest college football players in the history of the country I'm In history of Texas Rob and went on to Ohio State and play for woody Hayes [noise] uh in the seventies or was MVP of the Orange Bowl and you know went on to be a legend\nWell this addiction story was interesting because I was just told well this kid through his life away for drugs\n[noise] um but as I was researching this book again into my own father was I was researching the book I found that the first time he use drugs was actually for the Orange Bowl game\nHere broken his back earlier in the season and the game against Purdue\nAnd five games later a woody Hayes want him to come back and he wanted to come back and so man offered them cocaine\nUse Twenty years old he took it he hit the game of his life he was Orange Bowl MVP and but he never played another game without using ... and things power from there\n[noise] so what I had to try to do\nIs trouble this villain hero narrative that I was given and we've been given so many of these kind of flat narrative this person is bad this person is good such and such\nAnd to see that it was more complicated and then that to see that there were actually structures and systems are in larger context that were driving the decisions and outcomes of people\nMade bad decisions but those decisions were made in a broader context and without any kind of safety net you see I I\nI was going to say that your experiences and investigation into your family and your father remind me a lot of Gregory part lows memoir air traffic I Wonder if you've had a chance to read it yet\nI haven't no um heard great things he writes about what it's like to grow up with a father who is larger than life and flawed as we all are but you know that's slow realization\nAs a as a young adult uh of what those flaws meant his dad was an air traffic controller very good at his profession he was fired in the strike\nDuring the Reagan years and it just unraveled his own sense of identity and then the family and I he was I did an interview with them and I wanted to play an excerpt for you so you get to hear whether there's where there isn't any kind of resonance for you here is\nWhen I was very young this was something I admired and my father is with us was one of the things that that made him reliable one of the things that I at least I could rely on in him was that he was always write with intent as long as he gets as wrong as wrong it'd be\nStudents' performance of himself as self awareness was always in the right and and as long as I align myself with him I Would be protected by that dog could determine ism\nBut you know as we're saying the the older I got you know the the more nuanced as I understood about knowledge and other people and and ah letting letting people into allowing yourself to learn from others and you know these things turned out to be much more rewarding to me you overtime [noise]\nDoes that have anything to say to you know\nNot as good a child as um\nAs as Gregory was unfortunately you know it's funny I've I've got the spirit of overthrow him may somebody asked me why are you in Washington I said well I plan to take over the country by the end [laughter]\nNo you know I I write about my father you know I'm that I'm a great man is an inconvenience as a father right in part because every boy wants to be a man until it happens you see so um you know I also write that my father was the greatest man that I had ever known and his father\nWas the greatest man that he had ever known and this was most likely the root of all evil inside each of us\nSo you know in some ways and this is you know the ... I Hope comes through in the book I had a fantastic time being an orphan because I Want it I I I had no interest in any body are trying to convince me they were right I thought I was right all the time from the time I was about three or four yeah\n[noise] I don't want to skip over that that line I pulled that out as well the one that you just read a great man is an inconvenience as a father what does it mean well\nIt means in some ways um that the the big challenge and the big question in this book is what is the journey look like a to have the kind of courage and the kind of support to become your full is true as most whole self\nAnd everything that gets in the way of that whether it's structural racism whether it's a homophobic society whether it's poverty or whether it's the father this really famous [laughter] you know I mean all of these things of course they are not\nA equivalent um but I wanted to try to understand how all of these things might be at play um how the spiritual questions and political questions in deeply personal questions and also admittedly very petty questions are all at play a for a young person and and probably oh people to uh in the ...\nTo be you're listening to a conversation if you've just tuned in with Casey Gerald about his new memoir there will be no miracles here read more about it on the threat if you're just getting in on this you can go back and listen on the podcast later on as we put it up this afternoon and\nI'm I'm I'm really pleased that you checked out that shell about mental health in sports because one of the things that came through for me is that we heard from coaches\nAnd you write about the role of coaches to American boys\nUm which I think is an interesting question and this time when we're assessing what\nReal authentic masculinity is ... you say that it is often missed the coaches are family to a lot of the boys that they coach and family doesn't come easy in America first what about this coaching\nSome illegal role that many of us aren't aware is being played\nMm [noise] yeah\nI write I'm In some ways this is a sports book\nAnd I write so much and hopefully specifically both about my father experiences but also my experience playing Yale and when I was Twenty years old I mean think about I mean think about the parallels to the story I just told about ... when I was Twenty years old I broke my thumb\n[noise] uh and the second to last game of our football season we were playing for a championship and uh the doctor said well you you you can't play next week we were going to play Harvard for the ivy league championship and they say you can't play next week because you need to be in surgery\nAnd uh I'm Twenty years old and my coach wants me to play and I want to play All right so here we are with the choice same choice my father faced a Thirty Years' ...\nWell my coach Tony Reno who had become despite being a a a you know\nArea you know Roman Catholic I I tell people that I never met a Catholic and I was growing up in Texas [laughter] you know what I mean so this is real scary territory you see what I'm saying um [noise] he had become like a father to me and he stood there and he said well case we really need you but we will but we want you to be safe and healthy first\nSo they were able to find a more humane way to help help me play which they might have been dangerous but it definitely wasn't cocaine\nAnd he picked me up from the hospital when I had my surgery and he took me to his house and in Massachusetts to so his wife could cook me food I mean there is this beautiful thing in the book and and the reality I'm of the sports being these homes for people\nAnd our teammates being um our brothers and sisters are in our coaches being in some way as our fathers\nBut also our friends and people who are there for us and so the sports material in this book is obviously about these sort of larger critique about the system of college football recruiting which is pernicious and all of this stuff but it also is about sort of basic human transcendence that beautiful moment in the game\nFriday we could see some sunshine decreasing clubs friday

S.\nUm so in some ways this this is sort of um you know an intellectual debate although other countries are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is\nUm if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be a produced by burning 'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAnd mounted gasoline in your car that would produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide when you burn it that would raise that tax would raise the price of your gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated to buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would\nDrive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars\nNot because not out of some sort of\nA moral sensibility but because actually a ... a price on carbon would make it cheaper to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nTo hosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money lobbying Congress for price on carbon give us a sense of what the plan involves and why it is getting support now\n[noise] so um the bigger shields carbon difference plan is based on four pillars of the first is a robust carbon tax started at forty dollars per ton which would actually be the highest carbon tax of any\nA leading emitting country all of the money would go directly back to the American people in the form of a carbon dividend which means that\nThe most vulnerable would win economically from this plan and a third pillar is that we would trade a high price on carbon innate growing price on carbon\nFor some of the carbon regulation simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effective way to solve climate change\nLaws wanna make sure I understand so the plan if the plan went into effect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it with my car or my motorcycle or whatever and then that the revenues from that tax would come back to me as a taxpayer in the form of a of a dividend\nIs that what you called yes so a family of four would get approximately two thousand dollars per year\nIn dividends and here's how the system would work the more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about the dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\nHow much of that money would be spent on environmental programs are planting forests or doing research on cleaner energy with all of it just come back to us as taxpayers\nA hundred percent would go back to the American people and that is what makes the plan a popular\nAnd politically viable because in cap on Capitol Hill you'll never get the two sides to agree on how to spend the revenue Republicans will say well let's spend on deficit reduction are lowering the corporate income tax Democrats will say well let's spend it on a renewable energy innovation or a low income support\nIt opens up Pandora's box by contrast when you returned all the money directly to the American people it closes that box and what polling", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Rochester", "day": "10"}
