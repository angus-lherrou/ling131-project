or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax [noise]\nUm you know the Democrats believe this is an issue that works for Mali Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who worked her way through college and that you know Christian new new son of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get it in New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy\nUh you know boom times for people the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know their wage growth for people to lower end of the scale\nIs not in great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well I'm ...\nYou know Sunni should win or do we have to your terms here no governor's been talks after one term\nUh since two thousand four and prior to that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those uh here polling indicates new news\nAbout by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and Molly has outrageous Christian in three to one in the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advance\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he healed free ... doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only he's got a four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand you know interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but\nThis was a race Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture awaits them they think that ... uh buy dinner background but it'd be a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking\nOf nationally known names Frank or don't is I Wonder what your senses of Senator Joe brand making this trip to help Mali Kelly is their speculation about her future maybe in twenty twenty there's a lot of speculation\nAbout her future and twenty twenty um I think how much is it kinda resonate as as the big question I mean obviously\nThere's so many names being kicked around ah right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed ran as one of the people that that people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move or that she makes\nOn is being picked apart um you know analyzed a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact it could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because the Treasury Department revealed this week that the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred sixty six billion this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars it's a six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade\nTo hit a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars now Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly the tax bill part of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it bites\nThe economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest would more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly an advantage Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out though\nAt this rate although the economy is booming there's there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point um it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill\nI'm that obviously won't move forward until after\nThe midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on a welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kind of thing\nUm and so going forward you know it's interesting to hear or to the Republican silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits but it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again is welfare reform\nYeah I'm Glad you mentioned that because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on

the former military officer and his daughter Saudi prince denies any involvement in murder of journalists who criticized him Trump goes along with both anyone else worried about the u._s. abandoning our moral authority\nSonia wrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grabbing the Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that ... was murdered based on recordings hurt by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous turkey has not\nBecause of what's in them Turkey's government is not above repression and this kind of the various behavior themselves what exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that ... tweeted and uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa using interested party even if Trump is not interested in bureau would you respond to that [noise]\nAbsolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party this man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it and you know other newspapers in the United states and rolled media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention on it I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appears this man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world\nPart of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children\nAnd is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen\nHow can we say that word uninvolved party um you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who was alleged to have done something like this\nArms sales and include potential sanctions right and many other things\nI Will say though I James I do\nKind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because and we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we've never tried to exert strong moral or ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is an entangled\nBut I can take so nice point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so\nI'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it\nWell this is the limit ... to me amplify that point Josh records is absolutely critical you know ... someone who's been actually very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in them paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all of US military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalists for their opinions\nThat's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's a critical one\nI mean the show is called ... for the first amendment with that is in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published what is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and Arabic and he writes about this\nOf the free press in much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate unquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we'd never a threatened to sanction them over a there as you over their funding of ... and other extremists in Syria we never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any any country\nOr any country in the region for their actions except for Iran\nWho has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf\n... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with is that he may never really know who killed him there may never be any real\nThe fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you can totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers who took out to show G and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S has actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or or just recognized coming out of that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot sweet to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence of the Turks now have\nThey've photographed these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve of which are part of the ... the crown prince of security detail or intelligence services I think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that maybe they're going to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to ... you know offer up a a senior scapegoat\nBut I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened here\nWhat we will keep an eye on the story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news this weekend may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... G rightly given of course\nBut there's also an update from Afghanistan where the war continues to rage Seventeen years after it began with no clear end in sight\nYesterday the Taliban killed at leading police chief in Kandahar\nThe commander of us and NATO troops in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller escaped unharmed today the Afghan government announced it's delaying elections in that\nRight now fifty six degrees and the twin cities fifty six in Duluth in St Cloud it's fifty five in Rochester it's fifty [noise] this is NPR News at ten forty\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from ... am committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students everyday and nine hundred franchise locations ... dot com slash NPR\nFrom logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with features to help people stay focused to get work done and learn more it goes to meeting dot com\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station\nBack now to the friday news roundup with James kid field of the center for the study of the presidency and Congress in the ... of the Boston Globe and the Pulitzer center and have brown of buzzfeed do still a little more time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from around the world one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy and our neighbors to the north\nRight out guy now and I got a job and\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalized recreational marijuana nationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so worldwide was the first in twenty Thirteen Andrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd was like California legalizing weed\nSupport comes from urban homework stable homes offer long term positive effects on families consider joining the stability makers a group of donors who believe in the power of equitable and dignified homes for everyone urban home works dot org backslash donate\nI think that when you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal that at all if you compare that to\nThings like the un office of drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is on we legalization\nIf um you weren't you bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have been nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO ... Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which it it is doing now compared to you know being a private business\nUh that private but illegal business among many small dealers or it depends on how it affects the global drug trade and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift in you know\nI'm sure that Ken is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether causes surgeon traffic accidents where their claws asserted tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada yeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how\nPolice there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting that in this country marijuana is considered the\nMost illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there with heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that\nAnd the high potential for abuse there was a conference call this week with Todd ... who was in the Fisher with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint where I had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our ground be found in the midst of all and to the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's taught or one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things packed them on to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point no but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mess right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nWonder also dreams what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move or a negative moved there remains the question as to what legalization of the national level mind me for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because cannabis takes time to cultivate to the point of being syllable and there are long lines around the block\nAnd things are running out supplies running out I Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for well you know the ...\nAn uncontrolled experiment so we're going to we're going to find out a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprised when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and there's dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening\nAll over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to be made when you tax marijuana\nA and they use has happened in any way and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I I see is part of the continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north for probably going to get a jump on this on this\nBut um you know I I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYeah this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like to fly to love against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like\nIts issue about liberty and of course it helped spur of the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like if they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense too yeah that is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada Cain has had medical marijuana since two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a limb by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week MJ Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault and harassment also in India this week there were protests and violence meant by that but any woman\nSupport comes from urban homework stable homes offer long term positive effects on families consider joining the stability makers a group of donors who believe in the power of equitable and dignified homes for everyone urban home works dot org backslash donate in\nIndia or is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while uh I Know that our reporters at least we're watching Indian waiting and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where\nUh we were so sure that it would finally have an impact in now or in recent weeks it has finally like grab the country and shaking it\nOr we've seen as all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and assaulted by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is\nTry to bring these men into account and um it's it's\nReally interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism seeing ... and\nUh the most of the women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they are the the women who are I guess lower down on in social status will finally start to be believed as well\nWith regards to the protests of the ... temple in Carol estate the BBC's James Gleason was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no I don't know what the media and it turns out to me\nThey want to do the story goes up underneath their religion that's the only thing\nThat some of what the BBC's dreams Clinton was told in carelessly outside the ... temple their Indira I Wonder what your sense is of this protest particularly what the gentleman said it made it sound as if there's this X.
