I hate them because they're so hateful I hate it out I mean [laughter]\nAnd we blame the people for than expressing these used as though not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith\nIn people's intention to be good and\nAssume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard to assume\nI tried very hard to assume that you liked me\nIn spite of some of the but in spite of some of the things I Know you've read then and there and it's written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I Want to believe the best in people and I seems to me that's the gift I have to give other is if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou actually called that a daily spiritual practice I guess that's just you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught in one of the related dynamics developed this which is that the culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said\nWe like them or who voted like Sam\nSo but in a been a very particular and since you've said something I mean you said a lot of good to hear that but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret you said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes yes\nAnd um and there were goat was in it and yes and I said to talk to my natural about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and it shouldn't be on ... ask Erick Erickson what us you know saying this has to do with repairing civil discourse\n... you know if it was totally made earlier that we sometimes and and when I did that it was I think two thousand nine and ... it was just I didn't know any body but it a\nCouple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it with someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since um but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see this about the right\nActually our route several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes to their way ... and\nThe common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing pointed this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record all this but it really is where my heart is right now\nYou ... to the people in our city walk to the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics when Washington is the be all end all of everything everything's obstruct because none of us are in Washington I'm\nYou know I look I think it's very ...\nTwo points it's it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that\nBefore the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\nProvincial as them that that especially given the historical way and which are neighborhoods have been shaped led to a a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is that I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way\nFrom the skull first\nLike look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that said that professes\nUm that people can change and grow and in fact that is a core of progressive\nPolitics is that please don't stay where we've been\nAs a country in the divisiveness of racial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that\nThat didn't make sense it invites change in the country and in individuals\nAnd so if you if if your vision involved\nProgramming is supported by Mira a new kind of precision pain clinic the pinpoints paying at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing nearer clinics dot com\nUm but you don't shoot motives\nTo the person you you haven't walked in their shoes you don't know their background\nAnd we could all do a better job particularly at the local level in a PTA or or what not ... it may not be that they just want to a ... way to get their kid headed over your kid they may have real real reasons for wanted using just getting out of a beauty motives would go a long way to helping things\n[noise] um\nI'll give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip as we we know from neuro science that when people a sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they picked aside\nAnd no one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise]\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives and our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological or it's also racial economic um and you know it's a very ...\nHave these stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprised I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we're such quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexican food so\nBut are there are studies that\nYou know look kids to go to racially integrated elementary schools how grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh activities\nAnd after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us we I'm\nAs we wind down which is if the goal of a robust civility\nIs not that we agree right and that in fact uh we really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition\nIs that we we don't we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better when we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both\nNot perfect at this you know Sally said I haven't learned to stop hating it and and\nAnd and Eric ... yeah you said some of them were paid your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been in\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us and we're all centers um what is the experience you have of what does shift which is what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um have\nThe experience myself of being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel on line or off\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself in for Neal better [noise] I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it [laughter]\nBut it in them as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like it [laughter] uh\nI\nHad the\nPrivilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things\nAnd who the targets of that hate\nShowed kindness and generosity\nAren't those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they hadn't been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness\nAnd I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden that in a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at\nThe receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I get that there are times where it feels deadly unjust and him and in some cases it's too much to ask like there's going to laugh at us and the other hand this is where\nThose of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up yeah and also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people\nLike they are all extraordinary and beautiful in equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work and I I Am blown away by the difference it makes\nIt which I'm always struck um ... if it just ... to some degree or what is the first bad in scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel\nAnd it's not the fall short but in the apple is actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears world God says it's not good for men to be alone that's the first bad loneliness and show many of us concoct\nRelationships and communities on line\nAnd we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribes a Republican conservative liberal progressive Democrats will that tribes then becomes\nMix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more to to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know we were with a wife\nWho has cancer\nAnd I know we're we're running out of good years\nUm and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line or and not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I I don't think there's a coincidence that all related ... that we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids\nUm that level of local and I don't mean to keep our local here there's not a digital just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer\nThat everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home\nAnd bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know\nUm there's a there's a great Christian author was area Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and there is no better community in America than the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door and a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that our blessings our blessings to be shared with other [noise]\n\nJesus [noise] um\nWe under value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be sold around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise] I'm going to
