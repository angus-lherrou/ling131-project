like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has you know has is faring noble lineage um you know it's what is um that is the tradition that has focused on this for thousands of years\nBut you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is a very root of judgment character and will\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was British But that is the intention right of yeah that is in and that's just quite amazing and then in the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYay and William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to this you're rich you David than Daniel Goldman cliffs Erin mark Epstein\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and they lose something\nIn your work there's this thread you've pulled through\nIn seeing that this

brass\nIn and out and in and out and in and out and then\nRead the email and you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be\nAgitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be\nNegative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever ... we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it\nThere was a week in between that classes and so a week later they came back and we said how did it go and\nThat was radical knows me using and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that\nI picked up the phone [laughter]\nRight [laughter]\nYou know I mean there we all are emailing to the people on the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really house yeah I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah but what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and\nRecognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity\nFor the situation because you're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation you're much more or less\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it I communicated we did a lot of work with lawyers and judges and\nYeah that is there anything about that I wanted to ask you about that are so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it's yeah\nYou know it's they will lawyers worry that\nCan they be a zealous advocate for their client at the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that they judges are\nUnbelievably overworked\nThey have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this is probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff but they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them when it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and they loved it oh yeah\nI just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it is about two to three seconds long\n[laughter] kind of interesting\nLike physically like what we experience as a present wise to yeah and also that you can\nSupport for Minnesota Public
