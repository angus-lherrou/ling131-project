she's not up for election 'til twenty twenty so there's a lot of time between now and then that people are disappointed I'm\nMean we'll see sort of what happens in the next several months and years

Texas the small poor border town depends on its relationship with Mexico just steps away across the Rio Grande\nThe town would also be directly impacted by the president's proposed border wall\nYou know there's a lot of killing\nSure there are some places that have that that um I mean living here it's quieted that you know in the city\nThey love and all is here to tell us all about this he's the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its new six part series Dave welcome to the takeaway good to be with your tempting so what is ... Texas like ...\nOf your Texas is sort of this idiosyncratic little city in Texas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times\nIn a reporter Saddam Hussein who spent some time this summer down there found a place that really cut against the stereotype of what a border town is in the United states and what I mean by that is that\n... is incredibly dependent on a cross border sister town in Mexico oh you're not going back to Mexico and as a result quite literally people just\nLife groceries water a transportation family there is such a cultural connection almost a symbiosis there that were a border wall to be built um most of the people there feel as if the community would be not only cut off but even killed by its own country and they feel that\nThe debate in Washington is a world away from the reality that they're living down there I ... which is very bleak and uh in high poverty a not a whole lot of crime but certainly a lot of needs that they feel go well beyond a border wall they don't want the wall at all\nWell let's talk a little bit about that I mean you said it's a high poverty area I'm going to quite an in contrast with what the administration announced this summer that the war on poverty is largely over what is the main concern for folks and ... if it's not immigration if it's not the well is it poverty or is it something else [noise]\nPoverty but it's also jobs which I suppose the two are inextricably linked it's health on a very odd twist it in the story is that if you have a a an injury if you're very sick and you need to get medical care\nThere's only the most rudimentary basic medical care available and not in ... and you have to rely on the hospitals and knock out to to get a critical medical care otherwise you're going to be a matter of fact to Texas a city that\nAre in minimum will be an hour away and if you really need serious care it could be four hours away by car so as a result of people feel very isolated they feel that\nA Washington and the federal government and away as not eating their concerns this is a place where up until a couple of years ago the many of the streets were unpaved or in the city literally a a dirt road town so something that you would expect to not necessarily in Texas but much more in Mexico but\nThe narrative is sort of flipped one eighty\nWhy is this now it's interesting that you mentioned the narrative and in fact for health care um Americans having to go across\nSure I understood that correctly that's that's true and I even for a non critical care your your dentist might be there are certainly a other\n... and in daily necessities might be there too so health both in an acute situation but also to and and just keeping yourself a fed keeping your family fed or making sure that that you have the basics of daily life this was a really the reality there and\nIf it becomes more difficult for the cross border flow to\nTo flow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of the minds of the people are ... you were that to come to bear\nOn also seems to again also fly in there and the face of the narrative that we need to quote unquote build the wall\nUm when there's this type of symbiotic relationship going back and forth between these two communities\nYou know Dave you guys are looking at a number of different places around the country um and we'll be focusing on those throughout throughout the week but tell us why you chose the places you chose what is it about these individual places that um tells a story that's different about the nation's war\nOn poverty you alluded to it earlier but yeah Donald Trump or as president has taken a sort of victory lap this summer and into the fall\nSaying that hey the war on poverty has largely been one of the economy is incredible that the stock market is at its highest heights and for many parts of the country that is absolutely true and people are doing extremely well muscle underscore that but\nThere are places that feel incredibly forgotten and that even though things might be great on one coast or another in this big city or that they are struggling and might be an issue of education we go to Yahoo city Mississippi to tell a incredibly heart wrenching story there St Louis Missouri where\nHousing is such an issue on everyone's mind or should I say the lack of\nUh we go to a place like Standing Rock\nPeople feel incredibly disenfranchised to all these places that we may have only gone to sex but representative of many other places throughout the country whether\nIt's the uh the mountains of West Virginia maybe the the rural parts of Florida Gary Indiana Flint, Michigan these are all places that that are struggling that that have a reality that goes against what to what some leaders in Washington would like to have you believe\nWell we've got about a minute left and obviously we've just got a couple of weeks left before the midterm elections what could those elections mean for communities like ...\nAll of this was happening with the backdrop of the mid term election and people have a choice to make their making it now in early voting in some states\nThey will certainly had the opportunity to to make that choice in November ... election day so for places like this are struggling they they face a big question to which is whether they want to participate or even if they can participate the reality for a lot of people\nSimply when you're working three jobs and just trying to make ends meet and keep your head above the poverty line it's very difficult to\nParticipate in such a critical vote as the one that we're facing right\nNow they love and solace the federal politics editor for the center for

writing the Broadway bound musical into proud about the temptations\nServing in the writers' room for the Showtime series shameless she's also authored a series of place that in Detroit a city that's central to her identity oh\nI'm from Detroit and I was born and raised there and my husband's from Detroit in my family lives there and so for me Detroit is personal it's about family\nI always say that Detroit is also a metaphor for black America in this country and then therefore America large I think so when people are looking at the city where sort of looking at\nThe social narrative a a narrative around race in economics and our nation and stuff for me it's important to be writing about that in\nWriting from a place of within a I\nHave so much love for the city because I have so much family there and and I have such a really particular upbringing there and so I don't feel like Detroit has had very human picture painted about it in terms of media exposure\nAnd so for me I Want to be a narrator on the city that's held more humane picture of our city\nIn one of your most recent please you take on the issue that we're calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and I'm at very young ages and um something that's become a huge problem in in the United states\nHow do you take a topic like that and bring it to the stage\nSupport for NPR's brought you by the law firm of ... intellectual property group with offices in Minnesota in Los Angeles Inskeep IP Group aims to help companies leverage the power of patents to protect their innovation you didn't find out more at ... dot com\nSo because of that I I just have a vast knowledge about teaching I spent so much time and so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high school and elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships to to teaching because of that as a public school teachers and private with teaching I've been in both\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really and you have to look at it from really many angles and so my play pipeline is about looking at it through a mother who's trying to raise her son but also a mother who's a teacher and a public school so we get to see\nHer relationship to the public school system her son who goes to a private school and had relationships Tibet private school system and we're looking at\nBasically within the two forms of education how\nInstitutions can fail children an educator\nBoth in the public school maybe infrastructure early but in private schools culturally and both of those things are harmful to young people and can lead them to not having enough space for the total humanity and very most analyses young especially young black and brown boys and our nation and so that was important for me to try to explore\nProducer who is putting the segment together found a an interview that you'd done with NPR and here's where you say I always say that we can't allow ourselves to be cherry picked you know or to be the flavor of the month flavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now\nAs opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think\nYou were referring there to the opportunities the women of color specifically have\nFields tell us a little bit about that what do you see going forward as now a newly minted MacArthur grant awarded the but also as a woman of color play right\n[noise] well I think that change doesn't just looked like putting people on the cover of things or in the on the brochures of things and looks like if a structural change you know you have to change in leadership and we're seeing that evidence and large and small wave and our nation right now right leadership it come from the top down\nAnd so on because that in theater in particular it it means programming is decided by leaders you know how a theater as Ron How they're marketing department as Ron what kind of audience they're bringing in that's all decided by the institution and so it takes people within that institution and leaders within that institution to\nHave a very diverse um background and for women of color\nTo being more positions of power and where they are making those decisions that so I think we need to see\nA shift and that so the work that I Do as an artist my work is on stage but it's not just wanted to stay off of off the stage because it it it's a time in the world while I feel that it doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color to have work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color in the audience there has to be a an entire collective shift\nThat invites audiences of diverse backgrounds into the house to have an experience together that's what makes theater special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for ... I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make that change\nIt starts first and foremost with community development I think that there's an assumption about what people of color will and will not spend their money on and that is ... but by and large because people are not following the buying patterns of people of color to suggest that we don't have the money or won't spend it on things that are the significant is false I ...\nThey can ship that makes people want to spend their money on something that's what the other hadn't figured out but I Do also think affordability of tickets is a big deal and that needs to be that needs to be addressed in theater there there's too much of a disparity between ticket prices especially when you're talking about Broadway but the biggest thing I think it's community development which means\nYou cannot expect people to come to you\nLeave their communities to come over to see something at your house if you are not ever willing to go to them\nYou have to be willing to take work out and said their community\nOffered them something for free I always use it in terms of like food I say you know why would I leave my house I Know that I can cook [laughter] I have my food so it comes to your house in each of food and I don't even know that you can cook and you brought me they're all samples\nLike why would I spend money for it comes to your house to eat your food and I don't even know that I like your food that doesn't make sense you have to you have to tell me give me some samples to bring me out and show me that\nI'm not just a flavor but somebody that you're really trying to cultivate a meaningful relationship with that is the kind of thing that I think is missing and that we have to start doing and being way more active about\nDominique Marie so is a playwright whose work includes skeleton crew and pipelines thank you so much so many thank you\n\nThat takes away we'll be right back and bring us let you on the go subscribed to the take away some hard hats on I tunes or wherever you get your podcasts [noise]\n\nProgramming is supported by ... architects committed to creating thoughtfully crafted intimately connected designed solutions for a wide range of architectural projects more at S.
