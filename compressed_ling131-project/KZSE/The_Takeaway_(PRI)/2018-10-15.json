this year that number is much higher than the original twenty five hundred reported\nIn an interview with Lesley Stahl from CBS is sixty minutes President Trump was asked if he would repeat the policy\nWhen you allow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into our country are you gonna go back to them well we'll look at that a lot

officials allowed on the premise is once before but it was very tightly controlled started more of a curated fewer than an investigation keep in mind that the Saudis have had almost two weeks to\nMake whatever preparations they might mean to you in order to ensure that this investigation um wouldn't go favorably for them so it's perhaps a positive development by you know we should be definitely be

woman governor if elected\nBut activists are suing Kemp who as secretary of state oversees the voting system\nThey claim some fifty three thousand voter registration applicants are on hold the majority of those are for black voters camp says that he is not intentionally trying to diminish the black vote for his own gain in the election\nThe takeaway reached out to his campaign and they responded to our email calling this a quote manufactured crisis created by Stacey Abrams and used by Abrams to fire up her base of supporters\nAndra Gillespie is an associate professor of political science at Emory University Andre welcome to the takeaway thank you for having me when we hear about a efforts to disenfranchise Georgia voters what exactly are we talking about here can you tell us what these fifty three thousand applications actually are\nWell in this case it is the issue of ... match so when people fill out butter registration applications that they may leave out ... or I'm a accent marks\nAnd there's also the possibility for human errors if you fill out a paper application form and it goes to your county elections office and somebody actually forgets to put the hype and enter forgets to put the apostrophe and\nThen um after that they check the name against 'em some type of a special government records like a driver's license record or perhaps a Social Security record\nIf the name has not been transcribed identically to what is actually on your other government id record then that application is flagged as needing additional verification um and in the state of Georgia you have\nA certain period of time about two years to be able to uh go and get that corrupted before you'll officially be added to the voter rolls as as a voter um this is a longer period\nThe office had been sued and reached a settlement with various civil rights groups to try to remove exact match 'em up but then the state re inscribed into law and just gave a longer period by which people have to sort of prove um how they spelled their name correctly\nAnd I have a question about the fifty three thousand do how does Kemp explained that the majority of these if we're accurate on this are for black Georgians well\nHe can't say he's not going to say that it was intended to be that way it's just a question of the effect and so people of color so not just African Americans but also Latino and Asian Americans are more likely to have their names flag does not hitting meeting the exact much standards as opposed to lights\nBut for what purpose I mean our our names that different I'm just trying to understand why these groups are targeted more\nSo um you know these are names that might not transcribe well so if you have an unusual spellings non western names that people aren't familiar with you can see it an instance where Mary and Joseph and and John I'm are more familiar to people where somebody who has a hyphen or an apostrophe or an unusual spelling of their name\nMy accidentally be transcribed from paper into the electronic database incorrectly and that's more likely to hit people of color\nOn drew when uh we we were talking about uh the camp a camp and what their reaction has been to this and when they've been confronted with accusations that they that the camp camp it actually engaged in\nDisenfranchisement one of the things they point to is that they've actually increase the number of voters in Georgia by one million people just sat defense work here [noise]\nUm I'm not sure that it works here I mean I think we have to ask a question about if there's a particular verification practice that has a disparate impact on people of color it might a stand to reason to that you might want to revisit that particular policy\nSo it's great that there are more voters and the state I'm I'm Stacey Abrams would actually probably argue that ah she and her campaign helped contribute to that increase in voter registration but we do need to
