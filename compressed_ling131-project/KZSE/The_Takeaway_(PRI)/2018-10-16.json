contested claim that she has Native American ancestry with results from a DNA test and the telling of her family story\nMy mother was born in the eastern Oklahoma\nIt had been Indian Territory until just a few years earlier when you become\nMy daddy always said he fell head over heels in love with my first time you are\nBut my daddy's parents the hearings were bitterly today are married 'cause my mother's family read was part Native American\nPresident Trump has long punted warns claims of native ancestry and even nicknamed her Pocahontas the accusations surrounding warns ancestry date back to two thousand and twelve when her Republican challenger for the Senate Scott Brown accused warn of using her Native American heritage to advance her career\n... brewer is a contributing editor for tribal affairs at high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation Hi Graham right what was your reaction to Elizabeth Warren's decision to take this test and put out this video I thought it was very interest\nSupport comes from urban homework stable homes offer long term positive effects on families consider joining the stability makers a group of donors who believe in the power of equitable and dignified homes for everyone urban home works dot org backslash donate\nMore and and also President Trump has been very problematic from the beginning and I think using a DNA test to\nValidate that history was probably the wrong approach\n[noise] it's interesting there because you don't want to criticize that gets her intentions for doing this but then it was actually what she did write the message the way that it was done was the issue a DNA test itself was it that it was covered up by the media inappropriately\nIt's all of the above when we're covering Indian country weren't covering tribal communities we have to take not just look at the language we use but the way we talk about them the problem I had with senator warns approach was that it kind of fosters a narrative that has damaging to native people\nTo give you a little bit of context I I have a very similar story to Senator Warren I Am not much darker than she is a outwardly the place for that video shot is probably just a couple of miles from my home I live in Norman, Oklahoma and that's where I'm Talking to you from now\nAnd so I don't fault her for wanting to know more about her history or in fact I Would encourage her to do so but I I think when you invite people to talk about the degree of of your blood quantum which is the degree of your Indian blood which is something that is documented by the government\nIn in my case certainly you're opening up two conversations that feed into stereotypes and myths about native people blood quantum is a very uh ... subject it's an institution of colonialism it was something that was put in place to essentially weed out\nSo by putting a stop on me a degree to which you're allowed to join your tribe which is a choice that tribes are able to make as they are sovereign nations\nThen it makes it less likely that your children will be able to be tribal members if they don't have the same amount of Indian blood is you do my tribe for instance the Cherokee Nation we don't have a blood quantum so as long as you can prove lineage you are a member\nUm to say that someone who is one eighth as more of a say or is more native than someone who is one thirty second for instance\nI I think is wrong I'm we're not just talking about a racial distinction here we're talking about a political distinction this was a citizenship question I Am a citizen of a sovereign nation as well as being a descendent of an indigenous person\nSo we've been hearing throughout Indian country that it's not uncommon to have to travel twenty forty miles to vote and there are some egregious examples\nI for example in Nevada in death valley voters have to travel as far as a hundred and fifty miles round trip in order to cast a vote a which equates to on a good day about four and a half hours of travel time\nOne of the things that we noticed in in North Dakota was that this ruling essentially would borrow make it more difficult for people with just a PO box address to vote rather than those that have a residential street address is that something that you're seeing in other states\nYes it's starting to become a problem um there is a housing crisis on a Native American reservations in twenty Seventeen for about eleven thousand members of the northern Iraq ... ah in Wyoming there were just two hundred and thirty\nLead to averaging about forty eight people her home and so this housing crisis is creating a problem where Native Americans don't have\nA residential street address it because they're moving from home to home but also in these remote areas of those homes may not even have an address on them to begin with um and so it's literally impossible for people to comply with\nA residential street address requirement um and instead they're depending upon PO box is\nWhich have a lot of flaws in order to conduct their affairs and so these kind of barriers to housing are gonna start translating to barriers to the ballot box if we don't create a system that that doesn't rely on residential street addresses\nWhy are we only having this conversation now I feel like the timing of this decision and everything else just seems like uh there should be some some system in place for this community I mean this isn't something that just happened the other day\nNo I mean they'd American right son we've been litigating this case since twenty fourteen we saw in the in that election we saw widespread disenfranchisement\nOf the native community uh and so uh you know we immediately filed suit we received relief from the law and twenty sixteen because the federal district court found that it was in fact discriminatory\nUm and that I had to burn some impact on Native Americans the legislator slightly tweaked the law\nIn twenty Seventeen or the district court again found that that law was discriminatory because it kept the discriminatory features which are the ... presidential address and the you know IDs that were you know really strict in number and hard to get a you know Native American issues are often under reported\nUm you know over the past year we've conducted a series of field hearings around Indian country to sort of ask\nWhat are these barriers that are keeping you from voting and um this is you know one of the first time\nJen Jacqueline deli out as a member of the is let up ... and staff attorney at

having me on so let's start with the basics what is the economic relationship between the U.S and Saudi Arabia and what are some of the major ...\nTo exchange\nWell as you mentioned uh the ... economic relationship goes back decades and it's it's founded on oil basically um the Saudis sit on one of the largest oil deposits in the world and have been one of the leading exporters of oil a for decades\nBut recently and they and they realize that there was oil reserves aren't going to last forever and so they've\nTaken steps to try and diversify their economy I'm also another factor in it is but the U.S is producing more and more or oil through fracking and other means that make it less reliant on Saudi oil\nAnd so in some cases the Saudis have been diversify that economy to other areas
