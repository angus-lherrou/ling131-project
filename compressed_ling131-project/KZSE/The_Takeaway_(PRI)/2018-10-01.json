working at a night club and\nShe was an aspiring models slash actress and\nShe was there this was just before he was going to be traded to Manchester United so she was there to party which is a policy I guess you get to his entourage so he according to deter Spiegel article and her account she noticed her pulled her aside and she was\nHeard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't sure\nAnd then he got her number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warnings for anyone listening he was very aggressive she I'm brutally assaulted her and even

that needed to be but I mean she was an aspiring actress you didn't have twenty thousand dollars for a retainer [laughter] so I mean this is part of the problem with this system\nShore and this is a this is not the first time that they're Spiegel has written about this they wrote about this back in twenty Seventeen where has the U.S media been on this story it this is something that happened in Las Vegas Nevada um where have we been on this story\nAnd I will say this very honestly as because I'm part of the problem I'm part of sports media this has been nowhere and I absolutely find media and mainstream media football media particularly to be complicit in this rape culture because this is first of all not the first time he's ever been in\nSupport for NPR's brought you by the law firm

at ... dot com different outlets and got one yes\nSo nobody was interested in it either they said it's not our beat or we don't know the reason football media is reluctant to do this is because\nLet's not forget that Cristiano Ronaldo has an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representatives you're in trouble\nI mean he's played for some of the biggest teams in the world\nI mean I don't know and that applies to us media where football flash soccer is not um as popular here I Would argue as maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think this is applicable here it as well\nAbsolutely because I mean I I pitched us outlet [laughter] and no one wanted was humorous nobody wanted the story and I'm like how can this not be possible but this is the first time this happened to me the same thing with David ... the current goalkeeper for Manchester United was also just before the euro's implicated in a very brutal rape\nCase the sexual assault of two workers sex workers that we we should also\nBe clear though that that he that run although has responded and denying these allegations right\nOf course is going to deny them I mean he called them fake news but before he denies them let's not forget that he paid Catherine my work out three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and in NDA\nLike let's not forget that that happened and she has the documentation\nI mean now she's finally got appropriate legal counsel but the thing is is that your speakers would not and this is something we have to address and we talk about media would not have printed that saved da da da and cross the T's and legal has gone over this a hundred times if Christie honor and all those team was going to sue ...

come out in the sports world and other issues so I'm I'm really surprised at the lack of attention from the American media here\nI'm not it was the same thing with David ... and look what happened

said yeah I'm the wars or listen for that and all the News Tomorrow morning\n\nI'm tansy and Vega here with you on the takeaway\nStarting today's sixteen year old and New York state will no longer automatically be charged as adults in criminal court next to the so called raise the age legislation passed last year\nAs a result sixteen and Seventeen year old being detained at New York city's notorious Rikers Island jail have to be moved out by today in New York in North Carolina where the last two states in the nation to make this change\nHere to bring us up to speed on these two huge changes to New York criminal justice system is our dear friend Cindy Rodriguez than he covers urban affairs here in our WNYC newsroom and you've heard her on this show before Cindy thanks for being with us high tends to be here so what exactly are the changes going into effect\nToday one is regarding housing and the other one is how the six\nThat's correct so said this law will ultimately affect sixteen and Seventeen year olds and but they're phasing it and said this is the start of the loss of this is the first phase of the law so if you're arrested and you're sixteen years old today\nUm and it's a misdemeanor crime your case will automatically go to family court if it's a felony case you're um it will go to adult criminal court now there's been a specially youth part that's been developed in adult criminal court\nUm it's the case involves sexual assaults if it involves any serious physical injury if it involves a weapon\nUm it will stay in this youth part an adult criminal court\nOtherwise it will go to family court unless a prosecutor claims there's extraordinary circumstances and the judge agrees with that than the case will stay\nAnd what about this move that at the sixteen and Seventeen year olds don't have to be moved out of Rikers Island which we know has been the center of so much controversy around or just how people have been treated at the at the facility et cetera\nSo it's a day to day and what's happening yes that's true too so another thing to mention is that this law has not retroactive so that means if you're already serving in prison sentence you're staying in state prison\nIt also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained in Rikers Island and just to give a free or national audience a sense of what Rikers Island is it's the second largest jail system in the country\nUm it's known to be a very violent and chaotic place\nSo if you are there and that means that you're awaiting trial you haven't been convicted of anything um your case will continue through the adult criminal justice system but you will be moved off the island and in fact as of yesterday I was told that all Ninety three sixteen and Seventeen year olds that were on Rikers Island are now\nWhere they're going to go so they're going to a facility called horizon said this is a long standing juvenile detention facility in the Bronx and so they've all been moved there\nNow why this pushed for this change I mean was there something about the way sixteen and Seventeen year olds in particular were being treated at Rikers were they not getting sufficient help what prompted this uh this change\n[noise] so there's there's been said the laws years in the making and the backdrop to it is that um I Believe it was about in twenty fourteen when federal prosecutors started investigating how sixteen and Seventeen year olds were being treated\n'em an Rikers Island and they found that guards were using excessive force on them they were striking them in the had repeatedly they were over using solitary confinement\nUm and so that was part of the effort to get them off of Rikers Island I'm In addition to that we have this young man named ... Browder who is in Rikers in ... he was arrested for stealing a backpack\nUm that case was ultimately dismissed but he stayed there for three years he was in solitary confinement he was attacked by other inmates and by correction officers and he was very traumatized by that experience um he was out on Pete his family couldn't meet that three thousand dollars bail\nSo when he came out um his story was told by the journalist Jennifer Gunderman from the New Yorker it got a lot of attention\nUm then he started suffering a lot with mental health issues and ultimately he killed himself so all of that is sort of the backdrop of where we are today\nThere's been lots of talk particularly from uh New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio on a larger plan to essentially shutdown Rikers Island um it's\nOf course we're all those folks would end up is is probably going to be contested very hotly how does this fit into that larger picture is this may be one of the early steps in shutting down Rikers\nWell it sits in in the sense that in order to closed down Rikers um the city needs to drop the population of people that are in jail by about half they need to drop it to about five thousand\nSo um [noise] this is one group of people that are now off Rikers Island and you mention that to move people off the jails is to close down records of who's going to be controversial so the plan is that the city wants to close Rikers Island and then open up\nNew jails in Burroughs um cities would be ... that are more integrated into the community um to do that um they go through sort of a public hearing process and there's been hearings already and the different neighborhoods where these jails are flooded for and there's been\nTremendous opposition so far\nWhat about you mentioned ... brought her and I think that that's a fascinating and really important part of this conversation do we is there any talk about ending cash bail as opposed to just moving people\nIn and out [noise] um right so there is a whole debate about it and an effort to change the way the bail system works in New York\nUm a lot of that change requires action from the state legislator which um seems like it won't happen there is though something pretty interesting that it's actually happening today too which is there is\nThis mass and bailout that's being planned by the Robert Kennedy human rights foundation and said that um mass bailout is targeting sixteen and Seventeen year olds and women who are incarcerated um there's about five that's about five hundred people um\nAnd the ... supposed to happen through out the month of October um and today was is the first day that we're expected to see some of these people being bailed out\nAnd I just want to let our listeners know that we did reach out to the mayor's office for comment and they told us and we are quoting\nThe city is very clear on the east coast of raise the age that kids should be treated as kids every part of the planning process has been guided by this city Rodriguez covers urban affairs for WNYC thanks for joining us Cindy thank you tend to you know\n\nGot a comment for this show up on our Facebook page tweet us ... or leave us a voice mail at age seven seven eight might take your ideas I have a huge part of who we are let us know what you're thinking about this is the takeaway [noise]\n...
