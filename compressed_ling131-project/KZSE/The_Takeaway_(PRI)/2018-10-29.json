I think that one would see that as terrorism if it has a political intense and the reason I'm emphasizing that is of course a little bit more than a year ago a shooter at the Las Vegas hotel\nUh open fire on concert goers and killed nearly sixty people that has never terrorize people may have caused profound fear and anxiety in the United states amongst people who gather the public venues that because of the firearms laws in this country that they could be\nVictims of such attacks but we still year later do not know the motive or the intention of the shooter and that's why that has never being labeled terrorists\nI mean I Want to stop you right now we will never know the motive and I think that's what's most frustrating for a lot of people when we often don't know the motives for example\nAnd assume that they're just anti American is something that I think comes up often in conversation but we won't know the motive of the Las Vegas shooter because that person is no longer here when these folks take their own lives when they commit violent acts in public why is that not considered a terrorist attack [noise]\nWhite but even people who perished in the course of their attacker commit suicide immediately afterwards\nOn occasion have ... have put it in the context of some political cause or of allegiance to or belief in support of the ideology of a movement\nAnd an instance where we just have someone randomly opening fire without putting in that context in the legal context that can't be terrorists but you're absolutely right and the normative sense what society regards as terrorism is something obviously very very different\n[noise]\nAnd we're hearing from you do you feel like hate is on the rise in this country he's\nVery when calling us from Brighton, Michigan have is just being unleashed we'd never shortage in this country it's just the wisest\nAges Dore Gold and we haven't had a\nDent in the media working together in concert promoter in a long time my name's Emma and I live in Portland, Oregon and I've seen first hand just how much vocal hate groups have become in the last year\nTwo years since the election had friends who've been tear gas during protests against the Proud Boys it's definitely a scary time here\nI Am calling from Ohio Neal I Do not think that hate is on the rise the news just pays attention to your regularly to splashy offense my name is Amy plaster calling from high ridge Missouri I Believe the ignorance that isolation is on the rise\nHate is just one byproduct of this problem is is that the ...\nAnd I think it's the same amount of hate we've always had however before now people knew it wasn't acceptable\nBy the ... took out nasty thing I don't believe that either hate crimes I Believe that they are terrorism\nHi this is living from Monroe North Carolina there has always been hate but we have to rise above that and be the best person we can be but you have to love our neighbor support our families and look out for each other\nBy my name is wary so sure I'm calling from Brooklyn New York the rule never be gun control in this country that they will always be gone out of control [noise] the thing that Americans can do is hope that their witness to some gun shooting and the they don't get shot\nTo this lottery right\nNow my name is Bridget I live in Pittsburgh, PA\nSquirrels hill area and I'm\nReally angry and really sad and it was very frightening [noise] but it also proved\nTo me how strong our community is when everybody turned out for the vigil last night and it's just making us stronger we all need to be together and I think the most\nImportant thing is we have to start voting for people to get in office that will change the gun law and I don't want to live under a military state so I don't think are new guards are\nYour thoughts are on the violence in the past week joined in on the conversation on the take away the Facebook page\n[noise]\n\n\nOr food comes from babble language of the teachers real life conversations new language like Spanish French German ...
