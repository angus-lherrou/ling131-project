light on some of the poorest communities in the United states just months after the president's council of economic advisors declared that the war on poverty was largely over\nThat narrative neglect the stories of countless Americans still struggling under crushing economic conditions\nAnd today we turn to a community in North Carolina where natural disasters\nAnd poor governmental response have exposed the depths of that suffering\nMorning it's Columbus our share of course our living alone so a cow and march first term Avon storms may just or\nHurricane Florence made landfall in the Carolinas last month and the devastation brought back painful memories from just two years earlier when Hurricane Matthew tore through the area the first category five Atlantic hurricane in nearly ten years\nFor residents of lumber to North Carolina in rural ... county the devastation was inescapable\nArch it affected everyone Mac show which it affect that face\nI Wish it was just deja vu for these residents the damage was just horrible\nThat's Ashley ... a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity and I talked to her about reporting in Lumberton and whether or not residents stories were reflected in the rose the economic picture touted by the Trump Administration lumber\nTen North Carolina it's a it's one of the most diverse rural counties in the country actually um you have about a third white a third black a third lumpy Native American and a growing Hispanic population so it it's a very interesting kind of make up there\nAnd of course we're looking at the series through the sort of idea that the president of the United states has recently and said that we solved the war on poverty that we are good when it comes to poverty but Lumberton is actually one of the poorest and on healthiest and most dangerous counties in North Carolina tell us about what that looks like\nYeah so I visited twice or the summer in the fall first to kind of see what the town looked like after being hit by Hurricane Matthew twenty sixteen and you could still see a lot of the destruction from that long ago you would see\nPiles of sand that had come from under the river that people hadn't cleared out I'm Still some furniture laying out some houses that just were very dilapidated and some areas where they had already torn down the entire house and there was just a green space\nAnd what about the impact of Hurricane Florence yeah\nSo they got pummeled again I'm almost two years to the day um which was just horrible because when I was there in July you would still see all of this destruction but I was talking to a lot of people who are finally getting their lives back\nHer the day that she got into her new home that was just rebuilt and then Florence hit and the same thing happens all over again her houses was flooded and I heard that story time and time again\nAnd are there any people or groups in particular that these residents would like to see more from I'm Wondering about FEMA um or any other organizations\nFEMA's down of ground Red Cross has been on the ground there was an issue with Hurricane Matthew with HUD money with housing and urban development money that hadn't come through from the state\nI think about ten percent of the money that was gifted from the federal government was actually distributed so people are saying well okay the money hasn't calm that time around then and that's two years later so what's going to happen with Hurricane Florence money um how would I was going to work\nSo Chris Howard the lumberjack resident we heard from earlier echoed those same concerns in trying to get help rebuilding his house\nAbout it but now it just gets medication stage [noise]\nWe don't know what was going to happen because they're telling me that they have fought for Eric rich default\nI talked to many residents that one either or to discourage to even apply for aid because they were told that they would never get it denials are very frequent FEMA admits that and they say you just have to apply again but that's really discouraging to residents\nOne person that I spend a lot of time with a mistake and Powell she actually went back and forth with FEMA twelve different times talking to different representatives having to tell her story again hearing conflicting things you need this piece of information you need this to the point where she just gave up on that\nA lot of people that need it the most that were really hit badly and are in shelters are staying with family members the system isn't really working from them and the way that it's meant to\nThis is a district that was reliably democratic but did end up voting for President Trump who has said as we mentioned earlier that the war on poverty has over is that a disconnect for the residents of Lumberton also at the time\nBut it was very interesting I as I said before just showing up matters and during the hurricane a lot of the people I talked to said we saw Donald Trump's bus we saw the big name Trump on the side of the bus we saw Lara Trump passing out water bottles to us and that was really memorable and we didn't see Hillary Clinton\nDonald Trump also was kind of talking to the points that really resonated with Rob a Sony and such as I'm going to get rid of NAFTA or a lot of people say took a ton of them and you factoring jobs out of the county um I'm not sure\nHow much they think that he's held up their promises but at the time he seemed to be speaking right to them\nAnd where does Lumberton go from here obviously there are mid term elections coming up in a couple of weeks though there's probably still a lot more recovery to be done where do they go from here\nYeah so that's something I was trying to piece together when I was there because you still have hundreds of people in shelters I'm and maybe voting is the last thing on their minds are they weren't really politically engaged to begin with that is one of the reasons we chose Robison county they have a very low turnout rate\nYou're trying to rebuild you may not be living in your house you maybe with a family member\nSo board of elections are saying well we can send you an absentee ballot you can vote from anywhere we're sending them to shelters we've extended the voter registration date by three days but people are that\nCome out for this election if they're if they're angry enough with being hit twice in two years and don't feel like they've been paid attention to is that if that will matter or if again they're just going to be
