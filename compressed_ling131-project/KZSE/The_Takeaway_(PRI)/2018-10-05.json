square and the space of saying\nHey I think a huge part of the problem is this position of district attorney and when you have a district attorney in a city or county\nWho doesn't really see justice the way you see it justice can be nearly impossible and um I've done my life in to try to elect progressive reform minded compassionate district attorneys all over the country\nDid you know anything about how district attorneys work how they get into their positions any of that\nNo I I really didn't and I don't think most Americans fully understand\nWhat the position of district attorney is what responsibilities they have and just how much influence and power and uh and how much leeway they have in what cases they pursue how they pursue them what cases they drop\nAnd um it was really in twenty four team that I first came face to face with that reality in in four different cases with the case of Eric Garner the case of John Crawford the case of Mike Brown and then the case of Tamir Rice and Cleveland when I came to understand and they and it it took me\nIs that the entire world can be incredibly frustrated and deeply agitated about a single case of injustice and we could have the top trending topic in the world we could be on the front cover of every newspaper\nBut if the local district attorney doesn't feel the same way justice can be nearly impossible\nSo let's go to the numbers for a minute Sean at that how ... how they get into their possessions [noise] how many district attorneys are there in this country and are they all elected\nYeah so there are right now there and write about twenty five hundred district attorneys all over the country and while the policies governing them vary from city to city county to county state to state effectively your local district attorney\nNormally functions in a city wide or county wide capacity and with the exception of of a few states where the governor gets to appoint those district attorneys\nThey are elected locally and they normally are elected even in places that are highly engaged like like New York city they're normally elected by\nJust three or four percent of local people who show up to vote and so the overwhelming majority of district attorneys literally are elected wants and often run on opposed sometimes not just for a few terms but for decades in\nSome states they are non partisan positions are in others they run as Democrats or Republicans and uh when I say that out loud most people around the country and around the world rather gas because the the\nAnd the country are appointed nonpartisan positions so the idea that the person who's overseeing their local justice system is an elected partisan shocks people\nUm I think some of the challenge comes in here they are Ninety five percent white those twenty five hundred people they are nearly Ninety percent male\nUh and they are overwhelmingly conservative and what we're saying is hey\nWe can change the system's a little bit from the outside but that's not nearly as effective as what we can do inside of these positions and so we're trying to encourage people hey you need to consider running for district attorney\nWell let's talk about one of those places where you got involved in Dallas County Calif a little bit about the candidate that you back and what happened in that race\nWhat we saw in Dallas and in other cities and
