cross the border alone\nThe federal government is increasingly relying on makeshift tent cities for these kids one is in New York Texas and one ...\nFirst time the federal government has used tempting

has more than twelve thousand eight hundred kids in its custody that's five times as many as last year how did we get here\nOne topic the stats as is now well over thirty thousand according to numbers I got yesterday uh children have been crossing the border unaccompanied from Central America in large numbers sense around two thousand four key mark and talk about how the Obama administration dealt with it\nBut the Trump Administration has changed some policies you have\nOverall sort of this climate out there that makes immigrant families very unlikely to step forward and try to take\nOf these children who arrive at the border on a company and then you had the implementation of very specific policies\nParticularly a new requirement that any family that wants to sponsor one of these children who arrives at the border without a parent or guardian which is usually another family member must now submit their fingerprints to ice as well as the fingerprints of any adult in the household\nMost of these families of course have at least one undocumented member in the household and this is just had a massive chilling effect on the willingness of these families to take these children and so they're sitting in federal custody which increasingly\nMeans thousands of them are sitting in the east\nAre either in the desert here in Texas or or out in homestead Florida market when I ask we're

over the city and eventually all over the country\nPouring out into the streets and asking really for the first time for change for freedoms for an end to police and military brutality\nFor the president of Mexico to step down for authoritarianism to end it was exciting and powerful kind of civic movement that really had no precedent in Mexico\nAnd that a movement attracted a lot of anger from the Mexican government and slowly over the course of the summer and into the fall of the movement grew in strength and the demands became sharper and more articulated\nThe government began to crack down and the crackdown culminated after months of back and forth between the government and the students with the terrible shoot out a massacre that took place during the protest meeting in the public square at ... in ...\nDozens of students and bystanders were killed and injured [noise]\nThere were reports at the time that arms snipers were up in surrounding buildings and shot towards the

the students themselves had been firing from\nThe building overlooking the square to simply wasn't true it was a lie and what actually happened which we discovered slowly over the years that in fact the president had placed snipers in those buildings that overlooks the square where we're at ten thousand\nStudents and other people were gathered to protest\nAnd that they had fired down into the crowd in order to create a kind of chaos which would then permit the military to move in and arrest hundreds of people which is in fact what happened\nEarly in September this year we saw major student
