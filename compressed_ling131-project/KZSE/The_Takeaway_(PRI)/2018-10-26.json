Seventy five oh because my husband insists I'd much prefer to go the normal by and see all my friends\nIs that honest enough for you Kristen Williams\nThan a typical midterm election that we've had over the last three decades\nSasha I remember I'm old enough to remember maybe you do to reading a lot in twenty six teen especially via Twitter a campaign folks in Florida especially those affiliated\nWith the Clinton campaign who said oh my gosh are early vote is so good we have bad more votes more or less\nSign that Hillary Clinton's going to win Florida and of course it didn't exactly work out that way so again as we are going into the next couple of weeks here trying to analyze the numbers that are coming out what do we have to be careful to look for so that we don't end up in the same place\nSo you know a lot of the public facing data will see the party registration of people who have already cast ballots the race or ethnicity in some states um we should not assume that those are monolithic groups not everybody who was registered as a Democrat in Florida or has a history of voting in the Democratic primary state\nIs going to cast the ballot for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump prefer given Democratic Senate candidate over given Republican candidate so just looking at you know who's winning in terms of a more registered Democrats are registered Republicans cast ballots has all the problems that that you could infer I mean we're keeping in mind especially with twenty sixteen is\nHow late movement in an election intersects with with early vote so you know the second call me letter came out right around this time or in\nA two years ago and so you know as we look at news events you know I don't know the caravan I guess and and the Republican messaging on that or or the president claiming he's going to issue a new tax cut things that we think might have some persuasive power over\nOver voters we should remember that a significant number of votes had been cast before those events to take place and I think that that's something that twenty sixteen should be instructive on and give us a bit of caution of assuming that the that the entirety of the electorate is thinking the same about both candidates on on October twentieth as as they are November sex\nWe have to take a short break more with Michael McDonald and Sasha Eisenberg coming up this is the take away\nYour tuned to Minnesota Public radio news and the take away friday with political analyst Amy Walter\nNews coverage of business in the economy and supported by only ... life dedicated to helping Americans protect their family\n... promises kept on line at all the ... life dot com [noise]\nAirbag with politics with Amy Walter on the take away [noise] we continue our look at the historic levels of early voting\nThis year with Michael McDonald fans Sasha Eisenberg Michael Sasha disagreed about the importance of the early vote tally that's far which Michael told me is exceeding presidential election levels in some places [noise]\nBut we've heard about the importance of early voting before like say the twenty sixteen election so sure about the danger of misinterpreting the pre election day\nYou know a lot of the public facing data will see the party registration of people who have already cast ballots the race or ethnicity in some states we should not assume that those are mind with the groups not everybody who was registered as a Democrat in Florida or has a history of voting and the Democratic primary in a state\nIs going to cast the ballot for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump prefer given Democratic Senate candidate over given Republican candidate so just looking at you know who's winning in terms of a more registered Democrats are registered Republicans cast\nBallots has all the problems are that that you could infer the author worth keeping in mind especially with twenty sixteen is\nHow late movement in an election intersects with with early vote so you know the second call me letter came out right around this time two years ago\nAnd so you know as we look at news events you know I don't know the caravan I guess and and the Republican messaging on that or or the president claiming he's going to issue a new tax cut things that we think might have some persuasive power over over voters we should remember that a significant number of votes had been cast before those events take place and\nI think that that's something that twenty sixteen should be instructive on and give us a bit of caution\nMichael is there a difference between people who show up to vote early you have states that allow you to come and vote\nStay versus those states where you can vote via the mail you get an absentee ballot sent to you\nRight so when we first respond to that question you just posed which is the election forecasting question\nAnd a good weekend before the election and twenty I'm sixteen I didn't and also since the early vote in the states where we're we're getting higher early voting numbers\nAnd um you know by and large we correctly predicted over what was going to happen and the twenty six you know watching the Vatican Colorado where we get very high levels of early voting\nA correctly protected those are states and then our correctly predicted how Trump would have to win the election which was you would have to when I Want to do slow on early voting states like Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin He ended up running all three of them on but again I I I think some there's some\nValue in the signals that we're getting from the early voting data and that really plays into the the question that you asked me which is that I guess there are actually on differences in the way in which\nPeople participate or Republicans tend to vote by mail that's not a universal truths\nThe Democrats tend to vote in person early and there's this uh this pattern that you see in the early vote on as you get closer to election day that's why I'm saying what else I'm not drawing ... says about what's happening in Europe and by the end of next week once we get the in person early voting in number of states um will be able to tell what's happened\nSocial what about early vote and the impact on some underrepresented groups thinking about voters of color or younger people are people who maybe aren't frequent voters is there any evidence or anything that you're seeing in terms of campaign strategy\nThat is aimed at using the early vote to get those voters engage in\nThe election definitely democratic campaigns that that are focusing either mobilization strategies see early voting as far more friendly to\nAnd you know are developing refining get out the vote tactics there's been this sort of culture of of plan making which is a tool that that comes out of uh the behavioral science is get people to visualize how they're going to get to the polls what time they are going to go how they're going to get there um some campaigns calling people back or sending them a reminder of the plant that they had made\nAs more sort of path to open up for people to vote\nThe thinking as it is more conducive to the lifestyles of of people who may have multiple jobs are are going to school in odd hours you know and I think that there are a lot of opportunities with very targeted digital advertising to take advantage of of the sort of\nLonger window and the knowledge in some cases about who's voting who hasn't run really tailor campaigns at the voters are still outstanding\nAnd Michael if you can you know kind of think into the future down the road maybe ten years or more is this what we're going to be done in that election day itself is just one day on the calendar and that the majority of people voting in this country are going to vote before the election even happened\nAnd and that's the way we used to build a long time ago back\nBefore Eighteen forty five and we said the uniform day for voting elections were held ... days and that was to help you the opportunity to travel from rural areas into the county\nCourthouse to vote on and so on this has nothing to do we added for our time in our history of our country and then we start having it for a while and we started having a jet stream of Nineteen seventies on state started with the monitoring their\nEarly voting laws to permit first on no excuse absentee voting and there was a permanent absentee voting and\nSo many um voters were voting by mail in states like Oregon and Washington that the oceans shows they're just sort of threw up their hands and said why are we having these point locations and they're very expensive I was just moved on male elections and so on that trend started out west\nThe states you hold on a milk powder actions we've got a California are\nComing online an option for the Allen Institute is there some restaurants this time around but\nBy twenty twenty we should see many more counties in California other ballot jurisdictions places like New Jersey and ah and for the two states that I Would say that we're going to see more and more male balloting and that's going to you again street eventually I can to perhaps on el Balad elections you can go to a vote center like you're\nSort of like a Super Bowl and ... and a and vote in person that you wish producer so it's not just a\nAn all male about elections the other innovation that's happening in West Virginia that were nurturing voters are allowed to buy an app\nOn and so will monitor and see how that works this time around um but that's most were voting innovations have come through the military first so that's something else to be looking for in the next Twenty years to other states or adopting a adopting I'm a I\nFor a for military voters and and do they start offering that option to a domestic civilian voters as well\nMichael Sasha thanks so much for joining me thanks Amy thank you Michael McDonald is a professor at the University of Florida and founder of the U.S elections project and Sasha Eisenberg is author of the victory lap [noise]\nComing up this hour there's no historical precedent for that we had never seen before we'll hear about how huge sums of money in this year's elections are affecting early voting in voter turnout also look at whether Trump supporters will come out in large numbers when the president isn't on the ballot\nWho's trying to take out Ted Cruz might be the latest example of that because even though he's got more money than he could probably even spend in these final weeks\nHe's still running up against a math problem that isn't isn't it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "city": "Rochester", "day": "26"}
