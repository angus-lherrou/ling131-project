means we're two years out from the twenty sixteen campaign if you can believe that when then candidate Donald Trump ran on a series of promises to the American people\nTell the president of courses and on the ballot this year but I mean the term election is kind of like those mid term tests you took back in school there the first real assessment of all you've done in class for the first part of the semester\nAnd they're supposed to get you ready for the big one final\nVoters use the midterm elections to send a message to the president they take a look back at the last two years and greatest the more unhappy they are with the president the more likely they vote against members of his party in November\nHappy with him they support the members of his party\nOne way voters evaluate how a president is doing this to look at whether he's fulfill the promises he made us candidate but we also know voters evaluate the president on more than just policy they look at things like leadership temperament comport themselves on the job\nBut today's episode will specifically look at what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail and whether he's comes through on those commitments\nAnd there's a lot to get into [noise]\n\nWe begin with foreign policy so I Do believe that Trump has had an extremely consequential\nForeign policy presidency so far in ways that are often underrated by the way both by critics of his and buy some orders that Susan Glasser staff writer for the New Yorker he has almost singlehandedly because even his own party largely does not support much of this agenda on foreign policy in particular\nHe is more or less singlehandedly\nReorientate American foreign policy it seems to me away from me rules based or values based foreign policy and toward an extremely transactional unilateral view of the United states in the world are much more ...\nThe might rule the strong do as they will kind of view of the world\nPresident Trump bran on a few key promises when it comes to foreign policy one and the most important in all real dealings he'd put America First\nThe U.S had become too attached a multinational relationships deals that weren't directly benefiting the U.S he also insisted that under his leadership the world would respect us again an idea premised on the false notion that the world did not respect the United states before\nWe are going to do something so good at so fast and so strong and the world is going to respect us again believe me\nThis is probably his biggest failure\nBy the numbers by any objective standard the United states has plummeted in world opinion there are only a couple of countries in the entire world according to the Pew global attitudes survey which is the leading kind of non person independent survey of countries around the world and how they view the United states and other world leaders\nOnly in Russia Israel and possibly one or two other countries\nIs the standing of the United states

secretary of commerce you identify every violation of a foreign\nCountry his current news do harm to the American worker\nSo how has he done you've had the very tough and very consistent in some ways anti free trade anti globalization and specifically anti China views that Trump's a candidate Trump the president to put [noise]\nThat Susan Glasser again he pulled out of the TPP the Trans Pacific partnership which was the major regional trade deal negotiated in the course of the Obama administration that was meant to be the major American and its allies response to Chinese economic and increasingly security\nA muscle flexing in the region\nThere's been no clear strategy to replace that except to engage in that escalation on the economic front\nAnd here's Alex Lawson law three sixty senior reporter on international trade\nIt's definitely true to say that he has carefully gone about sort of restructuring America's trade deals and I say carefully only in the sense that\nWhile he would tell you that these are historical groundbreaking rewrites of past American trade deals most people will tell you that it's a little more ... and a little more nuanced than that\nSo let's get into that nuance\nRecently of course they has rewritten be North American free trade agreement and while it stops short of\nIlls of the old NAFTA that Trump's ran on doing on fixing\nIt is definitely an improvement in the sense of just people conduct business differently than they did in Nineteen Ninety four when it came into effect\nBut here's the thing to understand a lot of what they agreed to in the new NAFTA deal was already part of the Trans Pacific partnership agreement negotiated under President Obama that President Trump withdrew from\nCanada and Mexico we're in agreement that was considered Obama's NAFTA rewrite he also promised to rewrite NAFTA on the campaign trail in two thousand eight\nUm and that was waiting for Trump when he got there but instead of picking it up and asking Congress to pass it immediately withdrew the United states in the trade agreement he said it was terrible you never really gave specific on what he did it all white so it's a little disingenuous I think for him to say none of this happens without me and the way I impose these tariffs to apply pressure on them that's just not the case\nThe one thing that are two issues at the Trump Administration points to specifically the auto sector and on dairy and parrots or these brand new topics that the president was able to negotiate into this new NAFTA deal\nYou have touched on the issue at least that are the most difference now there was a lot of work done on improving dairy market access into Canada in GDP\nWe got a little bit more in this new NAFTA but it's by you know a couple of different decimal points but the automotive rules are very interesting um it Heather's tariffs benefits for cars to a minimum wage but at least sixteen dollars an hour and that is new that was not in the TPP\nTalk about terrorists early in the president's administration there was a lot of hand wringing especially from folks on Wall street some people within the president's administration saying we gotta stop all this Paris talk the economy when great the more we talk about parents the better chance that we\nSupport from Minnesota Public radio comes from ... H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learn more ed E. H. R. go dot com\nHe want for the U.S on trade\nWhile you're correct that the economy is still very robust and growing\nBut I Would say and many economists will tell you that the strength of the U.S economy is what is shielding the president from the adverse effects of terrorists not it's growing because of terrorists and as far as what he was hoping to achieve it seems entirely political to me at this point we began by talking about what he campaigned on and talk trade enforcement in the form of terrorists was part of that\nYou know I Will counter unfair trade practices by several partners namely China but it's it's manifested in other partners as well and that's what's happened\nBut it's not really forcing anyone to the negotiating table you know he claims that NAFTA doesn't happen without tariffs but as I just laid out these are two of our closest allies they will always sit down and talk with us\nAnd asked us now basically what you're seeing is a terrorist beginning to take root and the most rapid escalation has been with China that the terrorists know coverage hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of Chinese goods and those are beginning to recover consumer goods the last round of tariffs started to cover ... computers furniture or things like that\nConventional economic theory tells you that you're going to start to see prices raised on that and even though he can go out on the campaign trail and say you see I impose these tariffs 'cause I'm at work for you the forward thinking you know voter will say okay yes you did that but\nWhat does it actually do for us that sort of where we're at on terrorists here it's true that he's impose them and through that he kept to his word on that but on a broader scale I don't know that there's anything they can point to in say the terrorists got you acts you know there's really no they're they're\nThe other thing the president talked a lot of that as a candidate was the ...\nOur job wise has there been a significant change in the trade deficit since he's been president\nYou had a significant changes that it has actually gone up quite a bit since he's come into office it's been an interesting tight rope for critics to walk because while he said I'm working on reducing a trade deficit um it continues to climb\nBut at the same time critics also said when he made those arguments the trade deficit\nIf it's high isn't really like necessarily a bad thing for our economy in many contexts it can be the mark of the very healthy economy because consumers are embolden to buy things the Trump Administration and President Trump himself continues to frame this as sort of a\nLike a bank account right it's just like look at us losing all this money you either not understanding or willfully distorting the fact that it's actually just private companies and citizens who wants to buy things with their money it's not like we're flushing money down the drain we have great purchasing power in this country and we're using it\nAnd the other thing the president talked a lot about as a candidate and he still does today which is to say listen I'm a free trader I'm not anti free trade I'm just fair trade if you had to grade this president on a free trade scale where would you put him\nI mean it's it's in the ... range I don't understand how anybody could look at two years of like rapidly and largely unprecedented since the Nineteen thirties largely unprecedented escalation of of terrorists both with allies and with countries were more contentious within say\nThis is a free trade president I think that's such a foolish state to state with a straight face that you're a free trader\nTo such a fast start for for a variety of reasons I think on the one hand the Republican and the federalist society machine to put judges to nominate judges and put them on a Supreme Court is an incredibly well oiled won this was something that really jumped out at me actually when I was reading that Brett Kavanaugh's emails was\nThe process within the White House counsel's office to identify possible vacancies and and think about who's going to do that that I just don't think democratic administrations do in the same way so it's a well oiled machine\nThere weren't vacancies when he took office in no small part because the Republican Senate had slowed down the process of confirming President Obama's nominees and so I don't have that exact up to date statistics but as of September\nHe had already put twenty six judges on the federal courts of appeals President Obama to give you a point of comparison put fifty five on the courts of appeals in his eight years\nIs going to change the makeup of the federal courts swing them significantly to the right in in a way that's going to have a lasting impact for for decades\nAmy thank you for joining us thanks for having me on any how is the co founder of scotusblog [noise]\nProgramming on Minnesota Public radio supported by the law

other day\nWas the first thing you're going to [noise] well we're working really on repealing Obamacare [noise]\nThe campaign President Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable CARE Act otherwise known as Obamacare Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news host of the what the health podcast\nWell the administration has done quite a bit actually so did Congress the big thing that Congress did was in the tax bill after they were unable to pass their repeal and replace legislation they eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance the individual mandate penalty\nThe president also cut off federal funding also for a controversial or at least a contested\nPart of the law that gave special discounts to lower income people people with incomes below two and a half times poverty although in the end the insurance industry was able to find a workaround for that ended up giving not only those people discounts but some other people discounts to\nThe other big thing the administration has done is it allowed\nDifferent kinds of insurance plans with basically lesser benefits than are required under Obamacare um they're called short term planting some that are called association health plans\nAnd the concern is that healthier people will move into these kinds of plant because they're cheaper but the problem is they don't offer very much and sometimes it's not entirely clear what they don't offer until you discovered that you need something so those are sort of the big things that have happened to the law in the last year um\nPresident likes to say the law is dead and then the next breath like say but we fixed it and he also talked a lot\nAs a candidate saying that the health care premiums are going up one point he said they're going up to forty fifty fifty five percent they're still talk from the White House and Republicans that premiums are still skyrocketing what do we know about premiums on the exchanges at this point\nActually very interestingly premiums next year for twenty Nineteen are going to go down slightly about one and a half percent the average premium in the states that are run by the the federal government which is most of them what analysts say is that they would have gone down considerably more if not for some of the changes that the administered\nProgramming is supported by Mira a new kind of precision pain

voters said they disapprove of the law now here we are two years later and the majority not significant but a smaller majority said that they support the Affordable CARE Act so ... how do you explain that\nA I feel like twenty Seventeen in the fight over repealing the law was basically the the marketing plan that the Obama administration never had for the law it taught people what was in it I'm basically a top people what was in it by suggesting what they were going to lose\nA particularly things like protections for pre existing conditions expansions of Medicaid that it helped a lot of middle class people not just poor people do little class people who are you know uh being expect to take care of their aging parents um\nTheir Medicaid has proved to be much more popular than I think Republicans realized um so it was it goes to much more than the laws much larger than just a five percent of people who are in these individual markets buying insurance\nAnd I think people actually learned just as it was getting ready to go away that maybe these are things we actually would like to keep around [noise] so what happens\nIn twenty Nineteen the Republicans have said if we keep control of Congress we're going to go at it again we're going to take another repeal vote\nYou have Democrats many of them are running this year on something they call Medicare for all saying that they are going to make that a priority should they take control of Congress should really can you help us understand what could really possibly happen in twenty Nineteen\nInteresting that it's sort of the health debate is by for ... you know where's the Affordable CARE Act was ...\nRoad moderate plan market basic it attracts some\nModerate Republicans which in the end they didn't but that was that was the idea now we're seeing sort of both sides going to their corners Republicans saying you know yes we want to get rid of this whole thing and start over with what we don't know Democrats are saying\nYeah maybe this compromise thing didn't work we want to have Medicare for all single payer universal coverage\nCall it what you will but because I think people are frustrated with the state of the healthcare system right now\nEven if premiums are moderating out of pocket expenses are going up people are paying more or they perceive that they are paying more health care is simply too expensive\nAnd they're thinking that yes the Affordable CARE Act was a nice thing but people are still hurting and we need to do something more dramatic so you know what you end up with and are are are these sort of polar opposites and it's hard to see where there could be any middle ground where something could pass at least in the immediate future\nThe discussion about Medicare for all has been very active on the Democratic side the president himself took to USA Today he penned in an op ed where he argued that this proposal of Medicare for all is going to\nTotally destroy Medicare as we know it for seniors and that it's basically a form of socialism what do we know about the president's plans\nFor Medicare uh especially since we know that this is a big driver of government spending and there seems to be discussion\nEvery year about its potential bankrupting the country or running out of money so where does he seemed to be going with discussions on this\n... I'm actually surprised that this didn't come up until now Medicare has been a a a traditional issues or Medicare scare tactics have been traditionally issue for Republicans in midterms um because older people tend to vote\nIt goes back to twenty ten when the Republicans were trying to undermine the Affordable CARE Act they were not so much arguing about the the parts of the law that we think of as Obamacare\nThey were arguing about all the money that the Affordable CARE Act cut out of Medicare um ironically in the interim the Republicans when they got into office um said and yeah those Medicare cuts that were in the Affordable CARE Act which were mostly cuts to provider payment for beneficiaries actually got more benefits out of that law\nBut there were reduction in payments to hospitals and doctors and\nFor a variety of other things and the Republicans decided that they were going to keep those cuts because they made sense and because they needed the money uh interestingly a President Trump's own budget recommends more cuts to Medicare again mostly to provider payments um but for the president it to then go out and bashed the Democrats for having\nCut Medicare and the Affordable CARE Act yeah that that doesn't really work for the Republicans now the argument that Medicare for all will undermine Medicare is a relatively new and this seems to be the favorite Republican line of attack it's like\nThey will not only make America you know a socialist program they will get rid of Medicare for seniors to um at least on your most of the Medicare for all bills we've seen seniors we get more benefits and have to pay less\nHow the country could afford it is a debate that needs to be had\nBut it's a little bit of an of an odd scare tactic to say that that seniors would lose Medicare if the country went to Medicare for everybody\nTo wrap their thanks for joining us my pleasure\nAnd thank you for joining us here during the noon hour MPR news presents the takeaway friday with Amy Walter back in less than two minutes but we have to do some important business Steven John alone with mercury to foreign op reminding you that the fall member drive is a great opportunity\nFor you to step up and say yes I appreciate what you do I want to help pay for it you can do that by calling one eight hundred to two seven twenty eight eleven or online\nAnd you can join the ranks of people like Michelle from Minneapolis ... markets from Plymouth, Minnesota they all just became members to Minnesota Public radio thinking that so so much", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "city": "Rochester", "day": "12"}
