E. L. I. M. he has held yeah gotta yes\nUm so I think that that's a a ... here's the other thing that I think is um again another difficult conversation to have with your kids\nThink about what the what the horizon looks like so when I I have a degree in English um from Marquette University and\nSo my really an English major yeah British literature a minor in theology wow what a and you ended up in the financial services feel it's\nA it's a it's a a trajectory that makes a ton of sense if you know\nOh it is you know if you're borrowing money and I did my my perspective and this is how I ended up in finance that when I started when I was twenty and I knew I was going to borrow about twenty thousand dollars to graduate\nThat was my cat because I knew that when I graduated I couldn't reasonably expect to make more money than that\nBased on the skills in the background that I had so I was very reluctant to take on any more debt and what I thought I could earn my first year and that's really smart and I think it I I think that's something to have a conversation with our kids about\nHow does how does that conversation sound you're going to be a teacher right we can figure out what you're probably gonna make so let's get off at thirty thirty five\nThousand maximum but more importantly than let's back up that conversation and say\nLet's let's look at let's look at the marriage and not the wedding so if the career path is education\nWhat do you need to do in order to make that happen so do you actually need a four year degree from a elite private college or you know would you be well advised to look at men Kato state or some of them more economical and exceptional educational institutions that we have here\nI'm In Minnesota so those are the kinds of conversations if you want to be a poet find out what the barista\nAt Starbucks is making because that's going to give you some ballpark of what might be prudent in terms of the amount of money that you're going to borrow or you go ahead oh and I was going to say and the less you borrow them more freedom you have right so you could move\nAnywhere take the kind of jobs around one because you don't have this big huge cloud of debt hanging over you and it's not about being\nWith your kids but it's really about saying you know what is that long term look like for you and and how can we not burden\nAmount of debt and then you can spend your evenings talking about how great the Broncos are exec because you know because you don't you're not [laughter] about how much you owe and that's great to six five one to two seven six thousand for your questions about\nThe FAFSA application five twenty nine investing in saving for college eight hundred two for two twenty eight twenty eight wherever you are in our five state region and then on Twitter at carry NPR to the phones to Katie in mendota Hi tai Katie\nHi Carey I have a couple of things to say I want to reiterate that actually PF deal in Minnesota is in tenth grade ... college okay good on current technical\nThings um I also wanted to reiterate that Minnesota is a state that has a state grant that a ... a CIA answering the questions\n[noise] uh I actually were for higher education institutions uh-huh\nI'm In I'm In government relations and very passionate about this this topic mhm I Would say on the five twenty nine and Minnesota actually recently became um I don't want to miss used word deduction or credit but any\nOne who could chew a child's five twenty nine can get some sort of tax benefit from it mhm and so I encourage everyone my parents my family we asked for a book and made a contribution and my kids are\nFor or the four year old girls excellent and I would just encourage all of you to do that and I also want to just reiterate that\nUm\nHigh higher education does pay off its just how you do it\nYeah we're not here to say don't do college 'cause it's expensive here just smell it wouldn't why I no\nNo that's not the state the be be very specific as ... as your guest just last Saturday\nSo I Know your kid wants to do and help them plan right part and and it will pay are then and my dad had he he has a master of three sisters one have mastered the bachelor and Manhattan is a bachelor's degree we've done really well with him\nMy husband has a high school degree to the pilot and make a year's here so\nYou can make would you remind you will love on Thanksgiving [laughter] he reminds me every day [laughter]\nKatie thank you know it's it's good insight on this I'm clear asks on Twitter John\nMy husband and I were just talking about our daughter's five twenty nine plan thanks for the time like show any suggestions if we should pool all college savings to her five twenty nine or should we mix it with other saving options\nWell the five twenty nine is is great because it allows you to do a tax advantaged savings plan in most five twenty nine plans are offered by every state you don't have to invade vested in your state's plan but they have this automatic options so it's it's set to your\nChild's age so early on there are there more in stocks and then when they get closer to a team uh they they make it a lot less market risky so they do that automatic allocation for you in it and it's really a good deal\nI'm you know it it just keep in mind ever flexibility with any five twenty nine plan if your kid doesn't go to school you could use it for graduate\nUm you know school yourself you can use it for another child you could you know change the beneficiary they're usually really flexible\nOr in most states uh allow you the option to do it or it's just important to keep in mind that you know the earlier the save you save and the more often you're you're able to save the the more you\nQuestion was five twenty nine and more or I mean can you put the most of what you're saving into a five twenty nine what what do you think\nI Would because the option of project from Texas okay anything you pull out of it is not just if it's used for education college tuition room and board computers okay\nSo it's it's really the best vehicle for that other options you're going to get attached to her you know you can't put it in retirement funds to do it on it it\nDarling you seemed a little little more skeptical of everything going into the five twenty nine why\nA couple of reasons one is um\nThe flexibility that you have of non retirement or a non uh educational money separate from what's in the five twenty nine I think gives families a lot more choices I'm so I'm always reluctant and I'm In a in a most people don't have the advantage of quote over funding there five twenty nine and um\nSo that's one aspect of it the other the other thing is that\nThe five to eighty nine as a hundred percent available for tuition versus your separate personal wealth which is treated a little bit differently once once you're applying for aid so\nUm [noise] you know so I think it's I think it's good you know I typically you know with with ah families that have the option to get there my goal is to get at least half way to what we think school is going to cost\n'em through the five twenty five twenty nine and then the balance of it allocated differently\nDarla cash in with us if he's just tuned in to hear this discussion about how to pay for college through five twenty nine and ... a a application she's a senior vice president of financial advisor at our BC wealth management and John ... with us the author of the debt free degree how do we eliminate college debt at ...\nMike thanks so much for waiting below the body I have a question much shipped to question how can one is how the ... nine of financial aid and if I have three kids and they all have individual\nFive twenty nine than they can move money between them what should I be putting all the money in my youngest one five twenty nine so the oldest gets more financial aid\nAnd okay hang on

seep in Minnesota law firms in Nineteen Seventy four helping individuals and families whose lives have been devastated by accidents resulting injury or death more enjoyable dot com [noise]\nBack to the discussion now in to the phones to release a in St Paul Hi Lisa thanks so much for waiting\nThank you uh I wanted to go back to the FAFSA miniature um you can\nGet estimates of your financial aid on line before you actually filed the FAFSA so for example if you have money in the bank theoretically that's going to lower your financial aid you can look at the effect of paying down your credit card debt\nThat takes money out of your bank it pays off your debt it might make you eligible for more financial aid okay\nDown your mortgage putting money into retirement all those things help take care of the parents and might make the children eligible for more financial aid and you can you can get those estimates before you even submit that saps the filing so it's a it's a nice tool to be able to you\nThat's that's really good advice John I I hear leases saying really dig it\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

hundreds of organizations around the country are asking Americans to envision that kind of possibility is part of the fourth annual imagine that day without water\nTo mark the day we're bringing you a discussion looking at threats to and conflicts over the world's fresh water supplies the program was part of the twenty Eighteen Nobel Peace prize forum hosted by Oxford University this fall\nTo start is out here is water expert and MacArthur Award recipient Peter click\nLive on a water planet or as the writer science fiction writer and other writer Arthur C clerk noted I if we didn't happen to live on land\nWe wouldn't call this place on earth we would call it ocean ah the the planet is covered with water two thirds are more on the surface of the planet is\nOcean ah and of course for humans freshwater is critical for life or our economic well being for\nThe health of natural ecosystems for our economy's offer everything we really care about\nMuch of the water on the planet has salt water it's too salty to drink it's whose fault it used to grow the food that we eat a it's too salty to use in our day to day lives on Ninety seven percent of the water on the planet as salt water\nIn the oceans and so when we talk about water for humans we're really talking about\nWhat's left that three percent\nA and the reality of courses that three percent isn't really available to us mostly a as well the vast majority of the world's freshwater is locked up in the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland I in glaciers on land or in deep groundwater that's not access\nIn our rivers and our lakes and a little bit and soil moisture in what falls is rain that we capture immediately is a tiny tiny fraction of the world's water\nAnd that's what we depend upon\n\nThere is a water crisis a there is a global climate crisis and those things are connected I I'd like to also argue that there is a growing epidemic of violence orange conflict around the world associated with water\nAnd what I'd like to do is I'd like to connect the dots between water and a little bit about climate I'm not going to talk that much about climate except in the context of water and armed conflict and violence and talk about where those three issues intersect\nA and more importantly how we might move to split on my part how we might move to a lemonade or at least reduce the risk of conflicts over water but before I Do that let me digress a little bit uh I'm a climatologist than a hydrologist by training on a scientist\nI work at the intersection of science and policy in my Institute is that a nonprofit research Institute works at that intersection\nFactor yet it's indisputable that fresh water has been in the past and continues to be\nA trigger or a weapon or a casualty of conflict trigger weapon in casualty those are the categories that we use\nFlicks over water and I'll come back to that so we maintain this open source database or they're over five hundred and fifty examples already and it's a and the risk of conflicts the experience of violence over water is growing overtime and you can see that\nIt includes examples from every region of the world except Antarctica at the moment for maybe obvious reasons I'm an disturbingly we're seeing those examples increase over time\nEspecially in the last decade and the increasing is correlated with water scarce areas of the world\nWhere we have rising populations and growing demands on water a growing economies that compete for fix often limited amounts of water\nThe vast majority of the cases are not nation to nation conflicts\nIt's not one country fighting with another country\nItself national conflicts it's individuals disputing and ... and ... and fighting over access to water is non governmental militias it's civil conflicts rather than what we tend to think about in the international community as state to state disputes\nAnd part of a challenge to the vet poses is that it is at the state level than at the national level\nWe have pretty well developed tools for addressing conflicts nations don't like to go to war there's a cost to going to war we have the international agreements over a river basins that are shared by nations\nOften not always but often we have international law the United nations that sets standards for how you deal with sharing water resources and many of those resources available at the national level are not available or not\nSupport from Minnesota Public radio comes from the ... H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology in healthcare learned more ed E. H. R. go dot com\nFrom accessing safe water or water resources in water systems as weapons of conflict conflicts that may start for some other reason but\nWhere water is a weapon or water systems are weapons and water as a casualty or target of conflict where water systems are attacked again during conflicts that may start for some other reason entirely so let me give you a few historical examples\nAnd I'll go way back so those are you like history go look at the chronology uh there's some really sort of remarkable stories there but one of the very first entries in the database is around twenty four hundred and fifty BC\nTwenty four hundred and fifty BC forty five hundred years ago we have the first written evidence of a direct conflict\nOver water resources when the king of a community in ancient Mesopotamia the king of leg off diverting water from an irrigation canal against the neighboring city ...\nIn the region between the Tigris and Euphrates River\nIn ancient Mesopotamia use water as a weapon in a conflict with this neighbor between seven hundred and four hundred BC there are numerous accounts from Egypt and from Persia and from Babylon\nAnd from Syria the diversion of water away from a city as a weapon or using water as a tool of the war in the region in Ninety a de Joseph is wrote about the diversion of a stream to Jerusalem fifty years early\nPro curator a pompous pilot and the deadly attack on by Roman soldiers on people who\nWere protesting this diversion of water away from their community in one of the first examples of water as a trigger of conflict\nOr disputes over access to water violence over water rights in the western United States and the Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds were fairly common between farmers and ranchers\nUh between Nineteen oh seven and Nineteen Thirteen Los Angeles valley aqueduct pipeline was bombed many times by\nFarmers who are protesting the diversion of water from the ... valley and the eastern part of California down to Los Angeles and if you've seen the movie Chinatown some of that and violence is associated with that issue but watch young damn in Korea\nOf opposing forces during the Korean War in Nineteen fifty one North Korea opens the damn to flood downstream areas to prevent the advance of allied forces and un forces and in response to the un navy the U.S navy sent bombers to attack the dam\nAnd the Nineteen nineties Saddam Hussein poisoned and drained of the water supplies of the marshes at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates River ah ah to punish the southern Shiite marsh Arabs that were opposing his regime\nIn Baghdad\nThe recent violence in both Syria and Iraq all of the dams on the Tigris and Euphrates River and there are many of them now has been the target\nOf the conflict Islamic state captured many of those dams in early part of the conflict ah ah Iraqi and us and allied forces recaptured many of those dams those dams were used as targets they were used as weapons of war\nCommunities are there many examples from that conflict and most recently in Yemen\nWe have seen what appears to be the intentional targeting of civilian water systems water treatment plants water distribution plants are destroying access to safe water and sanitation for millions of Yemeni eye and contributing to a massive\nOutbreak of cholera in Yemen there have been over a million cases of cholera in the last few years and over two thousand deaths because of the destruction of the\nA civilian water system there and there are many many other\nExamples\n[noise] okay that's the end of the deficit model part of the talk\nUm but part of the reason the deficit model tells only part of the story or is this fear that accepting bad information paying attention to bad news just leads to despair and depression and denial and it makes us think\nOkay I'm going to go home and put my head under the pillow um and that phenomenon is also well understood and it's true that the background for these issues can be depressing so let me take a different approach for the last part of my talk\nLet me assumed that whether or not you believe there's a water crisis and I'm sure you all do\nOr whether or not you accept the science that says the climate change is a challenge and it's going to be an increasing challenge in coming years whether or not you really think there's a strong link between resources in security questions you'll still want to know that they were smart\nAnd effective and innovative things that can be done to address these challenges things that I call\nAnd so let me talk about fixing water\nThe conflicts over water reducing the risk of violence associated with water owners requires that we understand why water is a trigger or a casualty or a weapon of conflict and then you work to reduce those factors\nWhere water is a trigger of conflict the principal factors are water scarcity and control over water resources lack of access one populations are deprived of access to safe water and sanitation people care that's if that's as fundamental as it gets\nAnd self control of water and availability of safe water and sanitation and water services is critical\nAnd while there's no single solution to that challenge there are a lot of things that can\nAnd I would argue are being done things that we do without regret that makes sense no matter what they can make our water problems better and so let me describe some of these no regrets strategies the things that no matter what you\nBelieve we might want to do anyway and I'll show this one cartoon for those if you hadn't seen it\nIt says\nSomebody's giving a talk somebody looks a little like me\nI'm Talking about positive no regrets things that we might want to do when somebody saying well what if it's a big hoax than we create a better world for nothing so that's the point\nThese are no regrets strategies these are things that makes sense to do any way\nThe numbers of black women are running for office but is the Democratic party ready to support\nI go to the DNC when I notice systemic issues as far as opportunities for black women the DNC and getting black women a seat at the table that next time on the take away from WNYC NPR I\nIt's coming up about twenty minutes from El at one o'clock you're on Minnesota Public radio new [noise]\nThis is NPR News presents no back to the twenty Eighteen Nobel Peace prize for him the presentation called the world's fresh water from conflict to peace keep Roman used the lead scientist for the global water initiative at the University of Minnesota She spoke after water expert Peter Gleick and then\nThe two of them responded to audience questions I Hope all of you enjoyed\nPeters talk as much as I did I think that was fantastic so thank you very much [noise] I was asked to to respond and I feel like I have so much to say but I also promised to keep this to five minutes\nUm\nOne thing that Peter's talk really got me thinking about and I wonder if it got you thinking about as well is this idea of water shortage and what is it so if we only have access to\nOne percent less of less than one percent of the water on the planet is that just a little bit of water or is that a lot of water\nAnd I actually think it's a lot of water I spend a lot of time playing with the outputs of giant global models of the hydra logic system and the unit that we use when we talk about water and those models as cubic kilometers that's a lot of swimming pools [noise]\nAnd so when I think about water I also come back to something else that Peter said which is that it's not distributed evenly across the planet\nEvenly distributed the available water is not the same everywhere and the way we use of water isn't the same everywhere\nAnd it's that mismatch where we start getting into trouble so if we think about water scarcity what is water scarcity\nIt's not just the deserts there are lots of places that struggle with water scarcity that don't look like the ... or even the southwest of the United states some of them look like Minnesota\nAnd that's because I Would argue that really what the definition of water scarcity is is not having the water available to do what we want with it\nSo what do we want to do with water well a lot of times we want to do with water what we've always done with water and some of that really is about water you're never going to get away with drinking anything except water\nI mean you might drink beer you might drink wine you might even drink OJ but at the end of the day you're drinking water\nAnd if you want to go fishing you need water to provide a habitat for the fish to be able to go out and enjoy the stream and we're here in Dakota homeland where ... the source of the world is really just down the Mississippi River from where we are in those things water is central\nBut if you actually look at most of the things we do with water water is an input but it's not the point so if you want to get rid of your waist you probably flush it down the toilet or maybe you flushed down the sink\nBut there are other things we could be doing we have built systems that make that an easy thing to do and ineffective thing to do and it makes sense that we do it but it's not the only way we could deal with getting rid of our waste another thing we\nCrops so I was lucky enough to get to be part of a session that was part of the Nobel Peace prize forum on Thursday about imagining the new green revolution\nAnd one of the things we did with have a a fun but somewhat contentious conversation about what our shared values were\nAnd what what do we want to see agriculture and the food system producing so we talked about food about nourishment and we talked about abundance and we talked about good quality of life um and livelihoods for farmers and people who work on the land we did not talk about water\nBecause you need water to grow crops but it's not the end game of why we're farming and if we think about not just farming more efficiently but farming differently\nMaybe there are different ways for us to think about managing water so instead of trying to reach shuffle a pie that's only so big we actually think about changing what the endgame of the pie is so that\nIf we have stores of food during wet years then sometimes during dry years we let our fields go fallow and we make sure that those farmers get paid and that their livelihoods are protected\nWe make sure that people don't go hungry but we also recognize that during certain times there's not enough water to irrigate a field and that's OK\nThat we create flexibility in our systems\nSo all close with thinking about this as something that I Know here in Minnesota we struggle with but I think we're struggling with all around the country and really all around the world and that's questions about infrastructure\nSo here in Minnesota we're facing a really big challenge of needing to replace and fix an awful lot of our water infrastructure so that we don't see something like Flint happening here in Minnesota or elsewhere in the country\nSafe and they're moving clean water around\nWhat if instead of looking at that as a challenge we looked at as an opportunity as a way to re imagine our water system so that we use water differently\nInstead of just building up what we already have and thought about all the different things we could potentially do with water so recycling wastewater\nKind of hard to do in the system we have now but we could build a system where that was part of every house in every business\nThere's a million opportunities out there and I'm thrilled to see so many people from so many places in so many ages in the audience and excited to think about what we might be able to make as we move into the future and creating water piece out of a paradox we have no [noise]\n\nWe're going to say a few questions at a much sun well\nOne thing that I haven't heard discussed in any substantial way is population growth it hit\nMe between the eyes of the other day I was Peace Corps volunteer in Ecuador in\nThe early seventies and I was talking to somebody who is there today in their current population is sixteen and a half million [noise] and from three million to sixteen and a half million and they're still growing\nAnd this is a country that doesn't have the lowest birth doesn't have the highest birth rate in Latin America much less and that's a tremendous growth [laughter] we\nAre people and we\nAre growing exponentially\nHence the roads in the need for a while\nFor every purpose that we're doing and I haven't heard this discussion about population growth as being part of the council\nVotes so oh great question so on population um let me say a couple of things are first of all I agree completely in general we are not having a sufficient conversation about population or anywhere and so it's a\nI Would love to see a whole conference devoted to it\nI'm\nFrom a water perspective I have sort of mixed feelings without a doubt on growing population of it is a is bad for fix resource we have a fixed amount of water on the climate and the more people you have a less water per person who's available\nOn the other hand it's vital that we need basic human needs for water and sanitation for everyone on the planet\nIt's harder with more people than fewer people but but we have to meet those basic needs independent of the population issue so I Would argue yes what's address the population a few but but we still have to deal with the people that are here\nI agree with that entirely and I also want to emphasize that\nParallel to the climate question answer the food question if you look at the\nImpact or the footprint of an individual with water like with climate and with food in developed countries are impact is much much bigger so as individuals we demand a tremendous\nAmount more water than in parts of the developing world and so obviously\nThere are some parts of the developing world where we would like to see people get more water [noise] but\nIf what if we're going to be really honest about the impact we're having it's not about population and a spouse\nHere's your NPR Twin Cities forecast kind of a dismal day to day widespread drizzle clouds fog

be with you can you remind our listeners who could show he is and why he was being targeted by the Saudi Government\nSo he was one of the most outspoken critics but the most interesting thing for a

way\nAnd then lately she'd taken up a poster with the Washington Post or the global columnist and moved away from Saudi Arabia and basically set up and self imposed exile\nIn his in his criticism had

here\nWe've been following this day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the that the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and\nThey talked early on of
