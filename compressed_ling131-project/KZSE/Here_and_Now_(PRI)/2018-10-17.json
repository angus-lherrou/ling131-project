in Minnesota yesterday to speak to thousands of people at the University of Minnesota\nNorth rip auditorium it was the annual Stein lecture which has previously featured Supreme Court justices Sandra Day O'Connor Sonia Sotomayor and the late Antonin Scalia most of the time was spent in a wide ranging conversation with former law school dean and now professor Robert Stein\nChief justice Roberts defended the independence of the federal judiciary in the wake of a tense confirmation battle for the Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nConfirmations submitted a conservative majority [noise]\nThank you very much thank you [noise]\nBefore I sit down with professor ... Stein for the main event\nUm I thought I Would spend a moment or two touching upon the contentious events in Washington of recent weeks I Will not criticized the political branches\nWe do that often enough in our opinions\nWhat I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is how it must be very different\nRespect for our public officials\nAfter all they speak for the people\nAnd that commands a certain degree of humility from those in the ... of us in the judicial branch\nWho do not we do not speak for the people\nBut we speak for the constitution our role is very clear we are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United states\nAnd ensure that the political branches act\nThat job obviously requires\nIndependence from the political branches\nThe story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence\nWithout independence there is no brown versus board of education without independence there is no West Virginia versus Barnett\nWhere the court held that the government could not compel schoolchildren to salute the flag\nAnd without independence there is no steel seizure case\nBut if there's some area which we can come to agreement you know sometimes perhaps perhaps in significant issue but one that has to be resolved will do that just so the the the case continues rather than being sent back without any Reza resolution at all\nThe court is now back to nine justices as a result of justice Kavanaugh's confirmation as a new member of the court I succeeding Justice Kennedy can you describe how the court

well conducted a usually people are jumping on each other's questions but nobody was doing that\nBut it also I think causes the rest of us to sort of take a harder look at some things that we might have taken for granted you know for Thirteen Years I've been explaining my view of a particular clause to my colleagues they know what they know what I think um and now you get somebody new and you're kind of have to explain it a little more\nThoroughly because he or she hasn't heard it yet and it causes you to take another look at it so I I I think there's a lot of I wouldn't go so far as the say re examination but they they knew articulation of a particular view and that that may cause others to look at it a little more carefully\nBefore we move on and off the subject or I I Would like to ask you to comment about the departure of a Justice Kennedy from the court who served the court so long and it was the senior member of the court at the time he retired\nUm he was an extraordinarily

[noise] so I really recommend people to get a real sense of his the understanding of the constitution and liberty and the scope of his learning to get a whole list I don't know when the law review is going to have it out but you can I'm sure you can get it on line\nIt would be it's a remarkable reading list or to give you an insight not only into liberty and under our constitution but a remarkably well read very decent individual I'm going to miss in\nA while he had a big impact on\nMany of us when he he heard I was going to teach a course in great cases are at the law school as I left the ADA he said let me see that list what they're getting out and uh\nHe insisted that a couple of cases be added to that list in his opinion many of the people in the public don't know very much about the Supreme Court or I recall surveys when I was at the American bar association finding that as many as Fifteen Percent of the public couldn't name a single justice on the Supreme Court\nAnd Annenberg center found that a study found that ten percent of those surveyed\nIdentify judge Judy as a\nJustice on the Supreme Court [noise]\nIt's just lack of knowledge about the\nCourt a problem in your opinion yes and no I'm the lack of knowledge about how the Supreme Court functions\nAnd in particular how it is different from the political branches is very unfortunate I think too many people think that when we we\nFace it's pretty much the same as a Congress reaching a decision on a question of policy and of course it's not that at all it's very different and people need to know that\nUm but I'm not bothered by the fact that they can't name people ... and in some sense I think that's probably a very good thing\nWe were black robes to convey the notion that our individual views personality or does not have anything to do with the function we have to play in terms of coming to correct decision on the law\nSo I don't feel any need to have people know\nThe individuals how who are performing to work for the court but they do need to know how to work with the court is different from that of other entities and the government are there are times when you move in public when you are not recognized by\nOh sure I generally am not um and uh and interestingly when I Am I Would say almost Ninety nine percent of the time to people who come up\nTo me are are very nice they either say something you know how much they liked what I Do and even the ones I don't keep track of how many but who don't agree with me they'll come up and say they appreciate my service but they don't agree\nAnd sometimes they'll be very few of in in praise of foreign opinion of the court and say how great the court was when it did this and how important it was an ... please they are and I just don't have the heart to tell them I was in dissent [laughter]\nYou think that allowing cameras in the court would be helpful in the work of the court are getting more people familiar with how the court operates I think it'd be very helpful in getting more people familiar with how the court operates\nBut that's not our job to educate people our job is to carry out our role under the constitution to interpret the constitution and laws um according to the rule of law and I think that\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoors

I published lyrics I'm more of a texture list\nWell I didn't hear from Bob Dylan about a year and that's yeah well maybe a well\nOne of the connections I wanted to ask you about a back in the sixties Bob Dylan sang a at a place the scholar and dinky town just blocks from where we are right now and are under his given name Bobby Zimmerman so uh some of us who were here on campus at that time had a chance to hear him then\nThe last time I saw was in Washington at wolf trap a and I took my kids who are Seventeen and Eighteen I'm just a few years ago\nNow and um he sang his latest album which was a collection of like Perry Cuomo and Sinatra songs and um\nAnd to be candid I didn't understand what it was all about [noise]\nOne of the comments you made when you became chief justice is that you hope to achieve greater consensus on the court you hope there would be more nine to zero uh decisions eight to one seven to two rather than five to four [noise] do you feel in a Thirteen Years now that you've been chief justice that that\nConsensus says developed in if it has is that due to deciding cases more narrowly so you can bring more justice was on board well\nI'm I have to say it's a project in progress are still some years it's it's that we've had a bigger number and other years not and has more to do I think with the nature of the cases than than anything else\nUm I still think it's an important objective um one because I think judicial decisions should be narrow or rather than broader\nAnd the way to do that is to try to get as many people on board as you can that I'm a you know if you're going to reach a broad decision that's going to cover all sorts of different a factual scenarios a lot of people are going to say well well I'm not quite sure I agree with that\nUh and then they might write something narrower but if you keep it narrow that it only has decides what's absolutely necessary to be decided usually you can get more people\nTo agree with that one of our most important decisions brown versus board of education is a perfect example of that ah Earl Warren work extremely hard to get everybody on board because he wanted to be unanimous decision\nTo send a clear message to the American people that were turning a page a as a matter of a law\nAnd he was able to do that and I don't have a lot of lawyers and even judges don't appreciate this but the opinion in brown versus board of education was I I think eleven pages long and warned said you know if he'd written one more paragraph people were going to start\nYou pay a price for that and you did and brown as well which you have a lot of issues in the area that aren't resolved and and need to be you know spend in many cases a generation dissolving but worn thought it was more important to keep everybody together and as a result wrote an opinion while\nRevolutionary was in its own terms really narrow would us versus Nixon be another example of that when I yeah I think so and you know and it's true even in little minor ... tax cases I'm\nThere again I think courts sometimes get in trouble when they try to sweep more broadly than necessary and trying to get as many people on board forces you to have a narrower opinion\nDo you think the media tends to focus too much on sharply divided five to four decisions\nWell I I mean they've got their own audience to worry about so I'm sure they focus on you know what's important uh to them um it it's not that they focus too much on five to four\nDecisions and and I don't mean to be critical of our press forward in fact I'm you know I can be cruel Majid Lee I Wish I could be critical them but they're very very good at a ... and this partly because they are a dedicated\nCore and we're fortunate in terms of having the public understand what we do that we have people there who know how to read Supreme Court opinions and and uh all that but\nI'm ah in some instances with other reporters\nYou'll have a decision that sharply divided five to for the first thing will tell you what it was sharply divided five to four\nThen they'll have an interview with somebody from an environmental case will have an interview from somebody from industry or somebody from the Sierra Club in each one of the sides think it's a horrible disaster or the other a great victory and then you'd have other commentary that\nSupport for NPR's brought

you didn't find out more at ... dot com and\nLet's see I I can see I can see what the problem was they don't know if that means this or that\nBut instead it has to be portrayed more in a you know a political way that I suppose somebody must think uh is is more more readily understandable but from the court's perspective I Would just like to see the one sentence that caused people to split\nSo that people could reasonable people again one of my sisters could look at that and see I see why are there are two sides to that story\nWe've talked before in this series about the ... on the court and heard that uh there is great ... even those passions about the cases\nCause deep divisions in our country can you talk a little bit about the ... is on the court is you see it right now\nAnd uh whether you take any steps to foster that ...\nUm [noise] I think the ... on the court is very very good um uh we do think we are in this important enterprise together\nUm there's some ways in in which the nine of us are\nSurprisingly similar in terms of you know\nWhat what we come from two different law schools and all sorts of things that really are surprised um [noise]\nOther ways in which we're very different um and I'm a uh the ... very good um uh we spent in in many ways it's it's unlike any other job there aren't many jobs where everybody is doing exactly the same thing I mean if you're at a company and you're in sales you're all in sales but you're selling to different people\nDo exactly the same thing we read the same briefs we go to the same arguments we read the same cases I'm a and that does cause a real bond to develop\nA between you and also because of obvious reasons were often the only people we can talk to about certain subjects I'm because I'm a\nYou know you don't want to talk about a lot of different things with members of the public certainly not politics or other things like that but we can talk to each other about it and again that helps\nForm a bond and I think we appreciate the pressures that each other or are under and that creates a certain amount of empathy that you might not have another uh enterprises\nI'm there have been times on the court when there have been unpleasant people there um and uh that's made life unpleasant 'cause you do work in such close quarters but I'm\nNow is not one of those times yeah I'm thinking way back\nWhen a
