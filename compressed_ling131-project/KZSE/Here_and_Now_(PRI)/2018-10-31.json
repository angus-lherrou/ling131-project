talk about the power of incumbency he's a political consultants familiar name\nTo political observers here in Minnesota founding director of Wellstone Action and smart car with us associate professor of political science at the University of Arizona or what's the research tell us about the power of those citizen commissions when it comes to more fair redistricting [noise]\nYou know I don't know if there's been enough research yet to tell us how old you know sort of allegedly nonpartisan citizen commissions can help\nEffect gerrymandering but the the evidence of gerrymandering working against it in regional attention there's overwhelming I mean when we compare the the way the districts have been\nUm gerrymandered according to the rule set out with sort of more objective um maps we see a huge discrepancy so you know districts or if they're supposed to be\nUm they're supposed to be a few districts as possible they're supposed to be equally distributed and there's just you can take us we're not supposed to see these crazy shapes but that is completely counter to what we actually see in most states we see a lot of districts bizarre\nShe you know these crazy question mark or like Tetris pieces\nAnd we know immediately that these are not done fairly they are done with partisan goals in mind and that is just simply not the purpose of redistricting and I agree completely with Jeff this is a huge problem I think it's finally gaining a lot of uh you know outrage among among them as public and hopefully these commissions\nWill actually become fruitful we're going to have to wait and see\nSoon as you listen to our conversation develop I Hope you away in here do you think ... years and by the way in Congress often many more years of service in politics\nBut what about this level of experience where you really start to understand and wield some power in Washington on behalf of your constituents how do you weigh those two ideas what's the remedy six five one to two seven six

Manny how do you see this\nHey Manny are you there\nOh shoot we we might have lost um darn it all so Jeff uh as far as coming back to this idea of redistricting\nUh and citizens commissions and you know putting these ballots on the question do you think or are these are questions on the ballot do you think this is more of an indication\nThat the constituents are tuned in to this issue and more knowledgeable about these weirdly drawn districts and legislatures are going to face more pressure from voters who want this to be fair\n[noise] um yeah I Do think there's ... there's more awareness about it uh especially as people have seen 'em what happened after the twenty Ken election and and the district ... um there's a ... some states that are pretty outrageous examples of gerrymandering the Pennsylvania\nAn example where you know it's generally a democratic state at the presidential level but its congressional delegation is overwhelmingly Republican and and that that is really just a matter of how the lines were drawn so there'd been some outrageous examples of redistricting yeah I'm In in the last several years\nAnd when we resolve and by the way yeah yes Wisconsin

legitimately to voters\nAnd you know some are I I'm curious about this because when we talk about the issue wow our our callers are knowledgeable about this and really engaged on it\nWhat often seems to happen is it goes up through the courts and did it and you know voters rarely get to weigh in on this and that's why I'm curious about whether these citizen commissions are a sign that more voters are saying I Want some control over this I'm not satisfied with how the courts handle it\nYeah you know I think that is largely um I mean it's it's it's hard to a grassroots effort we'd have a lot of lawsuits recently for example a league of women voters which I've mentioned before they bring lawsuits are on behalf of the Democratic party arguing that many of these redistricting plans are unconstitutional\nThough it has been coming up through the courts often or from the ground level\nUm and you know the citizen commissions are showing a little bit of problem is but I we still need a few more a few more years your data points to figure out whether they're going to be the solution\nYou know I think the benefit of getting this redistricting issue into the public consciousness is that people will become aware of how important it is to vote even in the ... election right you know it's often people feel as though they vote for the president because that's something that they feel really importantly about\nBut in the midterm elections as a previous caller was saying you don't know the judges are you don't know who the school board officials are\nAnd so voting just doesn't seem quite as relevant but these are certain\nApple who is going to be able to do for district thing in the future and I think that's something that people are really starting to understand and have\nGood Mindy says on Twitter I don't think any political office should be a job for life\nThere should be lifetime term limits for Congress as there are for president it's important to turn over those seats to bring fresh ideas an energy into our governing process to reflect current concern I'm going to get to term limits here in a minute I I think I heard Jeff saying he's not a big fan of them\nUm to the phones to John in Minneapolis Hi John\nHi I'm I'm curious I'm thirty seven and a you know I've got a couple of parents that are eighty and Seventy years old and a you know they happen to vote the way I Do but that said um my parents I expect with modern medicine and they're ... they're going to be around for probably Fifteen to twenty more years now huh hum\nAnd their their you know the ... and the like and I'm just wondering how do your guests feel that um you know with the technology that's evolving certainly that gives us the opportunity to get more information more quickly\nOn and to be more aware of what data points it out you know how people vote say with redistricting or say which is generally like information for voters with this broad spectrum of candidates down do you think that\nDo your guests think that we the biggest challenge we have is literally just I'm fighting this sort of late in the with the generational gap that you know our generation is more keen to like maybe say hey maybe the government should\nAh put money into just making voting and information gathering acceptable to all very quickly like through public funding or do we say we just started a baby or is that are technically running most of the conferences\nIn the United states presently ... sort of like slowly come in the next Twenty years before that like you know it was such a big\nAnd you know John ... what your question reminds me of is do you remember when the\nCapitol Hill and there were the most inane questions about the oh my gosh about the Facebook and technology so that was really good question and some are what what would you say that\nWell you know as I mentioned before the research tends to suggest that term limits might not necessarily be a panacea here\nBecause as several callers have mentioned you know there is a lot of experience that comes with being in Congress however I think what we're seeing is that challengers are much higher quality potentially in recent elections and they had been before so you know one of the reasons that incumbents tend to have such an advantage\nRather more you know the more people I talked to a you know the more they're turned off by someone having been in politics for a long time um you know that was certainly the case with President Trump I mean basically was elected to the highest office in the land without any experience and basically without any kind of campaign um you know and here in Minnesota\nYou're saying the third district um you know dean Philips a complete newcomer yeah you know come into the scene and being able to compete handedly with Erik Paulsen who's been in Congress for ten years and having no trouble a dance having trouble raising money and running an effective campaign\nUm and I think if you look at the Senate race in fact ... who's you know heavily outspent by incumbent Tina Smith and yet she is nipping at her heels\nSo I mean Tina Smith is a pretty new income and ... just to be clear about that\nYeah I mean there's no question about it but you know at the end of the day of money only does so much um and it's really the quality of the candidate the quality of the campaign I don't talk to many voters who told me they had been swayed one way or the other hand because they've seen a political ad in fact I've really heard the opposite more people are turned off by them that anything so [laughter]\nAnd and the I was going to ask you do you I mean a lot of the elections are about change but do you feel that there is a shorter a tolerance among the electorate for you know the people that we sent I don't know four years ago\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoor through October and indoor markets open throughout the winter you can visit farmers' markets of M. P. L. S. dot org for market times in locations\nSo I mean people are pretty disgusted with the tone in Washington I think people are pretty disappointed with both sides of the polarization of both parties and um I I think there's no question that you know people want change and that's kind of a cliche\nBut you know I I put myself in that camp or we'd like to see a more productive Congress we'd like to see you know more serious a candidate so I don't think that that's a bad thing\nUm but voters particularly in Minnesota are very smart and they have they pay a lot of attention and um you know one of the disadvantages of being an incumbent as he actually have to do the work\nAnd you actually have to make tough decisions ... and\nIt's easy for people to come in and you know not having ever had to make a tough decision to be critical of those things\nSo I noted that you just said you'd like a more productive Congress I mean I don't know if you heard the first part of the show where we where we talked about with experience comes knowledge about\nHow Washington works perhaps comes productivity I I don't think this Congress as an example of that but I think about that think about the um job that you're in is a lawyer the more experience you have probably the better and more productive a lawyer you are\nYou can see this from both sides how how does that way out for you\nYeah I mean I think there's a good it's good\nTo have balance in Washington I mean having veterans around that understand the process that are\nVery serious about policy in legislating is a good thing having fresh faces that have fresh ideas you know as a good thing too so I don't think you want to um have too broad a brush when it comes to those things but but certainly I mean as a conservative I'd like to see this Congress tackle entitlement reform I'd like them to see you see them tackle healthcare\nSome experience lawmakers involved in\nThe Dutch absolutely right and that's why you know I've been so supportive of their pulse and I mean this is a guy who was not a very good politician he was a policymaker any ... works very hard on his record of accomplishment is pretty serious um I think that's a good things with their district of somebody that's pretty senior on the ways and Means Committee um\nShow ... I mean this is this is not this isn't a reality t._v. the serious stuff\nAnd some are ... just for your reference um the the big I think debate going on within Erik Paulsen district who has as anti notes as an incumbent\nIs whether he truly represents what the district is and you were saying this before the democracy democracy\nOf of a district might change the voter outlook of the district might change that's what seems to be animating that race and some of the others here in Minnesota and it's it's hard for incumbents I guess to keep ahead of that\nYeah and you know as as any mentioned one of the problems that income it's often face in their elections that they have a voting record you don't\nWrite their their opponent and their voters and look at how they voted ... over the last five ten Fifteen Years and they can point out the vote it may be inconsistencies or decades old votes that may no longer a\nMatch the wishes of the cut constituency and now a challenger has no record as they can just tell you what ever they want to tell you I Know that is a huge advantage\nA call here from Audrey in Minneapolis Hi Audrey you're thinking about term limits yes\nWell I'm originally I was very close to term limits um but in order for the federal offices to have term limits I Believe they'd have to go through a constitutional amendment because the\nPresidential term limits were dug through through amendment I'm almost positive that the one with the twenty fifth or whatever but at any rate um but when I stopped to think about it\nAnd I saw people like Chuck Grassley who have been around for so long and this caller before talked about him these people are so out of touch with mainstream America right now they are trying to push do throats of American agendas that were popular thirty five years ago\nI honestly believe that if we were going to look\nA term limits Thirty years a generation is enough time for anyone to be in one job\nI mean most people do while you're at so if you're talking about generations I mean what would be the term limit on someone like Chuck Grassley or Patrick Leahy who by the way was also there when Anita Hill testified I mean what would be the fair limit than if you if you want to put a generational frame on this\nUm well the caller just events to my earlier point that you know Minnesota voters are are pretty intelligent and well educated you know at the end of the day we have term limits right now and that powers with a voters so people can decide hey that person's head an off I mean I I agree I mean when you look at that adult could that\nCould that panel using fresh faces certainly but\nThe people of Iowa have the right to send home ever they want and Minnesota does too and uh you know at the end of the day if someone's been there forever I'm kudos to the income or the challenger to take them on\nBut I I I I think you know voter voters are pretty intelligent and if they want to vote somebody out because they think of frustrations needed them you know have that I\nAgree but some are I mean this is the whole essence of the show a lot of power comes with incumbency it is not easy to put up a challenger a serious challenger to somebody like Grassley or lay here whatever all these people that have been there for so long it is not simple to just go will throw him out if you're not happy\n[noise] yeah and you know I I Am very sympathetic to to the caller is you know general [noise] you know concern that some of these some of these people seem like they've been there forever and they don't seem to be necessarily representing um their constituents\nWhen you when you're looking at the candidates that you disagree with Joe Biden was in office for is\nThirty years for decades yeah though and right so there's there's their candidates arrogant\nPolitician that people like in his politicians that people don't lake and often they they're both in office for a very long time so I don't know of term limits would necessarily solve the problem of um [noise] you know getting people out of office who don't seem to agree with their constituents I think we're always going to have those\nHair and asks if you do your job well I don't have any problem with you continuing to do your job president is such a unique and powerful position that unique limits make more sense\nThan for Congress or legislators smart ... ... it does that make sense for you to we put an eight year time limit on President but that's not that's not a compelling enough reason to limit members of Congress\n[noise] well you know I think the basis for a term loving the presidency is very different from I'm from the lack of term limits for Congress met for Congress people and senators and that is because we wouldn't want the country to turn into you know a dictatorship and the president\nFrankly has a lot of towers that these congresspeople and Sanders don't have the president could use executive orders to their advantage and without a ... and without term limits on that could lead to some pretty\nUm you know undemocratic situations so I think the type that officer they are just so different that we can't really compare them when it comes to weigh one his term limits on the other doesn't\nUh Brooke uh says on Twitter Andy do your guest see any correlation between dark money in politics and term limits with term limits reduced dark money's influence what do you think Andy\nI'm I don't think so you know dark money be objective of dark money is to influence politics policy decisions not just to see people that are a lot to like um and I think you know we we we have uh\nSeeing the way we do it um you know basically people can give as much as they want without any kind of accountability I mean I think the the way to do that as is make it a little bit easier for people to take donations um that are visible you know again if\nYou've done what how would that work\nWell I mean like members of Congress for instance can only take so so much from an individual and so therefore they have to spend a lot of time making sure that they you know raise a lot of money from a lot of people versus being able to take a larger donations in which case we know about that we have that transparency immediately so if I'm a politician and I've taken a big donation from someone\nI'm probably going to be pretty darn careful [laughter] that I don't do anything\nThat looks like there's a conflict of interest I don't know I mean Andy how do you explain some of the drug pricing policy when you see what

engineering they're making progress toward those targets motivating your employees in holding yourself accountable the best companies do that and let me just say with other companies they're still work to be done\nI think of least got got started Walmart on our sustainability\nPeople talk about a lot about Paul Pullman at Unilever off at times after there's a really green CEO the next CEO isn't quite as green because they don't feel like the owner as much can you think of that company where there was a really green CEO followed by an equally passionate green CEO\nHere's what I Know about CEOs as one as one myself as a every CEO wants to put their own mark going to come down and a smart was built on the best things that their predecessors did but they make they put their own mark on it\nUm leave Scott is been succeeded by to CEOs who now Doug McMillan who's the current CEO Walmart\nLaunched project ... and has made it one of the signatures of his work in that company and his conviction that they are a company full of good people who wants to make a difference in the world and Dave sustainability has become a hallmark of that company\nWhen ... stepped down as the c._e._o. of coke he was succeeded by moved toward cat and a ... put his own mark on sustainability by\nI'm continuing to work on water but also combining that with coax leadership on women's issues and looking at water and women in the context\nTwo pillars of their sustainability and social impact work [noise] so what we've seen is the best companies find a way to continue it because\nIt's not just a marketing tool it is fundamental to who they are and their comparative advantage with coke or they were determined because of a water crisis to become a leader on water\nAnd Walmart is determined to be a leader on sustainability and um McDonalds who's been after the sustainability issues for twenty five years and didn't realize that you know they're um they started way back in the day\nWhen I'm a young staffer and Environmental Defense fund work with them to eliminate Styrofoam packaging and both the ATF\nWhere my wife worked and McDonald's received surprise the rose garden for those initial steps and looking at supply chains and now they built on that with the science space targets initiative that brings that to scale so the best companies it becomes\nPart of the working with with who they are and it just changes leader to leader\nBut I certainly know from Walmart they don't do anything that doesn't make economic sense there's no squishy numbers and everything has to save energy as a proxy for waste saving waste is saving money so this is really\nAbout dollars and earnings per share\nOne thing I've learned his every company is different you generalize companies that your peril in for Walmart delivering goods to people at the lowest possible price is fundamental to their business model and part of the power of\nThe shift to a noble energy and avoiding food waste and more efficient transportation is it removes costs from their supply chain\nTwice to the consumer for coke it's a company that it's a marketing engine and their ability to reach people make them aware of the issues of water create a movement um water um make people feel like they're part of a solution is a lot of the motivation for coke\nAnd so what we've learned is every company is different every company navigates what they bring to social issues differently\nAnd the smart ones use their um uh that would I called her superpowers whether its supply chain to power the buyer marketing\nIn Silicon

people are claiming city in states can forget Donald Trump cities and states can can can\nWas cities in states but I think they're that their contribution and isn't some environmental corners being over so\nI think it's being appropriately captured as taking a big chunk out of the problems that we have for making forward progress at a time when our federal government is not doing what it should do\nAnd creating the foundations the momentum to lead to a moment where we would put a price on carbon and we would create regulatory framework that matters because [noise]\nThe at some point in the

this country in that moment it's going to come sooner rather than later so to me all these work stream some sub national action\nIs all about demonstrating that action is happening\nThat more is needed a comparing solutions and creating relationships where it can happen but keeping the pressure on that a national regulatory framework is still important and all of the nation to the world when they get back together again in Poland\nOr going to have to double down on their commitments because\nWe are not on path to reach that goal set in Paris\nAnd there's quite a debate actually within

we've got one week before the midterm elections what are some of the big themes that the president is really knocking hard we've got obviously immigration what else are you seeing\nThe president is going very hard on illegal immigration as you mentioned he has brought up a very unlikely proposal but one that he thinks it's going to motivate folks which is a ten percent tax cut on the middle class\nThe president has continued his barrage of assaults on the media\nAnd in the last few days he has really dialed up his critique of the Democratic party that has meant something to really unified Republicans pointing to what he sees as kind of the extremes of the Democratic party\nYou know and I'm Wondering the president has made no secret of his thoughts on migrants coming from Central America from Mexico with the very beginning of his campaign so\nIs there a reason why he's still really doubling down on immigration um what does that strategy tell us as opposed to health care or as opposed to other issues that he should be looking at\nThis is a an election that's really based on motivating his base nationalizing the selection around his supporters because the question that Republicans have always had as there were a number of people who turned out for Donald Trump mutts\nAll of them and the question was would they come out and turn out for\nA member of Congress or a candidate for the house\nAnd that has been a much tougher thing to answer and so\nIf Donald Trump goes out there and says this midterms is really about me my policies are on the ballot you'll remember rock Obama said that and it turned into a scandal will Donald Trump has been saying that exact thing and it's it's a way for him to ah to make this about himself\nIn a way to really sort of rile up his supporters\nAre what I Would say about illegal immigration that he's focused on is this has been a constant focus as you pointed out I mean going back to the beginning of his campaign obviously earlier this spring he went really hard on the MS Thirteen gang\nAnd started using terms like animals to describe people which are generated a lot of backlash and so what he's doing is we we flash forward to the beginning of October\nAnd the president's political team started to get a whole bunch of polling data come back to them about this issue of immigration saying that in a lot of these marginal districts these competitive house districts where Donald Trump is not always seen as a help\nIllegal immigration was resonating with folks this whole idea of the Republican Party being sort of the protectors of immigration and customs agents there was an abolish ice movement on the left obviously and so that\nWhole issue was resonating and what happened was the the president sort of\nHad this migrant caravan issues sort of land in his lap after they had already decided that they were going to really close on illegal immigration\nAnd and there's also the the recent news that the president has decided to send troops to the southern border we should also remind our listeners that this migrants caravan if you will the folks who are migrating are still weeks away from even

R. go dot com and I I spent a lotta time photographing her um\nI I knew that as difficult as this photograph was to take\nAnd ... as difficult it is for the the viewers just to see\nI I knew that this was going to be an important picture and unimportant photograph to be seen because uh she she really sums up how tragic and how bad the the malnutrition and the starvation has really become and Yemen\nAnd Tyler ... there is often a debate about traumatic images right\nOn the one hand people will say they're just too traumatic to publish and to look at um on on the other hand there are people who say are they exploiting people who are in their most vulnerable state and as a photo journalist I'm Wondering how do you grapple with those\nIssues I never take photographs that are difficult to look at just for the sake of of getting a traumatic photo or sometimes there's a reason to document things that can be difficult to look at it and and this was one of those cases\nThere's a lot of suspicion that goes into both taking the photographs than to file the photographs to the New York times and then there's a whole team of people there who decide\nWhether that image or images will appear in the newspaper\nThis is one of the cases where I think it's really important for these photographs be saying I mean there has not been a lot of coverage out of Yemen it's it's a very difficult place to get to because the travel restrictions they're western journalists not\nTo go there so when we can see what's happening that's an opportunity for us to to show what's what's happening in the country is as difficult as it is\nAnd Tyler have we become desensitized to images like this and the crisis in Yemen over all um because I just think back to what two years ago when there was an image of a toddler or that the Syrian refugee crisis in this town there you know was dead on the beach on the shore and I just think\nThat image was so powerful and like are we becoming desensitized to the ... out there because we're just\nThere's so much going on right now\nI think yes but at the same time it that doesn't affect the way I think that\nI should be doing my job or about how the media should be covering these places you catch tried to deconstruct what people sensitivities are\nAnd in effect quarantine what you what you choose to show I think it's the more people become used to these things actually the more that you should be out there covering them because people need to be reminded of what's happening out there but all that being said it's extremely important to keep the temple up\nAnd to continue to get these images out there\nAnd had them scene and to get a reaction from and of course some people will disagree with that they'll think that these photographs shouldn't be shown wonder why would you show you know these these children who are are starving to death I mean there there was another photograph that ran as part of that I was at the same hospital\nAnd um as people were praying in their their six children often with their mothers being completely malnourished and unable to breastfeed or to to give any nutrition for them\nAnd it was a child photographs and um eight hours later that that that child died I found out the next day and uh that's just\nWitness to such a young and and it said a life that then is just gone you know you hear it the next day though that that child died and the people who are volunteering and working in these clinics are they're kind of becoming used to it\nTyler Hicks is a staff photographer for
