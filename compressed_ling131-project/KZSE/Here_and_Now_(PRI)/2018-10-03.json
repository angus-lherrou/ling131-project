I ... I have a plead that as we figure all of it out and I have more things are released an ad for visitors visit his his home in his place of\nCreating the gift that we do not forget\nWhen he was passionate about giving back to community giving back to people giving back to young people being a vision of possibilities for young people he was committed to helping young people get caught up in this mess that we are in for such a ton of his he was a for such a time of this\nMan activists artist we cannot lose that in all of\nThis so whoever's owning a bit family be whomever which has to honor him fight\nRobin did I hear you say that you were at the ceremony because for the honorary ceremony yeah the here I think you were there to yes that I see that what what what what was it like\nWas bittersweet um you know this was something that they had begun planning to do while he was a still with us and my understanding is when he heard about it\nOh you know this would have been something that he would have been here and I think prince was entering this phase of his his life and his career where he was be he was this elder statesmen of music both for the reasons that Robin has talked about in terms of his looking after\nThe issues affecting communities but also the way that he wanted to mentor younger artists whether it'd be people like Janelle Monday or others\nAnd you know I think he was he was entering that phase where he would receive these kinds of um you know awards and recognition also because a lot of the people who are in positions to best do those things grew up on his music and we're now in positions to to recognize him in this way so it was it was bittersweet and I think\nOf a few of the speakers there talked about how this was this was there a love letter to him you know in in respect of the way that he upheld and celebrated Minnesota in Minneapolis and certainly the the local communities that birth to him you know this was something that he did not forget\nAnd you don't want anything interesting things about in that performance of Seventeen Days that's on this release\nUm he ... he does this you know he says his lyric you know I Know you're holding another and he says and where he was like I Know you're holding and now the N. word tight\nAnd I I thought that was interesting because this this release you know this was recorded on the cusp of his purple rain\nWhere people began to speculate about his racial identity and he may have participated in that speculation was the white was the black was he makes was he this was that in in in this performance of Seventeen Days he like admits that\nAnd it's very clear that I'm In the black community and I know you're holding another person tight as in the black community and I think he's situated himself very early on and and certainly in his final days among us very squarely in the black community and and concerned about the issues affecting not just the black community but everyone else as well\nWalter ... called ... I remember the scene\nIt was to the basement and he finds his dad's old music and it kind of reminds me of this situation and us finding his music I think he wanted us to find dead end to Nikki ... Hi Nicky thanks for waiting oh no problem for having yeah yeah so what are you thinking about what's your question\nSo my question is you know obviously beyond the music there our motivations you know such as money and things that come from\n... from the release of those songs and I'm kinda curious about who would be profiting from those and if there's a financial aspect to to those recordings\nWondered about this to gym do you ... do you know anything about that\nWell the the fact of the matter is that the music business and twenty Eighteen Nineteen is not as profitable as it was in the Nineteen eighties no release that comes out is going to sell millions of copies\nA it's an and and I don't know where the uh state is that I Know they have a big tax bill that they're going to have to deal with and there's issues with pays a park and with maintaining that as a\nAs a enterprise um there's a lot of speculation on the business side so\nYou know the the thing when he was with us he could generate money by going on the road ... kind of at the snap of fingers you know he could any off and did it at the snap your fingers like I'm going to play at twenty thousand seat venue in three days and he could sell it out is that\nRight that he would make a decision like that at the last minute and they'd pull it together\nUm but but now that that revenue stream has gone so [noise] I don't know the all the details on the finances but I you know I I don't think that this kind of this type of releases it can be looked at as something that's going to be netting tens of millions of dollars and so right right\n... who says will we ever be able to stop with the seemingly never ending shows about prince Sean I Will say it's been on and on more than a year since I've

[laughter] uh and\nYou say it's only just begun because there's so much more music to come out of the vault do do you guys so much\nMore than ... and and you know we have only just begun to unpack

most voters say healthcare is one of the top issues if not the top issue they are concerned about this year this hour you can learn more\nProposals to improve our health care and health insurance system sometimes called single payer DFL state senator John Marty of Roseville has been a leading proponent of single payer anti discuss this idea\nWith Republican state senator Scott ... who is also a medical doctor the two senators met at the University of Minnesota Humphrey school on Monday with professor Larry Jacobs moderating\n... let me start with you uh we've had some enormous changes in health reform a lot of people or maybe just catching their breath\nAfter the for double CARE Act was passed by President Obama we've had efforts to repeal it and there have certainly been some changes but the basic Skelton to the program remains\nHow do you feel about that program has just been you know kind of a landmark we should be focused on improving or something we need to kind of scrap these are from the beginning I I'd say it's somewhere it's\nThe landmark program it's not the solution to things\nUm I was working are proposed Minnesota health plan about the same time of year before President Obama was elected and putting our thing out there and I suggested we need a fix to the problem not a tinkering with the problem and it was more than tinkering because it it did cut the insurance rates\nA number of people without insurance by half it didn't fundamentally change the system in a way that helps\nTake advantage of the excellent providers an excellent healthcare system we have and make it accessible to everyone we still have millions of people who can't afford any health insurance we have millions millions tens of millions hundreds of millions\nWho have insurance but they can't afford to get the care they need the co pays the duck doubles the lack of coverage for dental the lack of coverage for other things um so I I favor did is better than what we had before as a state legislator I didn't have a role in it I'm In my pitch was like\n... and I'm here here we've got this new system that's rolled out Minnesota was in the forefront of implementing both the exchange which is known in Minnesota as measure\nUh we also created what's known as the basic health plan which is our men care program and uh we've seen lots of expansion of\nThe uh medical assistance was expanded Medicaid program so lots of change um how are you feeling about where things are and and whether the Affordable CARE Act is you know the framework we should be kind of working on [noise]\nI think that the Affordable CARE Act did bring some real positive to the to the marketplace if you will in the marketplace being the marketplace of ideas I think that allowing a children's day on their parents' plans to twenty six was an idea that was probably passed do [noise]\nI also think it brought a a real a bright light onto the notion of pre pre existing conditions and this isn't just a a\nSome sort of elusive concept to me this is something I've addressed over the last thirty five years taking care of patients\nI've seen the six year old come in with uh the diagnosis of type one diabetes\nSo in other words saying oh it's going to cost so much to do this yes healthcare is extremely expensive it's um it was one\nTwentieth every economy forty fifty years ago now it's one sixth of our economy it's going to be one fifth of our economy soon it's huge sector the economy and it's very expensive my argument is less expensive but we're doing now is the right direction is it\nVery affordable well it's more affordable than us\nOr to build and the solutions others are coming up with because they're not coming up with solutions neither party is\nOther than a single payer system by single logical way to deliver health care neither party is coming up with him last year the Republicans offered for profit insurance companies in Minnesota because that was going to solve the problem and so we allow them into the ...\nVote for profit insurance company can only meet its financial obligation to its shareholders by one of two ways maximizing profit either by raising premiums or by cutting benefits and neither of those are things we want to accomplish in health care so it seems to me that the ideas are being thrown out by the\nPolitical parties and the regular discussion aren't helping and that a single payer system that while very expensive is less expensive and we're doing now make sense\nA center Marty let me just get back to the nuts and bolts here because I think a lot of folks are attracted by the vision you're offering but are probably wondering\nWow how much would this cost Vermont which is for those who haven't been there it's in the northeast it's so liberal a status God this is where Bernie Sanders comes from a and in two thousand eleven and how to democratic\nLiberal governor and the Democratic liberal legislature they passed the first single payer long and they got to work and they made a very a determined effort to deliver the governor said we're going to leave the country and this\nAnd a twenty fourteen the same governor report it to the state he said you know\nThis was going to cost over I'm a several billion dollars we're gonna have to increase taxes payroll and other taxes and we cannot afford it it costs almost as much as the entire annual budget for the state\nSo how do you avoid that situation years you get a governor here in Minnesota you're leading majorities in both chambers and\nSingle payer actually vote for it are we heading for fiscal disaster\nA couple of comments when it first of all Vermont's wasn't what I Would call a single payer it was going to cover about a third of their population that's not what I Would describe as a single system covering everyone so they didn't get the administrative savings and other things like that\nIf a single payer system is less expensive and I'd be happy to go into why it should be less expensive even though we're covering more people for more things\nIf it's less expensive than we are already paying the higher costs now and how we structure the payments in a fair way is the logical thing to do so instead of paying your\nPremium under our bill the premiums you'd be paying based on ability to pay wouldn't be paid to private insurance company or through your employer they'd be paid to the\nMinnesota health plan does not stop\nAt the government is not the government does not we at the legislature don't have we spend that might well we need more money for roads your education no this money goes like Social Security goes directly to the fund that's going to pay out Social Security benefits and find goes directly to that only be spent on that\nAnd if the premiums that we pay to that instead of that if you call it that its own new government spending then it costs more\nFor government spending it's less spending overall because if if there's less expensive which again I'd be happy to give the two biggest reasons is less expensive but if it is less expensive that means we're spending more than that now we'd be spending less to do it\nYou've raised a lot of issues and I want to turn to a center Jensen that give him his opportunity but before I Do I just want to ask you to have you had a group of economists are others come up with some numbers on what your plan would cost us that happened\nHave been asking governor Dayton actually was put in one year he put it in half million dollars to study this and another alternative proposal to see how it would compare to what we're spending that we have not been able to do that I've been pushing legislatively to get that for years\nDiscussions like this now suggest we are going to get that to happen there have been a number of studies have single payer including in Minnesota they suggest is less expensive period but your plan has not been costs that outlined has not been cost it out and we're working on that\nSenator Jensen I'm curious if your reactions to a senator Marty's characterization of\nAh the portability of single parent is just not have Jacobs I ah I'm at the edge of my seat right now I'm I'm hearing that we're going to get everything and we won't pay more than our share and there's two ways that's going to make it affordable [noise]\nI don't want to make another comment without hearing those two things that will make this a what sounds like Pollyanna so if we could turn back to the center Marty I think that'd be great because I had to ...\nYes the first way we have to bring down costs is through price negotiation sue fair price\nState of Minnesota to study in January they've been putting out numbers every couple of months they did it on simple ... replacement ranged from I think forty seven hundred dollars to forty six thousand dollar eight to one price disparity they've found for simple knee replacement nationally two years earlier Yale study\nThree four hundred was the cheapest one fifty five thousand eight hundred was the most expensive\nFor your math at sixteen to one price disparity the low in hospital is not losing money on that they set that price that's what they collect for the surgery\nThey're not losing money on it they're making money\nThe one that's charging sixteen times as much for the same procedure is making real good money and we need a logical system\nYou can't buy one car and you go to one dealer versus another dealer and find sixteen hundred percent difference in cost you might say five or ten percent there is no logical price negotiation system in the current system that's a huge cost savings there\nYou may not bring it down to thirty four hundred for every new replacement surgery but you're going to be stopping the bizarre situation we're in now and the second one is administering\nPercent administrative savings in the simplest way to illustrate this may be to talk about an allergy of the way we fund our public schools versus the way we fund our hospitals\nIf we were to fund our school is the way we find our hospitals every teacher I have to calculate how much time he or she spent with every student\nHow many supplies they use them send it down to the schools building office which would fall in all the administrative overhead the capital expenses that\nThe janitorial and supplies everything else utilities then they send out bills every month for the parents school insurance plans\nNot these are expensive plans because education is extremely expensive so employers would obviously have to step in and provide school insurance coverage for their employees kids not everybody's going to have employer coverage so they have it we create a market place for them and that's expensive too so we subsidize that\nAnd a lot of people even if they have the coverage that can't afford the co pays and deductibles so the school needs the collections agency to do that\nThink of all the administrative costs the school puts in place from this how much time at ways to the parents think of all of the school insurance plans and all of the bureaucracies they all have that's not a small detail that's a huge detail what do we do that to our schools I Hope not\nWith a huge increase costs and take time away from learning and put it into a building and collection you under eliminate that that's a huge savings and both of those two things those are the two biggest reasons there are thousands of little things in\nIn pharmaceuticals and other things senator jumped somebody ready to respond\nI Am thinking I've seen a lot of people out there with paper and pencil so if you don't mind the ... I'd I'd love it if you just write some of these numbers down\nAnnually right now in Minnesota we spend approximately fifty billion dollars on health care approximately six billion are spent by Minnesota on the MA plaza approximately six billion that that's the medical assistance plan for medical ... six billion is backed by the federal to support\nApproximately ten billion is spent on Medicare which is funded by the federal program but we get those dollars and we spend that out so we have ten billion six billion for him a Minnesota six billion for MA fed\nThen we have fourteen billion paid in premiums and then we have another fourteen billion and basically from coming from you folks deductibles co insurance is I'm Out of pocket payments if you will\nSo we have fourteen billion coming from the people fourteen billion in in employer premiums we have six billion to fund half of the medical assistance and others another six billion to fund the half because that's a fifty fifty split with the vets and then you have ten billion from Medicare that number comes to fifty billion dollars\nLet's say that a company like Blue Cross which was founded in Nineteen twenty nine and has innovated more and more than you could ever imagine there in the paper two days ago and that Blue Cross has come up with\n... they said we need to look harder at why do we have these social inequities between how the health and wellness of one race or one group fair versus we're seeing the same thing with health partners in cargo right now in terms of putting together an opioid toolkit\nSo we've seen innovation comes from the private sector over and over again but let's get back to the number let's say that the insurance companies are taking too much money that eighty five percent loss ratio which means that for every hundred dollars of coming in premiums they spend eighty five dollars to pay for services so they're left with Fifteen Percent in that piece of Obamacare\nA single payer that you get something like Seventy percent say and then as soon as you say now that would mean that all your health care would come through the government and you basically be in a situation like the VA or or or Medicare you Blue Cross would go away why don't want that\nI mean it changes when you start to define what we're talking about and that's why I think we really do need to define our\nTerms the single payer Canadian health care system is not single payer it's private insurers patients in the government to tune in Seventy percent Canada's got thirty one million people almost\nFive percent of live within a hundred miles of the U.S border so they've always got that potential to church system where they need to they can always chewed on down to dilute and I have patients that have done that that are Canadian and they'll go down to Duluth and get something done because they would have had to wait ten months\nIf the student stayed in Canada I had a patient in about a month ago came in those kind of ... bought me a poster of what he saw because he was in Canada touring in the summer and he had a medical problem come up and so he went in to get healthcare\nRight in their exam rooms they listed how long the way it would be if you needed an elected MRI it was going to be ten months before he could get your elective MRI so I think we really need to try to talk about the specifics [noise]\nIf I could get back to\nThe essential health benefits\nIf we're really going to bring commonsense to our health care industry is going to come from you folks it's not going to come from the politicians because we don't have the spine to make the tough decisions were going to bail 'cause we're always worried about the next election and maybe you won't send us a check I mean that's where we go it's really hard\nWe need you folks to say I don't want that that Lipitor might sound find you doc but you know I've seen the data and for every hundred people that take the Lipitor really in a measurable impact only two out of the hundred will get a benefit [noise] why is it\nIowa but two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to die in Manhattan New York it's because of the people it's because of that kind of decisions are making it's kind of advice again from the docks so let me just stop you there because I think this was an issue you're both talking about\nRight through your both talking about the fact that there is extraordinary access a vet we're paying and this helps explain why ... why America is spending about Eighteen percent of our gross domestic product\nAlmost one out of five dollars and you're both pointing your finger at the prices that um the doctors in particular the hospitals are charging um and let's not forget the pharmaceuticals\nSo is it possible senator Marty it's just focus on that issue not say we've got to do the whole enchilada\nIs that kind of incremental approach or because I think\nI think I'm I'm hearing Sen Jensen accurately he's saying you know when I'm ready to roll up my sleeves I'm ready to kind of you know stand up to some of my colleagues have just say forget it we're not going to even talk about this but he wants to see something that's specific and concrete and not the save the world approach\nThink the we have some commonality he wrote I wrote a book on health care he said he didn't agree with everything he wrote a book on healthcare doctor patient relationships I agreed with virtually everything in it\nBecause I think medical decisions should be I don't want a government run health care system I want a patient and Dr run healthcare system and I think the only way you're going to get that is to a system like this incremental approach I Want to make sure we cover everyone that's the bottom line\nI'm not willing to live without it I don't want to live with a system that says well we're going to let decisions being made by insurance companies are government or somebody else\nAnd when ... when you talk about how you know well if you if you give it to people whatever they want they're going to be spending twenty thirty percent more I don't know where you come up with that number I haven't seen it\nAnd now is economic analysis of this bottom line is people do want more health care if they're not getting enough healthcare\nNobody wants more health care I don't know anybody in this room was gonna say\nOh I Love health care and it's all free you know I think I'll go get me another colon are skipping next week there's been was\nCentered giants are ready to ask for dinner Marty I applaud your ah your example of the call and ask me but let me give you another [noise] [laughter] my parents died of it and so I probably would be one of those people that my wife is still the one who pushes me go get your call and ask it but\nI Do agree with you completely I think the moral imperative is that we need to provide some basic core package of health care to everyone we're past discussing it we need to get it done I'm with you all the way [noise] but I think Iran in terms of human behavior\n[noise] and it's not bad but if you watch us when we go through a buffet line and we paid our ticket\nWe gorgeous shells and eat things to the tune that we would never do that I remember I went to this restaurant called ... child when I got done eating there I didn't want to see a piece of beef for a year I almost got nauseated driving by the country's sightseeing account [noise]\nNo we do when we don't have to pay for our behavior changes folks we can\nSay that that isn't bad that's just too we are I have patients every day\nComing to the doctor what about a chest X ray and once you're listening well you know my mom used to get them because they came around to the neighborhoods and they took them remember mom getting a chest X ray and the neighborhoods in sleepy eye but the bottom line is if someone has a friend who wasn't a smoker and they got lung cancer\nOftentimes look and say you don't have the confidence been sort of nagging I think maybe a cat's gonna be a good idea when that's your lungs are perfectly clear you haven't any weight loss you haven't kept up any blood in Uganda medicine that causes a cough let's stop the medicine first\nIs our appetite has driven by the circumstances that govern our lives as legislators were called to legislate including\nOur foibles as human and we have in our self perhaps the first thing we should do is legislators should have the exact same kind of health care that you do and if we did\n[noise]\nThen maybe we we'd be more intellectually honest certainly at the federal level they have quite a health care plan I tell you I I Can't believe it but I don't think you can trust doctors like you used to be able to were too jaded we've Trump the Kool Aid you have to trust your own got\n... ... is not for everybody to see the article a couple of months ago became I said you know one Lipitor in people over the age of sixty five that don't have the diagnosis of diabetes or heart disease is not a good thing\nI got an article last week in the journal says does Lipitor help prevent the onset of dementia and I thought well this will be a good one I read the article\nIn the last paragraph sue well no it doesn't and never mind the fact that ... can actually cause a ... syndrome consisting of memory loss and confusion because if it does do they just stop and it'll probably go away [noise]\nThis is a kind of stuff and it does do Staten drugs causes diabetes yes we know what does you know what our literature tells us if I put you ma'am unlimited during that caused you to have diabetes\nAt that point in time you might say she was let's stop the Lipitor and see if the diabetes goes away no medical literature says I should up to ... because you know have diabetes and the standards for your ... your cholesterol measurements are now we have to lower lower now how does that and we do this every day\nSo you're part of the solution were part of the problem and you can't have it all excessive so ... just let me follow up with a one of the points that you've been gently making gently\nYeah I think even gently questioning of the role in scope of government you've you've presented that in fact\nThe most graceful way I've heard from a Republican and some time and I appreciate that I'm so let me ask you this because we're now getting data we're almost two years into the Trump Administration and we're getting some data here in Minnesota the on insurance rate is up almost fifty percent\nAnd one of the things we're hearing from a those who are no longer insured which is over three hundred and fifty thousand Minnesotans who've lost their insurance is that they can't afford it\nThat their coverage a has gone away does that lead you to think we've got to be careful here and government has a fairly substantial role to play here uh and that we need to be looking for ways maybe not to go as far as senator Marty but\nLooking for ways to expand of the government involvement with regard to affordability and coverage\nThank you professor Jacob's that's a great question center Marty and I had a chance to discuss this issue on a different program probably six months ago\nAnd after that discussion on many of the points he made a really um pushed me to get more data and learn more so I called Stefan Gilda ... who works for the department of health and if it's something I Need to understand who these three hundred and fifty four hundred thousand people are in Minnesota that don't have health care what does it look like what what what's the face of these people\nAnd so he got me a probably five or six pages of the data and then I called them so let's go over it\nMore than half the people that don't have coverage in Minnesota right now are eligible we have to help them get signed up to half say a hundred and Seventy five thousand that aren't there's at least a third of those probably could become eligible if\nWe tapped into all the sources we have so we're talking about literally less than two percent [noise] in\nSupported by the

me so lots to unpack here but let's start with your brought assessment is what the New York times found fraud\nThere certainly parts of this that are fraud there are parts of it that are um tax avoidance or tax minimization that is perfectly well within the confines of the law and then there are parts of that that you know very significantly cross the line\nAnd we of course should mention that the president's lawyer told the New York times that the allegation of tax fraud innovations were quote one hundred percent false and highly defamatory\nUm despite that the times found two hundred and Ninety five distinct streams of revenue created by Fred Trump to help transfer this money to his son Donald Trump\nWhich is quite frankly I'm a pretty incredible and one of the ways that they did that was by creating a company called all county building supply and maintenance and they use that company to supposedly by things like cleaning supplies but in the times investigation they found that basically it was a shell company was the company on paper\nAnd they would mark up the cost of products as a way of transferring the money is on tax gifts is that tax fraud\nBelieve that it is based on my review of the allegations in the times article if if those facts are true this is tax fraud and one of the key concepts in tax law is that the economic substance needs to match what you put on paper and what you report to the IRS and this company had no\nAre funneling gifts from the president's father to the president has siblings\nOne or the other things we mentioned at the top is that the uh the trumps also undervalued they're real estate properties\nAnd according to this investigation and the New York times Fred Trump's Nineteen Ninety five gift tax return he claimed that twenty five apartment complexes he owned were valued at forty one point four million but the New York times says the bank value was actually near nine hundred million what about that is it clear that that's\nTax fraud it's not as clear um because you need to understand the way that valuations occur and the kinds of discounting that is is actually appropriate and in normal when looking at a minority interest in a company\nSo you start with a value and if if that value is wrong then everything following it is wrong and in this case it looks like that value is probably wrong\nBut it's not as clear cut because we we don't have the competing evaluations done by another expert as of the same approximate date we're looking at things that happened years after and things do change over the course of time\nI Would say that that does evaluations are highly likely to be wrong but whether it'd and subject to civil penalties whether that amounts to fraud or not is more questionable\nBut I guess the question that this is sort of all coming from our tax code in the United states which I think you know I Want to warn listeners don't let your eyes glaze over when I say tax code um who does the tax code favor I mean is it something that wealthier\nFamilies in wealthier Americans are more savvy about and know how to make get their way around these types of loopholes\nYeah I\nWealthy Americans are more savvy but I also think they need\nHere is that the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest individuals and families you know it only kicks in now this year if when you die you have more than eleven million dollars\nSo it's not like these people are avoiding attacks that is generally applicable to the rest of the population like when they are avoiding income tax and other people are paying their fair share of income tax\nIn a state tax you know it's I it's a creation of Congress that only applies to the wealthy and then there are other creations of Congress that minimize the amount those same people have to pay\nA and if you follow the rules um then you're abiding by the law the problem here is that the rules were not really followed\nIt feels like they weren't followed but it also I think for a lot of Americans I think there's a sense of frustration among those of us who pay our taxes and don't you know find these loopholes and and are paying a significant amount of our income in taxes versus the wealthy who kind of seem to be able to get around this\nI think that's more of a valid complaint with income tax with a state tax none of the rest of us pay estate tax do the wealthy pay estate tax yes significant portions of it and you know sometimes they can minimize the amount that they have to pay ... and\nWhat is that what you know is that normal behavior of the ultra wealthy in this country\nMinimizing the amount of state taxes absolutely normal behavior committing fraud to do it is not normal behavior or how do we distinguish the two you have to look at the amounts and whether the violation of law is willful\nAnd you know the IRS as a whole set of penalties that that they used to apply based on how undervalued the properties we're in the estate tax

in the United states [noise]\nAfter about three used the statistics show that about top people are half the people coming out will return to custody and what is\nIs there a driving force for that recidivism\nIt's a lot of different things it's not just to return to criminal ah returned to criminal behavior\nIs in the study I was doing in Boston talking to people coming out of state prison in Massachusetts the biggest predictor of a return to custody was relapse to addiction that took many different forms sometimes people will committing crimes to support their habits or\nSometimes they were in the middle of the ... getting in fights and other conflicts or sometimes they were violating the condition to their parole and filing a drug\nBig piece of this I think is a honestly a public health crisis or among people with a struggling with addiction\nAnd you know our producer Alexandra without at a meeting with men who had come out of prison after many many many years and there is this recurring theme of fear of going back do you find that in your research that that there is a fear that these these folks who are coming out of\nPrison are very aware of their own likelihood of relapse thing or are going back yeah yeah\nAnd I think part of that is the ah ease the stress of incarceration that people often reported to us and and people who were struggling with addiction on
