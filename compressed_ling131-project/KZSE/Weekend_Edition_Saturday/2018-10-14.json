Navarro\nThe terms are less than a month away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate House and many will also choose governors over the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country\nBut this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe just said that's highly so can Democrats cut into the geo piece edge among governors they haven't really good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more\nFor them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be a census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's gonna be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they're sort of a hamster surprising opportunities for Democrats in the Midwest and in the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by Pfizer for education and teacher funding and you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republicans\nArea of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and terrorists is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are off favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much\nThank you abolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the call gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but who don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining

Navarro\nThe terms are less than a month for white voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate House and many will also choose governors over the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the\nTwenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors they haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be a census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor of from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really you have a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state that is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they're sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've ever\nAnd that's rations in Kansas and Oklahoma both of those states have been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally\nYou only narrowly won his primary health care's driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont still Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you [noise]\nIce has been a rallying cry for some on

Jersey\nAfter nearly five tense hours Hudson County voted to end the eyes contract but\nNot until twenty twenty that way the county would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets
