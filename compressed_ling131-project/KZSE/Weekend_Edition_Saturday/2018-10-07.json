joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a\nBitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and\nFor each other after all\nThey are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives\nI like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any\nWe bought this not per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court hears what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important than for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of a terribly polarized political process and environment than we live at\nUm this is not only\nCongress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court well\nI guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers\nGay and lesbian employees just as Kevin other places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts\nSwing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement June you

a way to make it work let me let me ask says ... have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court hears what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we live at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court well I\nGuess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big

the word that the judge used was assimilate she chose was one of them and not really acknowledge the fact that you are you're of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time\nWell they viewed as experts are so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges that you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism
