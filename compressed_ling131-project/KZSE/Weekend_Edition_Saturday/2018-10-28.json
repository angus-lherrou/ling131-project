special coverage from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference and is about to start in Pittsburgh this morning\nEleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it as a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us\nMorning Hi Lou oh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nWell what we know is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well yeah this alleged shooter\nHas been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime well it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nA the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody out the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a it as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene this into context for us so there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil again eleven people killed a rabbinical group that represents\nSince including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades yeah\nAnd we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning\nRight um I went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still\nI'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue of to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun you know laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nAnd and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think a point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were a vigil last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding yeah what are they mention there will\nBe a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um this is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events\nMuseum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place it's\nSo hard to talk to children after something like this happen ... so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so that's just one small thing the communities doing to try to help Stanley's a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a cope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n[laughter]\n\nIncredibly moving and somber\nUm what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nUm something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the synagogue the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks worth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there'd been mass shootings in recent years\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about\nAny racial minority they're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned\nTheir race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default\nSo I have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on\nWhat the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that they're they're white and it was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why put our voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world to something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this is also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist\nMeans we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is that most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things than sit when you're trying to\nDiscuss some of these racial divisions in this country\nWhen I was clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered the election showed that by to be very glaring clear because we were ...\nSaying right ... voted on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt and we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it it's it's economic anxiety so that's biased\n\nYour Twin Cities area forecast for to de partly cloudy skies this morning then becoming mostly Saudi by this afternoon
