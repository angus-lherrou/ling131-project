Carrick who resigned from the College of cardinals earlier this year [noise] these are unsettling time for many\nBernick says the young man who grew up in Pennsylvania in one of Donald worlds diocese and moved to Washington DC this summer he joins us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here tell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has that effect on a lotta people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you know\nIt hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these parishes that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was a thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic\nDid you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to do no I Do not fortunately\nNothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops and people whose names are plastered up on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more\nInterested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area since starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking all of these news stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God\nI still have a face and I just see much less of the connection between my personal faith and the Catholic Church\n... now of Washington DC thanks for speaking with us in just a personal way yeah thank you for having reporters got a rare glimpse

into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we face up to\nThe outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around on a chain she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those beatings just started to get progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to give her aggressively worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the ... the she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you one of the things that I was going to say\nLucian ship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of particular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAnd individually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kinda there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and it was sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like I can just push my body pushing my body pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police I was about to get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept it up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nMan I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about they're harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nThe victim and one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi and so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make we are unable to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about their physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother and not love me enough to instill a practice at\nAn early age and this book in some way is like her investment or coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing to say and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and try to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this\nHeavy than American memoir thanks so much for being with us thank you so much for having

coal of Florida\nIn Georgia a number of civil rights groups are showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up but\nJust over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups or so in Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also they Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere is just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nWhen there's concern about not just conventional vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is it a complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates\nThe voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race estimate\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she says everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy I'm On the other side ... campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis\nBut for both candidates motivating the bases really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not all about who's going to actually show up\nJohnny Kauffman of
