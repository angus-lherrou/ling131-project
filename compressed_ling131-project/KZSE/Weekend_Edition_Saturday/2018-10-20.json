in the case then crown prince Mohammed bin saw him on purged\nTwo of his advisors or wish I had to be linked to the operation President Trump called the Saudis statement credible a good first step\nBut key members of Congress from both sides of the question the Saudi account which is at odds with the Turkish explanation that says it was a Saturday hit team with a bone saw and a plan to kill ... with us this morning NPR's Deborah Amos has covered Saudi Arabia\nProgramming is supported by Mira a new kind of precision pain clinic pinpoints paying at the source dialing down the need for

standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on the senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership failed to confirm his death earlier\nBad news travels slowly to the top is that one Saudi defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince but there are so many questions left to be answered\nOne of the biggest right in front of us whereas Mr ... body indeed\nThe Saudi account says that his body was handed over to a local Turk for disposal Turkish authorities I have been continuing this investigation and now it's in a forest near the you know the consulate\nSo the official account doesn't explain why uh Fifteen man team was sent to stumble or why a sixty year old Jim ... would start a brawl with this large group most of them were half of his age\nYou know those are the names and the ages of the squad has been documented by the New York times and the Washington Post\nAnd the Turks leak those names\nIn the run up to the official account which was made public on Saudi TV early this morning there's been this on line army of Saudis social media botch a it's a smear campaign against because show gee I'm there's another hash tag that says\nOn that began trending on Twitter Twitter is hugely popular in the kingdom and you have to read it to see what's going on internally\nAccording to their question that has to be raised how could

had a muted response so far to the deaths of your mouth to shrug gee\nWe turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership Mr ... thanks so much for being with us to be based on all of your experience just to show the explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise\nOr oh and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a pump tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries\nIt's not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed and in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using\nIn our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo uh thirty seconds we have left a if not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely\nWe can find ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen coffee weeks is unacceptable ...

counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects shows a change in no way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them at the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty Fifteen\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the aid and branch of al Islam\nAnd all those lives that right is a very important political party in Yemen to his longest party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired\nLeader does he only and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had his top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nI guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that\nThere are laws that do govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are numbers on lots of a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... short right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is ... ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend here are are there the only ones who've done this or the other countries who try it's um are there other Americans\nOther than the ones to enter other Americans who believe you've uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm going to keep on looking at it and I've had the honor of interviewing several\nWho are working a secret service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there's several reasons one is a there's a lot of money involved but\nThey also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he's doing U.S policy of us has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we saw them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir arguments they're doing what the you know basically the U.S U.S foreign policy anyway\nI Would say that this is perfect for someone who doesn't want to go for a super serious book just want something

right away scot he pivoted to the contracts\nThe Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and and as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhich means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks or as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given up quickly in the past he has leveled\nVery blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the

Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on its face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince\nCompelled to reporters on his return to the U.S the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have a long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n... is right about that for decades us presidents from both parties have felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly enlist in residence at the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this sort of transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or it have to speak

exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancelled that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies at first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership\nAnd the Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nI think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments a that would have real

appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal to Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for ... but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old introduction continent of high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and links and Mir died on it\nSister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in Georgia snow from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to think so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later\nOn when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nA ... real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we're all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of\nProgramming is supported by Europe a new kind of precision pain clinics that pinpoints paying at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing mirror clinics dot\nCom so\nCentral to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lived and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year\nBecause I Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son in her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for Madigan someday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a\nA video of Matty singing a bonding rate song she's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and not spend a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat Bonnie rich on there
