Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding on a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nBut those people having to make these huge decisions they are not comfortable with hall [noise] WB the Chicago dj this American Life America stay with us [laughter]\nBut [noise]\nJudge to Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nTo drag his decisions down to the wire over and over used undecided than seem like a no when Kavanaugh was yes it was let's wait a week ... made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill is with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story suggests leak changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN\nOut from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview just late fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh ... dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was stuff\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination that he was confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled\nArchie law was one of the two women and that confrontation has had her play good morning or good morning when that elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential there were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced flake raised over thirty thousand dollars and a couple of days lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks\nHas been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed ... mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and maybe this morning that they have any\nWe talked about it wasn't but I Do think there was a\nIt was the thing is not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect\nHim like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault\nIt's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the buildings he was in the middle of the story about Lindsey Graham before women jumped on the elevator with us they were being a hero to shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily then\nSupport what do you believe we wouldn't be where we believe women when you think you can't replace what do you have to say something you can say it went in right now in the survivors\nFled revenues are into this\nYeah are you going to do the right than\nDoes it affect you and people yelling like that [noise]\nBenefits of each of\nThe week making fun of himself talked about before like lots of men his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm not sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a deal like this undecided\nBoth very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just isn't sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today and uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a boat um it's been it's just a head debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that was pretty raw you know [noise]\nNext morning of course freak finally releases the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the head and you've got to come back to\nYou know for some sort of innocence\nEat then to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that flakes he yes\nHe chokes up reportedly says\nAnd then we each make choices for our own reason I'm struggling sorry a lot of tears in the capital those two days the meeting begins\nThe two sides rail against each other fleet stressing gets up and makes a call he probably check Twitter because usually does but\nCouldn't stop the FBI report was a disgrace basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said it was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car\n[noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied with the FBI before do you feel\nBetter now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nA joy of people [laughter] that stuff for several years apart you know\nIs no bipartisan right now there is no idle to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not and\nAs with any one against the family ever [noise]\nVery chase ... has a program that turn out of this recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy\nKennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years the him being questioned into ... back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through all that well I like my own\n\nYou know remember the\nSenate is\nA political body and they have to act in a political way\nThe frame or just knew that\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nI Do think ah\nIt has the obligation or to recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence and integrity of our court\n\nYou should ask is whether the judge has the temperament the commitment\nOf the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge you're going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful\nIsn't it a as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people asking that escape it cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a big talker and explain this job how it works\nWe will meet um just the nine of us and uh and discuss the case\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case it's a one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um\nWe know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it and let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just reverse of our from it's a question that the rationale\nThe principle of\nThe reasons that you'll get and let's say it's five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slapping high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all as we realized one of us will have to write an opinion that commands the\nAllegiance\nOf the American people\nAre an opinion that explains\nThe teachers\nThe principles of war the principles of the constitution or the controls will result\nIn when we issue that opinion

in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions and a one attorney raised his hand and said\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs or how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and I divide them up among the
