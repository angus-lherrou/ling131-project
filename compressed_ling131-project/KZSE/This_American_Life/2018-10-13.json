first drill in the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around it's a district in rural Ohio there's that his record on the condition that we not say their name on the air\nIt eight people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians do administrators who run school one of them is the only woman in the team vicious pollock watched them doing this at least a so I'm explain how this works exactly\nSo the seven guns or lack in these small safe that have been installed in locations out at the school I saw the ride a bunch of drought and then all of them the goal was to render their safe get the guys out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible\nAnd they time each drought okay we're going to pay for this one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks that fire during these drills so the first little glitch steaks\nActually had trouble getting into the ... you had to put your finger on the sensor or do\nAnd a little tricky\n\n[noise]\nWell there's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shoot [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's the principal for grade six to twelve and he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria he's got a gun he's wearing a bulletproof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and\nOne of these shootings another kid getting killed not enough of this way [noise]\n\nElementary awareness and the elementary when [noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway and he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there is a door there and it's locked this happens automatically one of the school goes into locked down\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nStarted driving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nGeorgia or shall we go we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything but just timing the response and it wasn't great\nWas the ... the first yeah oh yeah\nThey said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nI I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own and and\nSo I wanted to learn [noise] so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss\nI Can't miss because if I miss there's a possibility if somebody else getting her\nMind and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts\nOf course he might have to shoot one of his students and a lot of these shootings that's who the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed but these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nAnd\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday in our program we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it'll pass to just pay the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish the shooter gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nAt one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to where people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nWB easy Chicago it's this American Life America last\n[noise] [noise]\n... Edwin ready as you'll never be\nPretty sure that's trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen there is an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total over how the schools emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training I don't think they kind of thing\nKnew what to do we knew what to do\nEven still even with that and we still had\nCats if you have people that aren't going to return to their families\nDid the training they received to save lives that day or didn't it such an open question when our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies

training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nDishes what we do for ... for every period for every dish is what a code black is this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were ... silver day they would get it on a burgundy day school\nColors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nMelissa says her kids to the drill seriously\nSay we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in their classroom doors of paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see\nIn that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do actually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not losing her cool what she did\nShe knew it was real [noise] [noise] [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted

grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gun shot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not\nLeave and be like

S. government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed and Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control event he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration in on it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy stopped dead broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNotice truth ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave\nInterviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved demanding was threatening him ended up in jail cell hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is Warren parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh Mm Mm Mm\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting\nAgain the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse friend called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was [noise]\n[noise] screaming just\n[noise] horrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting site what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and took to never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night and other Seventy people\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked if they'd be\nSandy said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces and he said that's what we looked like five months ago\nThat looked like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying to show their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving but they're not really there\nI realized that's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nWanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back\nSandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the Philips has said there was also a strong and in some sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia attack\nIn Tucson these parents had lots of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe [noise]\nThe filters now had parents that they can lean on to this was the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people it's happened to help them fight each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to ...\nYou live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on which they want you to get back to normal light ... rather should they should you know same as you were shouldn't you know let me explain something you're right I'm not the same person on there will be they should as we're obsessed with ... well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople who were closest to disappear which makes this informal support groups even more crucial [noise] [noise]\nWhat's that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland on a kitten that store at and let them at their house their son's name was Nick he was the captain of Parkland swim team\nWas about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitt said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about

he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and other set a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who match next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in and gets Nick calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was telling you you have any comments can we have

their names were called out even walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like\nWe we couldn't even find your son and you know and I hope that he was somewhere else and I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house\nAnd then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot
