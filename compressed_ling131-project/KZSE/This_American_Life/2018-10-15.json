S. government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed and Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Phillip says ran into him face to face and a gun control than he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life in your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration in on it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of him it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy stepped in broken up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth there's are hookers troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get\nThe FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hoaxes or one of the things the Philips has learned parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nMhm mhm Mm\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hours\nSandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone there was [noise]\n[noise] screaming just\n[noise] horrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse collie and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nThose when I woke up because the screen was slowed it was so horrific and something I've never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their couch really held her\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after ... died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says\nThey felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into us\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces and he said that's what we look like five months ago\nThat looked like\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying to show their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nBut the Philips has said there was also a strong and in some sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia attack\nIn Tucson these parents had lots of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe [noise]\nThe filters now had parents that they can lean on to this is the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids photos to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal my own brother should they should you not
