friends your family your neighbors your co workers did vote for Republicans\nThere are less than four weeks until election day and polls show voter enthusiasm is high but of history as a guide most Americans won't vote in the mid term [noise] even when they're eligible one of the main reasons why I haven't voted is because I feel that I'm always too busy being\nAway from home but also connected to the political system I don't believe that it actually affect us\nToday we're going to look at who isn't voting why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR's to medical mountain RO and off Mulholland hey guys hey there hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority will not vote right and that's\nThe whole thing is between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their basis because they need to get the most activist people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut ... why are they voting the it's complicated right like some of it is because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system is rigged I mean I could go on and on it's like there's so many reasons but those are kind of some of the big ones I mean a big part of it also is there is some people who actually just obstructed from the\nProgramming is supported by near or a new kind of precision pain clinic pinpoints paying at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing mirror clinics dot com\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerge and that's what I'm Wondering are I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for the audience\nSure sure I mean still the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundits talk about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it's even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a writer on the Las Vegas strip\nAnd why went there in particular was it had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen\nAnd is it Eighteen to twenty five an hour and a twenty nine year old is how the oh wow that's not even that young and and there was a young guy I met his name is ... he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd you know he basically was very confused with the system he initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nI've never voted before Moore has a from what all I Know about voting is on your show to poll place and you hope I don't know what I Need to bring on an even know what happens during or\nBring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think to him like\nHe wasn't the only person who expressed this confusion with how you vote which I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkie this is\nSort of things that we assume people knew but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy Eighteen\nTo twenty nine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up votes\nVoters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rates and they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections in mid term elections in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year olds Nineteen percent\nThat dropped off to Thirteen percent twenty fourteen than spike back up to Nineteen percent during the presidential election in twenty sixteen\nWhy is that I feel like I've heard a couple of big theories one being that a lot of young people are very transient so they don't feel attached to that particular place that they live in and she'll be maybe it's actually mentioned this to me he's originally from Missouri he thinks he registered they originally so he doesn't really feel attached\nTo Nevada and he felt like you didn't know much about Nevada politics and this is something that I Would say we hear a lot about the other big thing I've heard a lot from young people about its transportation and just sort of the logistics of trying to get to the polls and they may not be stakeholders either younger voters\nAnd that they don't have kids in the schools like ... there are things that happen later in your life they get you more engaged in politics even at just at the local law but there's also this belief that they don't think that they know enough which I Wonder if the if this is a factor of just being young when you look at surveys you'll see a large percentage of young people say that they don't think they know enough\nTo be able to vote and so therefore they don't want to cast a ballot for someone if they don't actually know who this person is and I've heard that by just knocking on doors and talking to young folks as well\nAnd yet what's fascinating is if you look at millennials which are on on on a whole older than just Eighteen to twenty nine there are there are about twenty to thirty seven people born between Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen Ninety six is how few defines\nMillennials millennials for the first time in twenty eight teams are going to be the largest voting bloc by generation\nSo Osman who else is unlikely to vote so what is the biggest determining factor as of whether you're a voter not a voter is your income and your education level in fact I'm some experts that I spoke to say that that\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from a larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the law that they could

every week through the mid term elections we're going to be here with a special broadcast breaking down the issues on voters' minds\nAnd the history of our church\nRepublicans once thought them major tax cut they passed would be their best selling point headed into the mid term but\nThink voters are on their side on this issue\nIt's an all out looting of America the wholesale robbery of the middle class\nWe're going to dig into the policy of a big tax law and how that's affecting the politics to do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered this more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys how are ya\nSo Kelsey you cover Congress um they passed this thing let's talk about what was in it can you give us a quick recap of what was in this big tax bill\nYeah the big things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent a Twenty one percent\nThey also made things a little bit simpler for individuals they made the standard deduction almost double they cut rates for most people who pay taxes and they doubled the child tax credit\nBut they also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction it's that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments they conduct that well they were Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill in check and\nThey put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write some of that off\nThat is also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread on evenly across people with different income brackets\nJust got this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nTo say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing\nBust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month those are pretty healthy growth numbers\nPrivate economists and the CDO forecasters they think this is a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that's the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional\nYeah they're the nonpartisan official score keepers for all ... all the bills that goes through Congress to deal with tax isn't it\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House thing no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings\nPut that into new plants new equipment new machinery that's going to make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one so basically\nWe're going to go into the midterm elections where people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not as hot matter of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nNo the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days the recession it was kinda high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the deficit is expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nYou do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing\nThe taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to use and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means the government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats is they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to raise people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed also campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for this tax bill for months and months and the polling average that they use of aren't real clear politics shows than thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five\nPercent disapproved\nAnd you know the tax credit had kind of a a momentary high water mark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers\nAre and and for a nanosecond the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval\nBut that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now trading right around where President Trump is forty percent or lower and that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut is that where it's going to be a as we approach the midterm elections they would be disappointed no that's where it wound up\nIs the tax bill becoming sort of a non issue\nAgain Democrats are going to continue messing ... messaging tax cuts as the binary to win the no Republicans wanting to cut other things that Democrats like like health care like Social Security like Medicare\nThey will continue to message it that way and you know Republicans may be hoping that this starts to bear fruit\nBut maybe twenty twenty I think you're going to continue to hear competing narratives Republicans will talk about this\nAs an investment in the health of the U.S economy that will pay for that will pay dividends in the long term Democrats will talk about it as a deficit ballooning give away to the rich that's going to put the squeeze on entitlement programs are the folks depend on", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Planet Money, How I
