their corners Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat or Republican vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gaps on this for example when you ask independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote your fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divide then you see among Republicans or Democrats likewise when they say okay so how's Trump going to affect your vote\nFifty percent of independent women say more likely to make me vote for a Democrat thirty three percent of independent men say that\nSo when we talk about gender divide and this is important this year\nYes women are a driving factor we do have the potential this year across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's also about party democratic men and democratic women alike disliked Trump and are going to vote Democrat\nYeah I mean when Daniel talks but independents they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked about and the gamble here among Republicans in a lot of Republicans I talked to was they said look independents young voters Latinos\nYou know they don't turn out to vote as much in mid term you're so you know if the goal is to drive up the base and this was going to be a base\nThen they need to fire up the Republican base with a lot of these cultural issues as we read the

from one vote the final votes\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ... H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learned more ed E. H. R. go dot com\nKurtzleben guys hey Hi so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the health care as their best issue with voters\nWhich is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned bare minimum but if you're a Democrat you're much more worry I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are worried about the healthcare system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire midterm cycle then Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for affordable accessible health care and not take it away\nLike three hundred thousand North Dakota and he has a preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now this is Patrick Morsi's losses to take away health here from people with preexisting conditions\nAnd what Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily wiggling away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years and\nIt's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have had\nPortable care accurate try to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ads come down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with actions taken by the Trump Administration Scott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people are but could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of\nBeen an attack on the a C a insurance marketplace which despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that passed and how the Senate bill that didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOf the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that representative so unsettled voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace failed that they'll what has done away with your protections for pre existing\nOr defending themselves from these attacks in an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nThat's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will correct wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions including the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year I'm a democratic ads yes Scott said more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks these things here and building Democrats feel this year that's compared to\nFrom twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nIs the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act two of those state attorneys general happened to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia\nJosh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying\nOh I definitely would protect people with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act\nThis year we learned our oldest has a rare chronic disease preexisting conditions we know what that's like I'm just calling I support forcing insurance\nWell that is a statement that you could argue is very much at odds with the lawsuit that he is a part of to unwind the Affordable CARE Act if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow here in the studio with NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben talking about health care\nSo what is the basis of all of this a focus on health care I mean do people care more about healthcare now than they did two years ago or four\nYears ago one is that Obamacare is somewhat more popular now than it was back during a lot of the Obama administration um if you look at polling data from say twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen Obamacare was generally seen net unfavorably more people seeing it on favorably than favorably", "show_name": "Planet Money, How I Built This", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "27"}
