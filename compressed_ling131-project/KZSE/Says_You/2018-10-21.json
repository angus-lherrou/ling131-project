joking but I promise that will be fun\nBut ... and by north ... at the Boston Globe welcome back to you both next severe thank you Karen [noise]\nSo I don't normally follow the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but this week our friend Patrick ... treated out an interesting report and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits and football would have been ranked number one for a psycho social benefits if not for the fact that football players are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors like\nExcessive drinking but that to me seems like a a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be attracted to the risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids who are attracted to the dangers of football and\nI'm all questions and no answers and ... what do you think\nSo first of all my perspective on football is that kids don't need to play it in high school high school football scares me a ... just because all the research shows that when your brain as younger starts when it's the most vulnerable and the thing that I thought looking at the study was just that\nThe psycho social benefit seemed more related to playing a team sport mhm than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought well yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends\nWell I I don't know if I have an issue of high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner ... yeah really little kids but I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big\nSupport for NPR's brought you a law firm of ... intellectual property group with offices in

it on the field as one\nIf you play high school basketball the gym maybe empty if you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that run across country but football\nI can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been just suggest that kids under fourteen just plays flag football instead that they don't really need to tackle ... yeah\nAnd I'm totally ... yeah yeah yeah and you know Tom rainy and the Manning's none of them play tackle football until they they were a little bit older\nBut what was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need high school football flag football like would would that would that community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for are risky behavior [laughter]\nI'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do Michael a basketball we need some basketball help us out [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution paid\nThe that the G League is a now offer an alternative to the in sees one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have a leap prospects from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft to come\nTwenty five thousand dollars a year you choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for WNBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness everybody signed with an agent\nBut there is a risk to this one being you're playing in the ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself from your perspective as you say in college when you're playing against guys are on age\nAlso the G League does not provide the platform that a billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players but just allowing them to have the ability of the hiring agent to sell their likeness and assign shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the ... sort of one day waking up and deciding like oh we're going to do the right thing they're\nCool that sad probably the best possible outcome from this right or at least as I see it would be that the threat of\nElite high school players going to the ... league instead of being one and diamonds would be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because they just feel like it [laughter] I mean I think the only way it works and this seems like a an uphill battle is that is\nThe alternative is a good enough one that can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of light which would be the first time that there's an alternative that's been able to do that\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G League into those top spots then I think it works\nThe un P. A. issue so I'm going to hold you to that WNBA players get paid less than these Taft high schoolers would\nI didn't immediately make that connection like\nHey this is really prove that something is a little off here and it really shows how ingrained this idea is that men male athletes should always get paid more than female athletes\nAnd no one is suggesting that WNBA players should get paid as much as NBA players you know what I Do you know the bird has said that there's a bias that exists here and I really think the idea of\nMinor league players and a leader that hasn't even like they don't they're not even on to not only ... and\nAnd the fact that they would\nMaybe Maureen as a better television do you eat\nRight right I mean if we need a stronger indication that there is a bias I don't think we'd find one a minute [laughter]\nI totally agree\nI I think it's really unfair Dennis Ross is my favorite basketball player like male or female like I Love seeing her play and then you have this deal that sort of like a slap in the face of sort of reminds you that yeah in this country we we reward mill um athletes much more significantly than we do females\nWell we ... I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WMBA is significantly lower than eight to twenty five percent right and center ... sort of ... percent\nSo as it is only a game tradition we save our most important topic for last nor\nDo you yeah I think this is going to mark the end of my tenure as the Boston Globe patriots supporter because I'm sure that I Am just today is from a column for the spotlight investigative team I wrote a piece recently about touchdown and big place celebrations\nAnd it was kind of a something that the NFL has been letting players do a little bit more I Love when guys get really creative\nIn in the patriots locker room and pulled a bunch of guys to come up with kind of a grading system ah her how to look at a celebration and decide if it's up to snuff and I have a confession for you guys because\nWhat all the patriots players sad was that you just can't celebrate when you're losing and this that actually happened during the cold got an interception a couple of weeks ago in a game and they were down by two scores\nAnd they started celebrating it during this day and there was the end zone cameras got them and obviously on TV you see the score right below and you're like ooh guys rough\nAnd I'm going around and they're all saying well you can't I mean you can't celebrate when you're losing and I'm thinking in the back of my mind and this is why I'm not a professional athlete but can't [laughter] I don't know how much you're losing [laughter] I just believe in everybody's right to hype them\nUp I support that as well and like if you pick up Tom Brady you said you know let everybody know yet picked on me stone but if you're getting your butt kicked you just look kind of silly\nThinks you're listening to MPR news now there are new ways to keep in touch with the regional national and international news you rely on if you have a smart speaker you can listen to the station was simple command if you have a lack of that just add NPR News to your skills and then save open\nNPR News on Google Home all you have to do is use the command played Minnesota Public radio news [noise] All right Here's NPR news [noise]\nKeep in touch with NPR News\nDiscovering what matters next time on studio three sixty\n[noise] over sixty years who we're Harlan Ellison wrote countless ... short stories novel\nA huge output if I were a plumber and you said how many toilets of effects and I said in thousand you wouldn't say boy what a prolific plumber seem I suppose that I'm a writer delete Harlan Ellison next time on studio three sixty [noise]\nSeems like a nice night to dive into the world is speculative fiction you'll hear that topic coming up during tonight studio three sixty which comes your way next after news at ten o'clock right here at Minnesota Public radio news\nSo glad you're spending your weekend with us hope you are having a fine uh Saturday evening reminder later on tonight or coming up at eleven o'clock we joined the b._b._c.
