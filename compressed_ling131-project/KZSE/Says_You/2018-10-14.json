that\nDid you on cork champagne or was it\nWas like cracker jacks wine in the ... um no but I think you know I was super invested in in the LDS as I think a lot of people were because\nYou know Yankees Red Sox first time meeting the postseason since two thousand four when I was also really invested but what was interesting to me about the series is that I went into it assuming that every with than would be jazz for the rivalry\nAnd yet when I went to Fenway and Yankee Stadium also I found that fans weren't as dedicated to hating the other team as I expected them to be\nDo you think that part of the issue I mean besides the fact that the dragon was slain for but also the red Sox and the Yankees these current teams are kinda likeable didn't have enough jerks the red Sox Yankees they need more jerk for that rivalry to be really if\nThey know Jason that's exactly what people said at Fenway they were like we don't have the same characters you know there's there's not a lot not to like\nAaron\nStill not\nGoing in the locker room and I get yelled at by Yankees PR are trying to talk to them and judges like sorry like he was very nice about it\nAll right Jason what do you think I think the Houston Astros fares are going around dogs or it's just\nSo annoyed that they had to play all their games I Wonder where they play their games or eight in the morning for the red socks on the Yankees are playing prime\nTime the actors are just fed up with all those east coast media bias so speaking of east coast media\nBecause of this panel which is we are three Red Sox fans right\nI mean Jason doesn't care about anything to do here and I said in a free title last year that I was wearing Red Sox Jersey so it's just throwing it out and I wanted to have roosters [laughter]\nI'm not even going to pretend Karen I'm I'm a Homer\nBut Jason what you just said about being said is exactly my thoughts I keep hearing people say and this is crazy to me like oh the red Sox are playing a lot better than they have recently like their new and I'm like why are you talking about like we don't actually need another championship\nWhere a lot of never satisfied Karen hadn't the game I go you realize\nCare and that there are six year olds in New England who have only been one duck but Red Sox slightly more if I was just it's it may have waited long enough\nOf the children All right so I

played brilliantly during practice well screaming things like you bleeping need me and other things I Can't see on the radio and then he sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols\nWhat is the right way to do it no I Can't control them when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game as wrong me me and my fires numerous sure that's what you're going to do inside the lines\nI was gonna say is it not the right way for it to come out and do you think it was the wrong thing to do with oh no kidding to do I think that\nI was on okay let's try that again yes yes it was the wrong thing to do

concerned\nAbout very worried about my reputation look I think that what athletes are very good at these days is owning a news cycle Jimmy Butler knew exactly what he was doing and the report about his practice came out and two hours later he was on the jump with Rachel\nI don't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more airtime isn't necessarily going to be like a role model issue I Do think that if I were his teammates it'd be like\nMan but I I think that it's all pretty calculated\nCharlotte's so cynical you think the fact that ESPN was on ... campus for this melt down with advanced warning was somehow a bit of choreography or team he bought

most WNBA stars where men signatures shoes what kids but now it's time for the week's news with Charlie Pierce Hi Charlie\nHold your women you all want to talk about issues of shoes Philadelphia\nSeventy Sixers centered July al ... has signed a five year deal with Under Armour\nIt'll make in the highest compensated player at his position and he told ESPN quote there's a stereotype about big men that we can't sell shoes is that because she's look really weird and aside Seventeen\nYes I'm speaking as someone who bought\nAt a charity auction an autograph Shaquille O'Neal show out on yeah which I Believe we're using his car for [laughter] the problem with with that they looked fine on the big man right but when you put them on a shelf\nThey looked like art auctions [laughter] but if anybody can do it it's Joelle envied who has charisma beyond belief um so I mean he's going to make a lot of money at this and he says he's not really a center anyway he thinks of itself a guard I mean he might think of his own the Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this is the way the world is yeah\nI mean he said I'm not really a big man and of course he's certainly big he's seven feet tall but\nHe says he can do at all which I guess means\nPhiladelphia Seventy Sixers are just had a stroke [laughter]\nThe college basketball corruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shock shocks you\nYes what shocked me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the enforcement arm of the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bride big enough to make me care about this bribery trial it's re criminalizing an underground economy the whole thing is just silly the players are the ones who are going to get hurt most and the NC double a which was on the ropes and staggering has now found its way back\nTo what it perceives to be the moral high ground and I couldn't be more disgusted\nSpeaking of the players are the ones that get hurt the New York times brought up an interesting question this week and that's who's the real victim here the prosecutors say the victim is the university's\nFans might say at us but the New York times suggests that it's Bryan tags Boeing whose father agreed to take money from Adidas and as a result tags is now playing in Australia\nWell there's nothing wrong with playing in Australia has a really nice place but it's also not national television\nYou know I think Brian Bull is going to be fine I think he's going to do as a friendship in Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high\nBut again the fact remains is this this whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized by these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's haven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on this show we learned that the woman who is accusing event is star Christiana ... of rape had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document in which run although admitted to non consensual sex\nNow or no lawyer is saying that document was acquired in a computer hacking altered so now\nWhy didn't go to law school I think certainly burden of proof is on ... on his lawyers to prove that thing was hacked that sounds like a very expeditious discovery all of a sudden\nOtherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge it All right because it's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr ... who is capable of buying a lot of forensics\nYou've written a lot and your other jobs about the nature of truth and how hard it is to figure out what is true and when people start calling into question legal documents I really get confused\nWhat can we ... well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about it than you do so I mean it's a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I mean I guess you just have to trust your instinct and understand that the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans and Chelsea has decided that just banning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things\nInstead they're gonna get offenders the opportunity to quote spends time with our diversity officers understanding what you did wrong and this time isn't going to be spent in a classroom\nRight oh they're going to take them to Auschwitz which I Will guarantee you most of these people will not connect with the black people their insulting it's a good idea\nYou know maybe they should all get on an airplane and go to the new anti lynching memorial down in Alabama that Brian Stevenson slice put up I like inventive thinking on this sort of thing go on a road trip and go see what the end result of what you're doing it\nAnd finally Charlie I'm just going to let you explain what was mysterious about the guy wearing number Thirteen when Hawaii face Wyoming last Saturday Night\nHe wasn't [laughter]\nThey're worried about it'd be Wyoming by the way in his game Seventeen to Thirteen but they're starting quarterback Colin McDonald he had
