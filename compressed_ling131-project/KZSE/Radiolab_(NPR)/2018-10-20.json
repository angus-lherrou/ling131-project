I'm Robert Krulwich\nStory about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we must but we ... it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to mention one on it yeah\nAnyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand eight George how bout with a song yes please check\n[noise] [laughter]\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning a that this group of young to middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you there\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering\nStephanie newer and what what are you calling from St Louis nursing\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would uploads those photos to Facebook in these pictures\nWould receive a warning from Facebook for uploading um pornographic content\nAnd people were really getting their backs up over this [noise]\nThey want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period\n[laughter]\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook one\nOf the opening shots Facebook triggered hordes\nNow in what would become a loud Facebook do Facebook rockets\nIn global battle embattled Facebook CEOs today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nAny violence against roe kingdom muscle what we can say in what we can't say it again by this iconic photograph what we\nCan see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn the Internet\nThank you Mr Chairman Mr sack of arc I got to\nDo you subjectively prioritize or sensors speech\nCongresswoman we don't and drove over during a censoring speech but there are types\nWhat what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text documents that dictates what\nWhat you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital document it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and die\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow [laughter] which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\n[laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was the Google Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to what you just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees one on one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind\nThis was in the early to thousands seismic change in this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path nice face time is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we\nThan my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of confidence like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer\n... to Facebook and\nOn Lake meaning like I use their saw something that I thought was wrong exactly\nLike a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise]\nThat content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear\nReason why someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd every time something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\n[laughter] rise up fight for the rights that rather than\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday\nToo much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with alive protest they just you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group have Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on the social networking website is under fire for installing the unfolding of women renovating their children taught him twelve thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring in diseases are going to have sent by sitting\nIn that I did hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine New York times Washington\nPost Soviet are now using the interesting\nDr phil it was a media storm and eventually perhaps as a result of our group and our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by the nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just say no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nThere to try to talk to some of these people to for a living they did a computer and collectively quick through around two million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow what we were I'm just curious like what's what's that like\n[noise] well I'm\nSome question\nPretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting leaving me happening\nAnd not a third of all the good work advice [laughter] but now I Am I thirty buddies you know I'm Sorry\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in the lichen NDA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that is totally fine you know I was going to end victory I don't want to take up here\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nLike a tax credit and you talk about what I ... watch\nBlind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYou know I I like I got to monitor graphic images\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you got your so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his head phones [laughter]\nIgnore ...\n...

humanity you see all of this stuff\nThat you and I don't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and and it's worth noting that are more and more this work
