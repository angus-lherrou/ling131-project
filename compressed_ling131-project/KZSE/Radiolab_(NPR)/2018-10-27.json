I'm Robert Krulwich uses radio lab and today we have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um let my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbia school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she said that I'm not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us the story and under whose skin or he also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSearching Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist one newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nAnd the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside rode out through thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up too tense and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM ... campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a butter knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen uh of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook them into the woods near brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun Adam and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied\nHe went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him\nHappening with the man stabbing them ... with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times in the chest and when this happened three of them\nAnd and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had um lay down in a ditch next to\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess still Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter then our men come men that the other campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than the killer and Friedman\nLaying down in the ... when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd then enter the gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly and Cooley walked into the forest and us began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nThere was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate when it comes back with an ID eight\nSeven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife and\nThe story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when the people got panicked when you're all well one of the doors are locked people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nPeople left the area so fast that unfair that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers so as a man has dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen a car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted Guerra\nThese a freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and Guerra started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm and the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but they you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put 'em in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing\nBut you wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that it's so fascinating about this case this is a law professor Lisa ... is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyers should do and what a good person should do in the situation and we are recording\nAnd so the guy at the center of this conflict\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ... H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learned more at E. H. R. go dot com\nMonday a couple of months ago producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights I'd like standing up for the gun and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting the state and tyranny\nAnd he was doing really well he has well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert Guerra\nYeah life you're strong to take him out you need a forty five and a juice had the feeling that this guy is dangers a love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things wind\nTold the lawyers that Susan pets\nOf a closed up mine\nShaft the mind is up in mind though\nAbout an hour south of the hospital a\nBurden had around ... and in that moment were you scared were you excited like oh you you're up high it's high but you're scared you're concerned yes fear your food if you don't\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one bar where wind up France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nThere about thirty minutes spelled you talked to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door took up\nDriving the lady friends car to try to lose any details\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this\nMay be as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine\n[noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren ... street and the town supervisor of Mariah Tom's cause a father says it's on a road that goes to the minute or what have you have to them on it was that sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just very icy that day the share this used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly speech there were no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm very skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and it's just the only way they could've came in here so\nThat so here we are in our Sunday suits\nFours looking for [noise]\nSpent lovable worse look [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nWe found this was her ...\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for this has given me such yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak shoe a blue sneaker\n[noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself this number which does it end he yells back up to a Belgian get me out of your\nMoney back up they\n... found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where narrow headset he left her\nBut our money wasn't there when ... founder so what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options sure so option what we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these er\nNo you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just can't we took you know to keep your confidences over ... under the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be the the ... that can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there is no if if if people are already dead then you ... the the lawyers shoe\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nOf ... or also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the
