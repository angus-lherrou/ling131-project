{"month": "10", "state": "MN", "station": "KZSE", "content": "Into the afternoon hours on Sunday with the clouds eyes and the low fifties northeast wins five to ten rain likely Sunday evening lows overnight in the mid forties [noise]\nI'm Catherine richer part of the NPR needs team based in greater Minnesota from Rochester in Morehead we report on the economy the environment and the people across NPR nice discovering what matters\nWe start today's episode we want you to know this broadcast contains tape it\nWe'd be but uh there's descriptions that may not be suitable for young children or sensitive listeners so please be forewarned way you're\n\nListening to radio lab\nRadio from W. N. Y. [noise]\nHey I'm ... and Robert Krulwich radiolab today to [noise] they're gonna start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something\nHigh [laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's a good thing where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started to the game is what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national story [noise] there was a lot of belly aching and press how many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire near rice and Harris than about John Ritter and will become sort of a national story [noise]\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself\nLevel however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police\nShot somebody now there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is complete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBrazil burst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and so we got from Ben sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nI think is three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now\nThis involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing\nThen put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know for sure that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many accidents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages so I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall we've got um broken down by county but you can see uh\nBooker aton Boynton Beach uh all the way through the off about\nA basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represents a eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida in the in in six years time two thousand nine to us from fourteen\nSo he did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team [noise] didn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons and some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they've steady but a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case\nWe also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see\nOur that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's ... I'm going to kill myself but I'm gonna make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot as an attempt to incite the shooting that is right this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThey're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto frontline and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern cells much right now but the breakdown between fake Talib these for their same demographics and as we've that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resist\nTwo years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but some further down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six kind of ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the proper\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to where\nWe were in why we want to start this methane gas still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know I mean they're all written in this uh\nSupplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler receive a call ... to Cato sterile police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife at a party to fight it off every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nSo we have on this table that the investigation of the deaths\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nPeople\n\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nThen if I'm having to ... brown somebody\nThe region out wherever I told them I mean some of them and then you know here's what\nFamily more than just\nSylvie by and I wouldn't be doing anything\n[noise]\nSo after the event ended up the community center crystal took a bunch of the Mondale got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or for no just wanted to know this one's and has been telling everyone about then\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nThough no we didn't know anything about this but it it must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find a way it was a crystal gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age at certain point I was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really I go through my house she says the stage comes down\nYou know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House\n[noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories stories increase of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\nHave you been exported all gone out dancing together [noise]\n... summer's wildfire [noise]\n\nAnd now we're redoing that I'm getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over it and how\nWe sleep in each other head on the couch you know the mattress is it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the corn asleep for talking you know getting to know each other a lot of ... vice over his shoulder so it's like therapy for us\nVicky is let me past but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe we're at ... ... to ... when was the lead some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nSo we usually the video that just came out on video that's the same time off\nMy house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we called extradition a vegetable garden has the guardian was here in\nThat that I Am then 'cause I'm when a when you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back here it's all you can smell was ...\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from the ...
