Judy rom it is to figure out how to grow again\nThis is a pricey batch thirty four billion dollars for red hat is sixty three percent more than what the market thought the company was worth on friday I'm Scott Tong for marketplace as I said speaking of markets Wall Street was lousy today not as lousy as it could have been though will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\nHere's a story about getting what you pay for or more accurately getting what you don't\nPay for you don't have to spend a lot of time driving around almost anywhere in this country to know that our infrastructure our roads specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even improve those roads comes from gas taxes California is one of several states that increased it gas tax not too long ago to get more money\nTo make more repairs but as often happens when your taxes not everybody is happy about 'em and they have taken to the ballot with the anti tax proposition six coming to California voters a week from tomorrow but as much Jed Kim reports now from the streets of LA changes in what kinds of cars run the road might make a real gas tax difference\n... men has brought me to the corner of Venice in Figaro in downtown LA it's next to the convention center staple center\nI Would highway highway yeah the one where I can hear the noises coming through um [noise]\nLipman is with the transportation organization called LA\nHe's against proposition six because he says the gas tax is necessary points out the ... in the ...\nGot a big fire a couple of big titles here [noise]\nLipman says the state has a backlog of a hundred thirty billion dollars in infrastructure investment\nRoads that are less safe bridges that are less safe\nAnd we ... heart investing in the states and the way that we need [noise]\nLast year California legislators decided to patch that hundred thirty billion dollar hole\nBy raising the state's tax on gasoline from Eighteen cents a gallon to thirty cents\nAlmost immediately a group formed to put forward proposition six to overturn the increase and require all future hikes to be approved by voters rather than legislators\nCalled the ... is chairman of the yes on prop six campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement\nThe politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money so we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it\nBut even if the gas tax word stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these types of having been indexed to inflation\nAnother reason can be seen directly across that street\nIn downtown LA at a Honda dealership\nIts windows advertise hybrids another fuel efficient cars\nKrista Ghouta is out on the law joking with other salesmen\nI ask him how many people come in looking for good mileage most of it die\nTouch them and I have I mean for the egg gathered makes you feel worse they looking for a baby guests\nAnd they're fighting it some vehicles top out at over fifty miles to the gallon\nFor people maybe had to buy you know five gallon of gas to go a hundred miles now maybe they got by gallons of gas\nGee league a coaching staff as they get ready for ... for ... yeah ... that South bay Lakers is our team um that we use to develop our draft picks\nWeren't drafted I'll take you in here to the war weren't room because more than ... says take where the draft is how\nYou know ... or one two three four at least four or five like Ninety edge television screens which are showing basketball or ESPN of course I'm with this and you can or the best guess is would you regret\nThe way that the the building is designed is the the the basketball courts are at the center of the building and when you know when you hear the basketball's it's kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if ... you know we are one of the players\nSo you're waiting rooms with the training rooms right of course are over there the beautiful weight rooms and joke so this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the place where the rubber meets the road um so what keeps you up at night but what's your worst [laughter]\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us and and be part of what we're building and\nWe've missed the playoffs every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to it in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that\nI I don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view in la brown and Luke Walton you're coaching and Magic Johnson drug for basketball and you know Kobe in and the other best brokerage of you guys have the conversation on yourself about

general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball was that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting because liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we've had three coaches and three years you know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right\nAnd we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are more complex all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business here don't do so too does the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose forced to read an surgery was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground losing the oh yeah whom I loved it like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I ask him how long is it going to take you to get\nThe team on track and he gave himself a timeline which as as time went on I realized that wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids\nIt's the last\n... hear about your family right I mean Dr bus or to your brother who worked with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book where we've talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial read closer and says don't blow it with a family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nIt was very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kind of set it up for us\nBut ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant she said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what your doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in your question about it out and making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because perhaps I did wait too long\nUm as you can hear the music or early ... it's it's funny because we actually have a DJ now on staff I Know because yeah it's like these young players they there must have multitasking there used to having music while they're doing whatever let me show\nInto and I wonder is good you know you're a ...\nAh one I mean actually this is the

released a devastating report today documenting the censorship of conservative speech by silicon valley's tolerant tech giants\nAnd especially sort of Twitter and Facebook being accused of bias against conservatives and gab sort of came out of that controversy was started by\nA conservative programmer in Silicon valley who was sort of set up with what he saw as excessive political correctness so he started this website and as a result of the fact that it had very few rules there were no rules against hate speech they weren't doing a ton of\nOf censorship is pretty much anything goes a lot of the more prominent people who joined where people who had been kicked off of other platforms lever being too extreme and all of these people\nFlocked there because gab would allow them

of his post they've been taken down but we have an archive none of them\nAnd going through them it's sort of gives you the impression that he was obsessed with anti Semitism I mean substantially all of the posts that he posted and re posted were about Jews were about conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the world\nHe was critical of President Trump\nBecause he thought that President Trump was too accommodating of ...\nSo this was powers Kevin really making use of gab as it was designed to be used as a far more lenient platform than Twitter then Facebook well right\nBefore this shooting we had another act of domestic terrorism which was this male bombing bomb set through the mail to prominent Democrats and news organizations like CNN and the suspect in that case this guy from Florida Caesar say Iraq\nHe also use social media to post sort of extreme and divisive content\nBut he didn't in a different way he was using Facebook and Twitter which are kind of the big mainstream platforms\nAnd he was using them to get into fights and attack people and engage people who he disagreed with and that was sort of the appeal of that service to him was that everyone was there and you can find his enemies and communicate directly with them\nWhereas Robert Bowers seems to have flocked to gab\nWe're the people who agreed with similar and that was where he could find a community of people who shared his views who he could communicate openly with without sort of the watchful eye of the platform getting in the way\nKevin you and I have talked about the fact that social media sites like Facebook and Twitter need to be stronger about policing this sort of speech that we're talking about\nBut I Wonder if your concern that what we're seeing here with gab might be a consequence of that that any crackdown at all has pushed people with more extreme views\nOn to a smaller and less public and more fringe the social media sites where inevitably there's less oversight and also more people who hold equally extreme or more extreme perspectives and is that a problematic outcome\nWell I think one thing that we do know for sure is that when people get kicked off of Twitter and Facebook and other large social media platforms they don't just stop posting they don't go away\nThey find someplace else that will tolerate them more turn a blind eye\nAnd I think we have to get comfortable with the reality that one of the trade offs of having ... our biggest and most influential social platforms be healthier and less toxic is that a lot of the worst stuff is going to get pushed into the smaller\nMore private enclaves and there might not be any way to avoid that even if it shuts down even if something else takes its place\nKevin what have you been thinking as you've
