It's Tuesday October seconds good to have you with us before we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders\nHe called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop bay those act\nAs in Amazon's CEO\nThe tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing which is reportedly true in some states of Amazon\nThe idea is to encourage those employers to pay higher wages well Amazon announced today that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this\nShe's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program thanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour waiting kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nSo Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by this\nThey specifically mentioned part time and temporary workers are they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States is about ... about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers\nAmazon and its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour but even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Walmart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nThat's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the\nReally I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier\nUm so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market as\nWal Mart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example it's hard to do so I didn't want it to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact do you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly there are places where\nThis raise we'll have more buying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses\nOn their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local markets a would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement\nWe're going to look at how far Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy\nAmazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut if you were of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nExpands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general\nKeep in mind what's happening with inflation\nIf wages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some uptick than inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers Abigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much things to any\nAs the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit\nMeanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage\nSo what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best\nAlex Harris is twenty two years old and works two part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast food chain he says he's able to pay his bills and bus fare but earning Fifteen dollars an hour full time with health benefits would help\nWhat I'll just leave it just a permanent job for ... miles but after like if you're like forty hours every week or more than that will be alert show much\nSharon ... Peterson is forty two years old and lives in Utah\nShe's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and said she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lives with her husband and his raising two kids she relies on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we had bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on Fifteen dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander Saunders who works at a community center received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour the twenty eight year old credits that wage with him being able to pay off his debts\nI actually just paid off last year at a car loan\nBut he says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with\nRoommates splitting rent them\nCities like New York Los Angeles in Seattle are mandating Fifteen dollar an hour wages the fiber Fifteen as it's known continues and now Amazon employees across the country will get to see how far the Fifteen dollar wage will take them I'm not as they go for marketplace\nWe have another slice of the Amazon story on line today and explainer on monopoly sunny try saying that five times fast and why the term might relate to Amazon on Wall street retailers paying a price for the promise of higher wages we'll have details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\nThe new NAFTA or as it's officially now in the U.S Mexico Canada agreements reached over the weekend is already raising some complaints from North of the border Canadians are worried their drug prices will go up\nThat's because one piece of the deal gives years of extended patents protection that is monopoly protection too high end expensive drugs known as biologics that means the trade deal could delay the time it takes for cheaper generic to get to market from Washington marketplaces Scott tongue reports biologic\nHow much does all this cost and where's the money coming from it costs a lot um so many of\nThese projects are mainly funded by the federal government particularly the Army Corps of engineers and FEMA in total cumulatively the U.S has been about nine billion dollars to rebuild beaches since Nineteen twenty three and when we looked at the north Carolina data after her\nState alone federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up\nAnd that you know people from all over the country coming enjoy these beaches so the government should help fund their economies the people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties\nSo these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect in which to leave alone\nThat this is sort of decided on a case by case basis\nSome communities actually find most of this work themselves through local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides\nWhich communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions they are using an economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities and the reason that is\nIs that the corps tries to see which projects can they fund where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence that ends up savoring more affluent communities\nAnd not just affluent but predominantly white right\nYes um so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics in those communities with something like Ninety four percent white and you found that the ...\nJust keep getting rebuilt over and over again can you talk about an example tell me about rights bill beach\nSure right still beach has been rebuilt I think more than twenty times in its history and uh this is a community we found where you know some of the properties right along the ocean are easily worst millions of dollars\nAt least the song she wrote about beach nourishment for for public I think you\nCan [laughter]\n\n\n\n\nFall is here folks according to the calendar anyway\nAnd it's not just the

partying was ... according to people you talk to\nYou know a number of people said to me Brett was the one at the keg he was a guy standing by the keg doing what drinking a lot and actually what was interesting to me was that you know one source said to me that Brett want it to be the guy who got the girls and he wasn't the guy who got the girls so\nHe tended to drink a lot and to some extent use

to say you know you can't lie or way onto the Supreme Court um and what did they think was the lie you know basically that Brett was whitewashing his past\nWhatever at time that you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened then I for no cause I'm never happened never said that he was I don't remember anything about us I Know\nThat he was portraying version of a young person that they did not recognize and they felt was disingenuous and that that went to the level of character\nAnd it spoke to someone's integrity and truthfulness and they thought it was important information for

and nothing ... you've got a job\nAnd for me and my personal reporting process the hearing was a really galvanizing moment as I'm dealing with these Georgetown Prep alumni who knew Kavanaugh at the time\nSo many of whom had been reluctant to speak before all of a sudden I'm getting inbound calls saying this is not an accurate portrayal we wanted to stay out of this but this is just over the top ... during the hearing he was asked about we're not on what was meant by those were not alumni references and he said\nShe was great friend of ours bunch of us went to dance with her she hung out with us as a group\nShe's a dear friend that we really respect I'm really upset that this has been taken out of context\nA media circus that it's been generated by this thought you'd reported that he
