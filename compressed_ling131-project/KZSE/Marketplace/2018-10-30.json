politics\nTaylor says the group is constantly hearing from its members about the employee who keeps wearing a political bracelet to client meetings or the one who won't stop bad mouthing the president\nTaylor says companies shouldn't ban political talk but they have to draw a line somewhere like after the twenty sixteen election when employees were threatening each other or crying at

saw in your own in boxing and your Twitter feed and your voicemail I Wonder where else did you begin to see it\nYou know you get your antenna up and suddenly as the twenty sixteen presidential campaign really kicked into gear mhm I started seeing it everywhere\nAre you familiar with this mean called Pepe the frog and one of the people who caught on to that sort of pet they raised with Donald Trump junior who had a thing for ... eating a lot of neo Nazis interestingly enough on Twitter he posted this on September tenth and there's a right in the middle of this show solidarity with the ...\nRight right with white supremacy we've gone from dog whistle too full on barking\nAnd because I knew it I could see things out there in the campaign that other people would just go right by I mean ... there was a moment where\nDonald Trump is facing backlash over this tweet that included the star of David the tweet shows the Jewish symbol over images of Hillary Clinton and dollar bills the message over the star says most corrupt candidate ever\nA lot of people said wait a minute that the Jewish star this must be an anti Semitic reference\nMegan the debate boils down to whether or not you think a six sided star looks more like a star of David or a sheriff baggage\nThey do know there'll be silly that the sheriff star but because I was trolling around looking\nAt the images on these alt right websites I knew exactly where they had gotten that it wasn't some innocent thing they didn't stumble into what they went looking for that image and somehow thought that was a good thing to send out [noise]\nAnd then the final campaign that candidate Trump ... his closing statement for the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nPolitical establishment with a new government controlled by the American people\nWas this dark dark at that spoke of global special interests coming after America\nFor those who controls the levers of power in Washington and for the global specialists they partnered with these people\nAnd as they ran these words global special interests you saw the Jewish faces of Janet Yellen the Federal Reserve chairman of Lloyd Blankfein the chairman of Goldman Sachs and of George Soros the Jewish philanthropist mhm three Jewish images\nComing on top of those words global special interest it was just hard to mistake\nAnd we will take back this country for you and we will make America great again [noise]\nI'm Donald Trump and I approve this message\n\nBut I guess they're still kind of a plausible deniability perhaps to something like that and the Trump campaign whenever they were called on it by reporters always said you were seeing things that aren't there\nThat's right and remember the plausible deniability always came from the terrorists men that is a bunker Trump now\nSo you think the president does not like using a prejudiced against you if you think about the president of the United states you back and do you know while I while I was like ... you know why they hate us daughter Kaylee\nThey say what wait a minute Donald Trump has a Jewish daughter\nIt's an Orthodox Jew he has Jewish grandchildren how dare you accuse him of anti Semitism\nSo what is it for though if the president does have a Jewish daughter and Jewish grandchildren entered Jewish ... how do we understand what you're describing is kind of unmistakable appeals to anti Semitism in an ad like this being present in the campaign\nI think Donald Trump had a very hard time turning his back on his most ardent supporters he and his campaign understood that they had really riled up the far right the alt right and that included racist that included an anti Semite\nI'm not going to choose him of racism or anti Semitism but\nI Will say that when confronted with the darker sides of his supporters he was always very reluctant to denounce them to push them away\nAnd that in your mind is just purely about an electoral calculation by the president by those around them\nIn my mind I Do not think that Donald Trump feels like he can waste or lose a single vote\nSo for me Jonathan as someone who did not have the kind of awakening that you did because of what happened to you on Twitter there was talk of anti Semitism during the campaign but it\nOften felt a little ambiguous and I actually remember vividly when that changed\n[noise]\nIt was ... it was a white nationalist rallies that seems like it was about race but suddenly you had all these young white man [noise] marching in unison\n\nShe will not replace [noise] and I remember being truly confused by that chance like why are white nationalist talking about Jews it did not make a whole lot of sense it made a lot of\nSense [noise] why\nBecause there is kind of a pantheon of evil in the old right in this new breed of\nNeo Nazis and in that pantheon\nThe watch word is white genocide that they believe that the white race is being supplanted replaced watered down\nAnd they also believe that the white race is superior to Latinos to blacks to anyone who is not white right and remembered Jews in their mind or not white\nBut they look around them and they say well wait a minute if we're the superior race how could it be that these brown skinned black skinned people are succeeding in white genocide are replacing us and that's where they look for the\nPuppet master and they find the Jews\n... Jews in the ... world are the ones who are orchestrating the white genocide maybe not the field troops the shock troops have white genocide or brown skinned black skin but the orchestra raiders of white genocide are Jews that's why Jews will not replace us\n[noise] so what's the connection why are Jews now seen as the puppet tears of Syrians Mexicans et cetera\nWell you know one of the central tenets of Judaism is remembered the stranger for you or a stranger in the land of Egypt\nLegion to welcome strangers to welcome immigrants are welcome refugees and actually American Jews really created the concept of repairing the world to food alone\nIn this kind of welcoming response to the stranger extended to the Nineteen fifties to African Americans who were then\nStoring the civil rights movement [noise]\n\nI was the rabbi all the Jewish community in ... under the regime\nThat most important things that are done in my life\nThat the bigotry\nAnd hatred\nI Know the most urgent problem\nThen adjunct\nThen disgrace for\nThe most shame for the most tragic problem is\nFiling the civil rights movement was a seminal moment for Jewish and black alliances\n\nAnd yeah and that has tremendous resonance to Jews and to know fighters in the civil rights and it also has tremendous residence for the alt right who always the Jews somewhere in the background orchestrating their demise\nWhat's kind of complicated about this discussion is that I was so prepared to have you told me that all these troops you heard about were sexually falls but what's really tricky about this conversation and hard to grapple with is that Jews in America have done the things\nMy welcoming outsiders that they're being accused of\nIn ways that completely defy all of a simple heat but what white nationalist believe that these things you're describing are being done not out of altruism not out of a kind of spirit generosity but to undermine white people they see it as something being taken away rather than something being given", "show_name": "Marketplace", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "30"}
