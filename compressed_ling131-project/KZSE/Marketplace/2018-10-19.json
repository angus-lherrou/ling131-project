October good is always to have your long everybody I Know Monday seems like a long time ago always does come friday afternoons of late but that's where he got to start if you want to explain what happened in the past five days which is what we are going to do when it Lopez is at Business Insider ritual Abrams\nIs with the New York times they're both in our New York studios Airbus\nWhere'd you go back to ... ah the deficit figures from the Treasury Department of Seventeen percent from a year ago seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars would kinda seems a bit those numbers of lost all meaning though they are\nWell sort of I mean everyone told Republicans is was going to happen and they did it anyway it um you know the the\nThe deficit is the difference between how much we're spending and how much we're collecting how that continuously grows\nFor some reason conservatives have managed to convince Americans that if we collect less money will have more money against all logic so now everyone's and in the Republican Party saying we might have to cut entitlements because now we have this crazy deficit and more money is going to go to interest payments\nWe can't have that but everybody told them from the beginning that this is how it was going to look\nAnd uh it's just sad that we have this kind of weird cognitive dissonance ...\nBears mentioning here not for the first time I was ready or broken originally rooms with the touch which I've never been to themselves\nAh right and so I think I think that that sort of the great irony in all of this is that um [noise] the tax cuts of the G O P push through which primarily benefitted or I guess you should say benefited corporation and a and very wealthy individuals the most\nThat in order to pay for those tax cuts uh you have Mitch McConnell talking about ... to rise and rise cuts to entitlement programs\nAnd I think that kind of goes back to the question of well why do we care about the national debt why do we care about the deficit\nUm it wouldn't you spend increasingly more and more and more money you have the calls to get rid of entitlement programs like Medicare Social security that kind of stuff\nAh those calls get louder and louder and louder because um you know that because the Republicans are going to be ... at least right now advocating more for businesses and then for those programs so cynical\nDon't want to do from the from the beginning was was make it necessary to shrink with federal and learn how to even\nThough let's be clear Paul Ryan said this going on a year ago now right that that entitled entitlements where the next thing but rich let me let me continue with completely foreseeable circumstances but now appear on our national arise and uh there was news this week or more trade unrest Wilbur Ross was in Europe complaining about the European trade deals\nOr the Chinese now that is another thing that has seemingly heated up again with Larry Kudlow saying things but we got hard numbers from deep BMW down in South Carolina it's these terrorists are going to cost them a half a billion dollars a year it's not like nobody knew this was coming\n[noise] yeah and I think especially going into the midterms people are really wondering you know how it's going to go into effect really hotly contested races you have soybean farmers in Iowa that were really concerned about the price of their crops going down because of the trade war\nI'm ... President Trump announced that he was going to be providing twelve billion dollars in aid to farmers that are hurt by the trade war which hopefully will help boost up a sort of his core constituents source centrally we're subsidizing a trade war perhaps to help her in the Republican Party in the midterms\nI'm not who knows who knows right before we sat down here to tell an ounce and it was going to have laugh so Ford has already announced they're going to do laugh so ... had the Americans\nBut wait a second because when the president says this on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment's low we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not to like\nWell except for some one time charges in those tax benefits than benefit from the tax cuts actually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby\nWhich means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot which is an indicator that um maybe things aren't going as well as\nA as people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow on and it it\nQuarter if they don't have those one time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market is probably going to react pretty badly to that Joe uh enjoy the fun while it lasts a\nOn the market thing was one I don't want to go too far to this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now the ... and we haven't seen for very long time\n[noise] yes I and it's really interesting because the president has taken a lot of credit when we've seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessors when we have seen depths\nUm I don't really ... and I think a lot of people a lot of economists and fight financial and business experts would agree that the markets are the stock markets are not particularly good indicator up some of the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see\nI'm the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past\nYear and these are dramatic falls like a thousand other points that I mean you're ugly snuff and of course Trump used a tweet that if that happened to president should be fired ... bomb administrator is a ...\nThere is a river everything when you get the last word he got twenty seconds to do it just really quickly the fed minutes this week and and ... basically saying everything's fine we're going to keep perusing ridge everybody stay calm\n[noise] yeah I mean the you know there's no reason for him not to trade change course I think the stock market again is not the economy and President Trump should have absolutely nothing to say about the fat\nSo there's actually no reason for drum how to change course it's not in his data and the stock market should not be something that he's worried about in fact he what the fed is probably looking at is topping a bubble\nIn somebody's phone when officers will you goes you've been doing this for a long time now turn your phones off in the studio ...

D. dot com and Ali Baba ...\nOther firms selling low end products like instant noodles and pickled mustard greens have reported soaring profits could these be signs of trying to shoppers becoming more frugal\nBut I don't think there's any significant evidence that this is a big macro story\nNicholas Lardy is an economist with the Peterson Institute in Washington he says retail sales data recently did show slower than expected growth but that's only focused on good he says spending on services went up plus wages are increasing\nWith incomes rising and the savings rate going down that's a very powerful combination for sustaining fairly strong growth of consumption\nMany economists agree with him so if it's not showing up in the data then why they're so much talk about consumption downgrade Lardy says Chinese citizens maybe picking up a larger narrative in the U.S that China's economy is slowing down\nAnd the implications seems to be that China will be very vulnerable to the tariffs that a President Trump has imposed on Chinese goods sold in the United states\nOther said to talk of the consumption downgrade is rooted in rising home prices\nFinance in Beijing he says people must borrow more to pay for our home and mortgages make up the bulk of China's household debt\nAlready ... from two thousand two thousand seven ... China's ratio of household debt to GDP went from Eighteen to fifty percent to thirty two percent increase in less than ten years whereas it took a few decades for that to happen in the U.S\nHe says that makes people anxious and psychology plays a big role in consumption just ask David Wilder managing editor with Financial Times confidential research each month his firm's surveys consumers in

economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users and a court filing this week sheds new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to Asia\nWelcome to the program thanks for having me to go back a couple of years ago April two thousand sixty and ... says we are pivoting video at Facebook and journalism to does what\n[laughter] journalism pivots with it basically\nAnd they say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this law suits but maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I I mean I think for publishers this was kind of a second costs fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook ads they see these kinds of eating into that traffic so Facebook's has represented video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook says jumping publisher I say OK how high man so they invest all these resources into doing video and then in twenty six you know twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate writers and higher video producer is how this happened to places like ah\nMTV News and having to rocket as Mike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nOr so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but a ... the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook should we ... were these video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week not only were they lesson president and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with as many of you accounts [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nI mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go around here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe aren't\nDid they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream and ah yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or or I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted um because of what Facebook's you to do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing Facebook is doing and they think this this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped into both eat what is Facebook opposite first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried claims in the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took them a kind of ... when these discrepancies kind of first uh emerge publicly\nBut I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that but it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters opening and Gordon and everybody's going to have absolutely Microsoft restrict writer for my first of all thank you [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWas followed on the other day in which I Am sorry to be the one to have to tell you but
