I Would have bought ... because\nDidn't think we should have paid it put us knew all so many places I've forgotten number of how many branches we got but in those days you got the one down the street from my house where I bank I mean right and which country you're in California after we've gone from seven or branches to a thousand I think it was a fabulous platform for Jake more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now to avoid something like that happening again\nYeah you should never be satisfied and I think I'm more explain that ... the regularly should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap I give you just do leeman redux\nIt wouldn't happen they would have had not twenty below the capital but

hundred billion dollars of equity are the most over capitalized for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah but ... it was a disorderly unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse 'cause they had to sell assets\nThat was ... so the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger\nBut with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess where the future as I say what is the worst you could possibly be and can we handle it\nAnd to me family means I can still sort of my

it possible that down the road something happens it's too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my and my company could easily handle it but it is possible just like just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like James it can cause problems I mean you always gotta be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes\nYou jumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get to ... but the look let me back you up for a minute on the healthy account and I'm not going to argue that the headline fat drive jobs GDP all of that good stuff\nBut as you sit around the forty whatever it is Florida this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some not small problems\nYeah so the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen them do what I mean I I went to it but the good in the back yard so the good as we have\nNeighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all all of the food water and energy we need\nWe have ... or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech freedom of enterprise the best universities wisely with capital markets\nAnd yes income inequality the real issue and we studied it and they're fixed as to what the economy's been going in ... and ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation\nAnd all these other things that we need to fix okay but load and there are fix the American public will do everything we talk about their or fixes for be put her mind to it and kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it I appreciate the\nPositivity generally I Do if there was some reality are right we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said at the at the un across town a couple of days ago it is America First\nHow do you reconcile that with what you call for in your letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nWhere virtually have slipping a bit so that we have not had more of a cat or Mexico's Eighteen forty eight Mexico's accident quite well and we should treat them very respectfully but you're absolutely correct this trade issue a medical a skirmish\nYeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade was so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish 'cause it sure doesn't look like anybody back into\nThat look we advise the president that while you were young while you were you yeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand the issue to China and he's right\nNon ... barriers will property all intellectual property is owned enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day the president succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems\nSo she'll put on your your most objective Jamie diamonds self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you I don't think so I mean there are all in a lot of ... or ... eight\nMillion companies in America I mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy and there are a lot of other big banks still am I I'm going to be confused when the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money they were worth more than the market value there's so many things make more money than we do they have aspirations and they showed\nTheir going overseas and they should they're fine they are Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also have to compete when they alley pay and we chat and ten cent and so I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're gonna have competitors I

Ninety five showed that he was bleeding money by two thousand and five it showed that he was making significant amounts of money so we started trying to figure out\nHow does the guy go from having a loss of nine hundred million dollars plus in Nineteen Ninety five to booking a hundred and fifty million dollars of income in two thousand and five what's going on was there something extraordinary that happened in his life that year and then we came across this little smattering of clips\nThat mention that in two thousand for\nDonald Trump and his siblings fits sold their fathers real estate empire in Brooklyn for over six hundred million dollars I mean that that's interesting\nAnd it made us want to learn everything we possibly could about that particular empire\nAnd we started reaching out to people who had been involved in an empire that disputes with it worked for a trying to\nReconstruct a fifty year history of red Trump in New York City\nWe started going through these documents previously unseen documents and then we called people again and again and eventually we're left with a detailed view of Fred Trump's empire no one had ever seen before\n[noise]\nSo tell me about Fred

huge projects with low interest government guaranteed loans and keeping the costs so low that he was guaranteed a life of extraordinary well [noise]\nSo as you're going through all of Fred Trump's documents at what point does Donald Trump up here\nDonald Trump starts to show up in his father's business affairs when he's three years old in Nineteen forty nine\nSo what the documents reveal to us was that when Donald Trump was three years old he was actually read Trump's landlord\nFred Trump gives his children the land under these massive apartment projects that he's built and then begins pain

least a car for you felt dispersed offices in Manhattan for him he also found ways to give him the laundry revenue from his building and then in Nineteen Seventy six you see this article and the New York times\nIf you took the New York times reporter on a tour of what he was describing as his empire showing this reporter all the things he's done all the things he's built all of his jobs this building\nIn this building and you must build a what we now know from looking at these records is if it was all his father's empire his father's success and he was just appropriating all of that has his own to build his own death\nIs a sort of like the first instance where you just see the light began\nThank you Mr Trump for joining us this morning decided then I have heard that you are worth

know if anyone ever asked the question in my smarter than other people are able to convince the bankers to given these tremendously\nOutsized loans based just on the image the myth that he's\nBuilt for himself already at one thing that we found that I don't think anybody ever knew before is that his father goes along with the ride on some of that\nSo one of the revelations we came across in the documents was how frightened\nTogether for example in the late Nineteen eighties Donald made a public comment that he was going to take over time Inc magazine publishing company his father did buy stock right before Donald made those comments in a week later sold it and he wound up making forty thousand dollars just on his son's hot air\nBase and it was very clear manifestation of these two
