in this trade war we're still having with the Chinese hard quantitative things each side can do terrorists themselves or a good example of those ten or maybe twenty five percent import taxes on a whole list of goods shipped by each side to the other\nAlso softer were qualitative things like just not buying certain things the other country selves and for our purposes right now one of those certain things as American oil which China has basically stopped buying Rebecca Elliot covers energy for the wall Street Journal welcome to broker\nThanks for having I visit seems like a substantial drop in Chinese imports American oil what is going on so as\nThe trade tensions between the U.S and China have escalated in recent months even though China has not imposed any terrorists on us crude the U.S exports to China actually drop to zero in August after about\nThree hundred and fifty thousand barrels a day of crude in the first half of the year so a very significant drop it\nAnd we're we're reasonably sure that it's all trade related right they just decided we don't want to buy this stuff anymore we're going to get our oil elsewhere\nRight so it may be that Chinese companies are kind of looking to limit purchases of US soil in case they trade tensions escalate further and you know let's say tariffs were imposed are created\nSure uh we should point out here that it's not like the global market is is a an unwelcome place for oil exporter so American crude does have somewhere to go\nYes exactly and the first week of this month actually us crude exports nearing two point six

tariffs on American X.\nNeed those exports to make the businesses work and even when the White House announced back in August it was going to offer twelve billion dollars in farm aid to mitigate some of those losses they said they would much rather just have the market work\nAbout a tenth of that twelve billion dollars is going to go to buying crops that probably would have been sold to China but

replace the foods that we can continue serving families need\nBut for now groups like Dave Rich in United food bank our focus more on the short term\nDoesn't really sound like you're too worried about

while I don't want to say that any group of voters did not have the potential to be decisive but if you look at twenty sixteen and you look at today the group that has moved the most\nIs white women and especially white women with college degrees and if you're looking at the suburbs of Chicago or the suburbs of Philadelphia those are the people who voted Republican in the past maybe voted for Trump in twenty sixteen and have voted for Democrats pretty strongly\nSince then oh how are Republicans trying to protect these thirty seats\nThey're trying to do a couple of things at once and sometimes it's sort of an internally contradictory strategy the main thing they're trying to do is just disqualify Democrats that they're trying to go into these suburban communities\nTalked to white women talk to white men as well and say if you don't like the president you know fine but here's some things to be scared about about the Democrats\nResist he's demanding open for the ones who are listening to law enforcement agencies that enforces immigration laws America's doors to more wind [noise] these are votes\nIt like a Democrat like a Joe Biden or even a Brock Obama but they're not going to care for Bernie Sanders right they're not going to care for abolishing ice or certain kinds of rhetoric around national security or policing the use our\nRitzy white suburbs right and a lot of the stereotypes that people think of tend to apply in these places\nYou've heard and O'Neill Delgado is extreme and eventually ... now now do admit she'd bring the same ideals to Congress\nThey're going on TV with these searing personal attack as looking at people's business records in one case a candidate background as a rapper it's just one of the most brutally personal negative campaigns I've ever seen in a midterm election\nMexican millennials Democrat named mark ... doesn't get us support from the San Diego\nThe other side of it is that you see Republicans trying to put issues out there they get their own base excited so even in suburban district there are many voters who are enthusiastic about President Trump and twenty sixteen\nAnd many of them are less energized right now than the Democrats so what Republicans are trying to do at the same time as they talk to moderate and say you can't trust the Democrats are the party of polo see there's a party of antifa\nAt a party of abolish ice they're also trying to talk to their own voters and remind them of the things that the president has done that they like\nConservative Britain means getting the job done [noise] I'm Troy dollars all in sanctuary city to stop illegals from taking our jobs fight alongside Trump implement his agenda and use conservative threats to fill the dawn wall\nThere's not really a great precedent for getting voters to show up just to say you know good job I appreciate it so what you see Republicans doing in this case and Democrats did a little bit of this eight years ago is trying to hammer home to the president's core supporters what a threat the opposition party is too\nIt's the it's if you elect the opposition party they will try to impeach me they investigate me they will end to me as a really functioning\nGovernment leader so the strategy has not please thank me it's knows that if houses lots of Democrats it will destroy it saved me [noise] so this sounds to me Alex harder for the Republicans then for the Democrats\nIs there a realistic version of this way the Democrats don't take back the has despite meeting just a third of the seats that you identify as somehow play sure it's\nDefinitely harder for Republicans right now than it is for Democrats but you can see a scenario where Republicans hold the house and that probably involves conservative voters getting much more mobilized over the next month and Republicans can reach some of these suburban voters and sort of played with them to remember the in their hearts they're Republicans all along\nDo you expect Brett Kavanaugh to factor into the house races in a meaningful way and what would that look like in these suburban districts\nI'm going to give you a little bit of a we usually answer and that I think he will matter and I think it's hard to say how\nYou probably will have conservative voters who are more tuned in now than they were a month ago because they got engaged and angry about the Supreme Court fight you'd probably also are going to have\nThose monitor white women who have been talking about it's not going to do them any favors with the Republican Party to have washed that fight unfold so I think the outcome in the house is ambiguous is much much clearer in the Senate and the story there is almost exactly the opposite of what we're seeing in the house [noise]\nWe'll be

back the set up\nThey need to gain two seats to take control to try and birds fifty one forty nine now a ... broken by the vice president if Democrats gain one see Republicans do have control only they only have to win too says they need to gain two seats to win two seats Republicans hold\nSo how many races are there in the Senate where either a Democrat could take a seat from Republican or Republican could take a seat from a Democrat there were ten races that were watching really closely right now most of them are in seats currently held by Democrats so it's really the mirror image of the house Democrats are mostly on defense\nOr six seats Democrats are defending where they're really at serious risk almost all of them are in states where President Trump won by a huge margin and twenty sixteen so you're talking about centers like Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota Claire McCaskill in Missouri Joe Donnelly\nIn Indiana and these are people who are populist Democrats who\nAre just running up a really big hill and Trump country right now\nIs there any shared story to what puts these three Democrats in danger in those three states you mentioned\nThe biggest forces are definitely national cultural forces but you're also talking about members of the Senate who stood with Brock Obama when he was passing a lot of liberal policy that was just not popular in these places there by and large people who've been strong supporters of the Affordable CARE Act\nBack when it was unpopular of the Iran deal of cap and trade and there are people who have recently voted against the cabinet nominations\nHow are these three Democrats fighting for their seats given the voting record you just describe what's the case that they're making to their Trump supporting voters in these states many of them are trying to align themselves with the president on a couple of key issues like trade\nI Know how hard northern ... wearing and that's why I like to open up foreign markets Springer I knew a lot of my own and to roll back in PA rules that hurt our farmers I'm Heidi Heitkamp than I approve this message\nYou have mid western Democrats not just in Indiana but also in safer states for Democrats like Wisconsin and Ohio really sort of cheering the president on as he confronts\nSeeing them economically you see them trying to go after their Republican opponents as elitist and as

Joe Donnelly has been attacking his Republican challenger for some of his international business deals\nLike there are certainly Indiana out\nIn Missouri Claire McCaskill this is maybe the purest form
