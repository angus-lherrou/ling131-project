America's Test kitchen [noise] we've got an incredible story about a pilgrimage in India to cook for a got us and we'll hear about an iconic writer who mused on both feasting and fast and let's get the desert first\n\nWhen I was in ... school [noise] Fifteen Years ago I knew a woman named Stella [noise] she was a pastry chef in the making and we really didn't know each other that well but she was smart and thoughtful and at some point I went through a really rough patch where I really needed a friend and she was there and she showed me\nMost she graduated not long after and we fell out of touch with eight years later we found each other on the Internet she become extra chef but even more she'd be done writing\nQuirky terrific blog\nAnd eventually got more and more into writing about

few months ago I was so thrilled to see her first cookbook Braveheart debut on the New York times so\nA hostile thanks so much for joining us examined me\nSo I Want to talk to you about the subtitle of your book actually it's iconic American desserts so what ...\nI really wanted the book to be a collection of desserts that the majority of us could say played an important role in our childhood\nSo for me growing up in Kentucky sweet potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had around the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realized pretty quickly that you know outside of the south not a lot of people are eating sweet potato pie\nAnd and so that's not iconic it's a very American desert but it's not iconic because there's plenty of Americans who you know born and raised here this is their country this is the culture that they love and they've never had that so I didn't want the book to be a collection of\nRegional desserts were desserts that were important to some people but not others I wanted to be this celebration of all the desserts that connect us together coast to coast and\nSo how did you decide which books qualified\nMaybe it's kind of like that um classic a quote about porn that you'll you'll know when you see it but you kind of have this instinct right like I mean from the yellow cake Betty Crocker and ducking Heinz have ensure that yellow cake is something that all Americans had a chance to try and love and\nWe all know white cake is we all know chocolate chip cookies are and so on a certain level of some of it's instinctual but then there's other ones that\n... and tell me about this pilgrimage ... what are these women doing [noise] it's\nA pilgrimage where millions of women traveled to one city to cook a dish together and that simplifying in a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us\nBull and a city called ... and the trains are filled with women starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to this place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride 'em and the women are taking with them a single bag usually they have a bad that is filled with\nAll of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ... and the entire ceremony revolves around arriving to the temple arriving to the city and everyone's setting up\nAnd what they're setting up our a makeshift hearth\nOf three bricks a clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and they set up all over the city so they're you know how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow yes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was\nClose to four million\nWow big year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to a goddess yeah that's the way that they refer to her\nIs actually called my mom um she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such mythology around all of this if this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity usually known as ... and um she's worshipped locally by these women and she's seen as sort of a a giving figure but also a very intense strong and some times furious figure\n... so set the scene for me so you were there and there's millions of women are setting up makeshift hearth with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously ... which is an amazing bought 'em and tell me about what they're cooking [noise] so\nThe morning that this happens and women wake up very early ah they\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from your age or go healthcare education software

signal from the temple comes in a signal is that um the priest and the temple lights a fire\nAnd that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then there are also volunteers running around and helping to light heart so all at once at the same exact moments all around the city there speakers that women light a fire\nAnd they all start cooking so was actually really incredible about this is this now you're you're walking around the city all of the smoke is all over the place and everything smells like Vern rice and fire and coconut bark\nAnd these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes and they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment [noise] [noise]\nAnd they're really cooking so tell us a it's a rice porridge yes\nSo they basically they start off they have a a clay pot over an open fire 'em they add water\nThey wait for the water to boil and then they have this specific kind of race it's called Carolyn rice or read rice it's got a partial has left on so that has a ... hue and they scatter rice into the pot usually in three handfuls\nAnd then the they wait for the for the pot to boil and part of the ceremony is at the ... must boil over to satisfy that got us so when you look around all of these pots are bubbling over the sort of steamy was

[noise]\nAnd we have a number of black\nEye for an hour you very well may call your Francis please do thank you for the call\nYour voice is such a familiar and pleasant one it permeates our entire house as we have speakers and all the rooms and we've we've listened to you so much and so so often that a year like my brother you've been you've been here at home\nWith us in Ecuador [laughter] thank you I Hope to actually come back we're one day a credibly beautiful but uh what are we talking about\nWell here's the problem by uh we live in a very hot place or do we get a real like our nor Easterners or like eighty five degrees and that's what we put on a sweater\nOr it it is very hot and very humid all the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything and uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even salt not not so much because Salt Lake preservation but just to get the dry\nAnd a ... and so we we really are are very careful with a you know how we store things and one day we were having a party and a friend came a friend had just come from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto a huge chunk like\nThree pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of ... ... it's just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it ... around him and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do with this enormous chunk\nAnd so in the midst of the party at my wife says why should we cut the what we address it\nAnd it's in there and ah anyway we have no idea what to\nDo once we defrost it just we cannot possibly\nThree pounds or ... before which and I totally committed\nTo your to your suggestions because this morning knowing it would be speaking to my what pulled a free ... currently defrosting\n[laughter] oh wow so you're okay there's no turning back yeah there's no [laughter]\nYou've you've cut the guardian not on the frozen per se you know I see this\nIs an interesting problem I Am honored that you would trust me with it I Hope I don't feel you have to say I've never actually had to deal too much with a giant frozen block appreciate them\nBefore that's a that's neither one of ... in some ways a a blessing problem now have to tell you given the fact that it was frozen in a home freezer I don't know how well it's going to defrost meaning if my questions to\nYeah if you flash freeze meats and things of that nature in a in a unit industrial freezer that didn't work because it freezes it so quickly\nThat the ice crystals um stay pretty small but just like ... and then they're they're they're in a home freezer because it takes a while but ice crystals start to grow and they and they start to poke through the cell walls and so you may find that leak some juice\nAnd you may find that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be quite as um for more you know sort of to some as it was before\nAnd maybe not as delicate that said if it's not totally be frosted what I might think about doing is if you have a\nA deli or if you haven't done we slice yourself you know a deli nearby mental you'd consider running over there and having them slice it thin while it's still a partially frozen so\nSlice and thin\nMight have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase about too much damage that said the other thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful texture as when it was you know originally a fresh per se um but so I think about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask dessert cooking solution because I thought the same thing that it would probably was it was deposited even if it were sliced up it wouldn't be quite the same\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in in ways where maybe your wrapping it around something maybe a wrapping it around this piece of chicken you wrapping it around something and then you can sort of cigarettes you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise]\nUm [noise] you can cut it into chunks and use it to do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a salty cure ham if you're if you're not in a position to be able to enjoy it and it's sort of like\nSilky thin sliced a state [noise]\nNo I assumed that since sliced phase of it slices over that it would be something\n[laughter] I Wonder even\nOr even thought maybe it was just playing the whole thing and the slow cooker and sort of raising the whole time and\nYou know I have never done that but I\nIs that thing right where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose\n[laughter] so hey\nTry and I'm sure someone in Italy with like you know rolling their grave when they heard someone done this to appreciate but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure the texture may not have all the flavor on a beautiful cure flavor is going to be there so if you do that in a slow cooker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly rich delicious um it'll go quite salty so of course you you want to think about that one\nAnd the pieces and use it to flavor a larger dish I'm set of cooking the whole thing ... or ... you know in the in the American south they had these um cured hands that they do exactly that with\nIts cured it's air dried and then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slice it indeed thin you took the whole I Am and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out and you might see some of that\nLiquid 'em to use to me and not make would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze not and use that as a ... a a flavor base rather stocks and then eat the meat\n[noise] you know I think I I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it or you know it's a flavor and has served for vegetable dishes and maybe\nSauces and things like that I I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a dish called ... and one of the things it's like a big giant stew and one of the things they should do is put a big piece of pork belly you know not like not like sliced bake it a big square of it into which at them\nAs a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish for the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so it kind of like that idea of mine yeah different names you're\nCutting it in half and using some of it for chunks for added to the vegetables stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and see what happens\nYeah yeah yeah well if you cut it ... nice and small you can start that in a pan um you know render its fat and maybe you can add a little more olive oil or or or other fats in the pan when they get a little bit nice and brown scramble some eggs in that and that would be\nSo delicious yeah I don't you know I Would like use the push you do with something that's maybe one or two other ingredients you know just really kind of feature that flavor 'cause I mean it's a beautiful flavor whenever you do with it\nThank you but thanks so much for this fantastic in", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city":
