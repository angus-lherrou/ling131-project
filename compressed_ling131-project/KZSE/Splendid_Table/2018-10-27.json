word acid\nI guarantee you the host goes survey says the board flips acid lights up and you take home fabulous prizes and that's because chefs are always talking about how the splash acidic vinegar is what elevate the dish\nAnd Michael Harlan ... should know he spent his whole career around chefs first as a cook himself and then it's a photographer and writer and he's made himself an expert on vinegars\nHe's traveled the world for them he infuses them and yes he makes them in his apartment a contributor shot a fever talks with Michael about bringing this restaurant secret weapon home\nI think so much for talking with us I don't think travelling you see how it tell us how your obsession with the world of vinegar came to that I think the same way most people make\nLeaving a bottle of red wine out and open on the table but it kinda snowballed into a couple of other alcohol and had a leftover quarter keg that I poured into a barrel and it turned into the best ... vinegar I've ever had in my life\nSo definitely a happy accident\nIt it is and now it's absurd obsession [laughter]\nNow your book reveals vinegar to be so much more of our soil and the kitchen that we might realize so can you tell us about some of the main functions and cooking and baking\nYeah vinegar as a flavor carrier is not just this overt thing that kind of\nPunches you in the chest and makes you cough it it is a vehicle for a lot of other flavors to kind of co mingling coalesce so you know when you make of vinegar grad either two two one two or three to one ratio oil the vinegar um you're actually trying to express the nuances in the Roma individually gr by carrying it in that fat\nAnd that kinda carries over and a lot of cooking process these it de glazes pans to pick up the fond I'm it stabilizes egg whites and Marines uh it is a really interesting part of cooking because as overt as we think it is is that it's actually about a balanced harmony and a lot of other cuisines\nAnd of course in baking vinegar it's used in so many old fashioned baking recipes to react with a ... and says well\nOh absolutely that science experiment of baking soda and vinegar you know shooting up like a volcano ah certainly is kind of like what Irish soda bread is a you know using that as a full Evan\n[noise] what are the things I found so fascinating in your book is that you chose to organize\nPart of the book by different cuisines across the globe give us an example the vinegars that are unique to certain places and how they're used [noise]\nGoing to go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of butter a lot of cream um and it's delicious because of those things but\nHave some kind of the city to balance all that out you find vinegar and Bernays you find vinegar and holidays and most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient and moving Italy I just got back from a trip and mail you remind me a region where ... is king\nAnd ... another thing is probably the most ubiquitous vinegar around the world now\nBut the amount that's made for traditional a which is the original ball summit vinegar which really wasn't exported to the states if not worlds until like the Nineteen seventies a such a small amount is made that a lot of people have and you can experience that so seeing that vinegar in contacts and seeing that his\nBarely used as an application where you heat it up you know on top of a little age parmesan or strawberries or maybe the accent or stuffed pasta um\nThan in Austria I think quite possibly the greatest vinegar maker in the world lives in Vienna and he is singular in that he makes vinegars from single ingredients a tomato saffron red pepper a trucking Baron ... and\nAnd make the things that are so linear and pure that I've never tasted a vinegar so expressive of its you know inherent self\nAnd then you have things like ... an Asian cuisines\nThis was another thing that I only really experienced\nYou know ... ... con rice vinegar the things you buy in supermarkets but when you taste a real race vinegar it's kind of like taking you know a ... or ... for the first time a there is so much\nExpression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and raise vinegar can be the same way there isn't just acidity there there is flavor are dependent on what kind of rice to use and how much is polished down and on top of that you know the traditional Raisman or coma zoo as probably the standard the gold standard of ...\nThis red vinegar made from the age ... and it literally turns almost black and ... wouldn't boxes before it's pressed um then there's ... from the southwest of accuse you provinces black vinegar that's used more as a drinking vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\nHappening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... and art and vinegar but what some of the elements maybe as soon as the more scientific elements that give vinegars there distinct flavors\nWell then there is nothing more than four to six percent of the the acid and solution and that solution is\nWater so kind of like wind there all these\nVolatile Esther as these aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're chasing and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with a CD gas it and you know kind of goes through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but vinegar or a is\nOften the sensation before it's a flavor so you think that on your palette you you have that you know feeling of brightness of lightning it makes you celebrate a little bit and that's when it hits and that's when the flavors get picked up so like I had been saying before it it is a carrier but\nThe thing that it initially does is open up your palate to be able to experience those flavors\nIf anyone is going to get a snake vinegar at home it's going to the year ... [laughter] what some of the basic tools we need to get started\nFirst you need a good juice I'm vinegar is made from any starch that can convert into sugar that can turn into an alcohol and then eventually become vinegar or see the gas it so you have to find one of those basis uh starches include grains and Rice's sugars include honey and\nAnd this is much cheaper than the first generation I'm CB devices needs to be they used to be a lot thicker a lot slower and now they're very light very easy very fast and they work very well there are also connected to why fight and Bluetooth so the jewel works via an app on your smartphone which is pretty convenient\nAnd they used to be like a thousand bucks for two hundred way way cheaper now too so I guess the time starts to ... they're like so much for that\n[laughter] and thanks for having me [noise]\nMollie ... is executive editor of science at America's Test kitchen\nYou can find a soup viewed recipe for Mexican roast pork coach need a peace deal\nThat splendid table dot org [noise] coming up I get to talk with you and we have a love story that evolved over oysters [noise] I'm Francis lamp and this is the splendid table from ATM American public media\nProgramming is supported by Comcast Business providing a gigs speed network and innovative applications that can help businesses move beyond Comcast Business beyond fast more at Comcast Business dot com [noise]\nWith less than two weeks in the midterms President Trump is doing all he can to fire up the Republican base and really\nWith early voting already under way which side is more fired up by the president next time on the politics show from NPR [noise]\nThat's right as the mid term elections draw closer we continue with our special Saturday morning show the politics show from National Public radio this morning at ten o'clock right here on to Minnesota Public radio news of course that show runs through the midterms good morning you're listening\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...
