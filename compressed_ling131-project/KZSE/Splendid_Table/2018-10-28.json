D glazes pans to pick up the fond I'm it stabilizes egg whites in her rings a it is a really interesting part of cooking because as overt as we think it is is that is actually about the balance and harmony and a lot of other cuisines\nAnd of course in baking vinegar it's used in so many old fashioned baking recipes to react with the ... and says well\nOh absolutely that science experiment of baking soda and vinegar you know shooting up like a volcano ah certainly is kind of like what Irish soda bread is uh\nWhat are the things I found so fascinating in your book is that you chose to organized\nPart of the book by different cuisines across the globe give us an example of vinegar that are unique to certain places and how they get\nI'm going to go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of butter a lot of cream um and it's delicious because of those things but those sauces have vinegar and have some kind of the city to balance all that out\nYou find vinegar and Bernays you find vinegar in Holland days most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient and moving in Italy I just got back from a trip and mail you remind your region where ... is king\nAnd ... another thing is probably the most ubiquitous vinegar around the world now\nBut the amount that's made for traditional a which is the original ball semi vinegar which really wasn't exported to the states if not world until like the Nineteen seventies a such a small amount is made that a lot of people having even experienced it so seeing that vinegar in contacts and seeing that his\nBarely used as an application where you heat it up you know on top of a little age parmesan or strawberries or maybe the accent a stuffed pasta um\nThan in Austria I think quite possibly the greatest vinegar maker in the world lives in Vienna and he is singular in that he makes vinegar from single ingredients a tomato saffron\nRed pepper a trucking Baron ... and and make these things that are so linear and pure that I've never tasted a vinegar so expressive of its you know inherent self\nAnd then you have things like ... an Asian cuisines\nThis was another thing that I had only really experienced you know ... or ms counter ... Khan rice vinegars the things you buy and\nA real race vinegar it's kind of like taking a shot of ... or ... for the first time a there is so much\nExpression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and raise vinegar can be the same way\nThere isn't just acidity there there is flavor are dependent on what kind of rice they use and how much is polished down and on top of that you know the traditional race when a coma zoo as probably the standard the gold standard of rice vinegars in Japan but then there's aka sue this red vinegar\nMade from the age ... and it literally turns almost black and ... wouldn't boxes before it's pressed um then there's ... from the southwest of the ... province and it's black vinegar that's used more as a drinking vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\nHappening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... and art and vinegar but what some of the elements maybe as soon as the more scientific elements that give vinegars there distinct flavors\nWell then there is nothing more than four to six percent a CD acid and solution and that solution is\nWater so kind of like wine there all these volatile Esther as these aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're chasing and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with us he the guy said and you know kind of goes through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but vinegar or a is\nOften the sensation before it's a flavor so you think that on your palette you you have that you know feeling of brightness of enlightening it makes you celebrate a little bit and that's when it hits that's when the flavors get picked up so like I had been saying before it is a carrier but\nThe thing that it initially does is open up your ... to ...\nIt's going to get a snake vinegar at home it's going to be you tell a whole life [laughter]\nThere and there are a ton of options for the home cook and they actually picked a winner which is called the jewel circulate her\nAnd it's small and it's sleek and it is incredibly accurate it's really wonderful and about how much is the jewel so the jewel is around two hundred dollars and this is much cheaper than the first generation I'm CB devices needs to be they used to be a lot thicker a lot\nSlower now they're very light to very easy very fast and they work very well there are also connected to why fight and Bluetooth so the jewel works via an app on your smartphone which is pretty convenient\nAnd they used to be like a thousand bucks for two hundred and way way cheaper now too so I guess the term starts circulating they're like so much for that\n[laughter] thanks for having me [noise]\nMollie ... is executive editor of science at America's Test kitchen you can find those supersede recipe for Mexican roast pork coach need a peace deal

three seven five to five to we want to know what you're cooking sixty about let's do it [noise]\nWe as a mandate on the line from Decatur, Georgia ... good how are you I'm well thank you what we're supposed to talk about\nSo about a year ago I went to my friend filed challenged beautiful liquor is that right there and I was so jealous I couldn't stop talking about it my friend got me well I think a little ... at the joke and then for my birthday this year he got me the phrase or a ... a ... it can make something with them\nA problem with I don't know what to make with them um I experimented a little bit I've made to step a chicken legs in the Fraser\nI've made 'em some ... but that's really all I Know how to do and I would love to be able to use them more and show off you know aids I guess\nOr so you got as a gift a B\nThere about what size is it um\nI Would say probably watching and shit pretty large\nA big you know like a a big oh yeah oh cool and then\nYou have some cats aren't cook cuts which was like they're basically a little mini razors right and how big are those are the kind of semi shape so and I can\nOkay so what's those I have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable um I think baked eggs are shirt eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type of pot because I'm\nA I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more Neanderthal English so I um [laughter] so I don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that like a single serving of\nMaybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread and there were like you know do it on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or Jew for breakfast or ... exactly what you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham\nAnd just sort of low heat in the oven to sort of gently bake they're just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation um but\nYou're twelve or fourteen inch praise or another they were talking because that is a really fun to be so quick to have [noise]\nI think for that I Want to talk to you about in general I think that kind of pot does really well so what I think it's a beautiful about like a big cast iron an animal brains are like you say as\nA cast iron so holds heat really well\nAnd I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action and there would you certainly can but for me I think what's exciting about that is that it can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking\nAnd so what that means to me is if your searing say you know short ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you want ... chicken and you want to see the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like heartier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but over like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like ripping up the all the way high you know what I mean\nAnd you know get the oil and there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel season them lay him and they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a more intense or like a deeper seer is maybe a better way to describe it and the pan holds that heat so well\nAnd it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of the short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having a over such a crazy flame\nBut it'll just really get that searing nice in deep into the ... does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I didn't really think that would that be ended up quite make it ... and stealing or breathing are no longer not smart see things more like ... ...\nYeah and what's really awesome then though is once you get that really nice dark seer\nThem what you do is you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that haven't burnt so then you continue to use that to raise like you say this do and that's when you add your liquid you can add you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using and it just builds so much flavor and then you put in there and put the lid on put an oven\nAnd I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off and just server right in the pot 'cause it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift it's also a good one of those yes it's like [laughter]\nSeeing and now you're cooked food I get to eat out of it\nToo [laughter] oh yeah it was it was perfect for both of us the\nTruth like well enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to tell you did All right let's now go let's go you make it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank you\nSo we have a question from an anonymous call her\nA hopefully it's not because they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make zucchini noodles and he wants to learn how to cook was ... noodles like noodles they turned out much he when he does them any really prefer them to be more out and say I'm I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think\nMy first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do\nIs cooked some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher heat\nBecause what happens is when you have ... you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still ... eight cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan than what's going to happen is you know the stuff on the surface of the pan is cooking and getting soft and the stuff in the middle isn't quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest as divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time\nAnd get your pan ripping hot put in some nice oil maybe aromatic whatever you want to do whatever the recipe is and just give them a quick tossing them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do that until you get all you can you talk [noise]\nAll right so a little while ago we asked you all for your secret ingredients let us know what are the things that you use of you and we might have never thought to use and we have Erica on the line from Seattle right now to tell us about her hair and how are you\n[noise] I just I'm good how are you I'm well thank you so what is your secret ingredient so my secret ingredient is a new mommy outer [noise] um\nKnow flakes and ... um that are pulverized onto the very fine powder um and I've used it on things you know for a big chicken for example the typical things like burgers and meatloaf I recently did on the savory oatmeal that was phenomenal\nOh cool where do you buy this [noise]\nNo I've made it I can tell you the recipe if you'd
