to her through ... magazine and it has an eats when the editors how the entire issue voted\nAt issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written by the Senate Louis called what a southern and in this essay a miss Lewis positioned the culture of the American south and the culture the African American south in particular alongside the kind of work a day ... kitchens and also alongside music\nAnd literature and painting and other forms of art ... and for me it was this incredibly\nStriking moment as someone who was interested in food and and really desperately wanted to get involved in the work of food it was a really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture and to try to make sense of that and I never heard of that and Louis before that I loved cookbooks I Love cooking\nOn but I I had no idea who she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered some for books and I read them and fell in love with her and it was many years later that I was working with a notice is editor Judith Jones who's the editor that also published\nJulia Child in modern ... oh my gosh ... wrote an and yes the diary of Anne Frank famously edge of a ... and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author is our English writing I should say cookbook author and she published and the Lewis says most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd then interviewing Judith Jones about work\nIt became apparent to me that her book that you did with mess Lewis was a real hinge points for her that she turned away from working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who is writing very explicitly about American cuisine and culture and very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up that sort of snap to attention and pay attention moment in in Judith Jones is career of what it meant and you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and the women's movement a civil rights Vietnam War has come to an end I mean this really tremendous\nIdentity what it meant to publish a book from the perspective an African American woman about the American south of rural American South and then the perspective of home cook\nAnd then it just I think for many people who've come across that it was this really\nBeautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility and sort of unfortunately direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to Jim down your throat and and you need it to kind of be ready to receive it in her in your own time and I think for a lot of people that's come late many many decades after its original publication\nWhat do you mean by receive it and that when you were you say that came late\nWell you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a ... and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food out in the kitchen of eating alongside one another but if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day\n... this is a work of African American history in the American south of of really giving dignity to that culture as its own entity and a lot of ways that's\nSeparate from white American culture mhm\n[noise] so I I wrote a story about to lose a number of years ago\nAnd in my research ... called you up and and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I I didn't pick up before mhm\nIncluding but I think this idea of the face of the country cooking as being more with political work when you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as or just a sweet old lady yes a sweet ... writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of\nI didn't hundreds ... her her grandparents who are the people who founded the community she grew up in where in slave mhm if they were freed slaves at once that's right and\nI think if you think of that story due to imagine a story that was one of hardship and you know just trying to scrape by and\nAnd she writes about it like the most beautiful society the most beautiful community it was a life of beauty literally children are singing in the book yeah and\nI thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say hey whatever stereotypes you have of us mhm if you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine your started after all that's right and that's upper finally political thing it's\nA massive corrective I think just so much of what had been written in what continues to be written\nThat the life of the American south and black culture with in that large regional culture of large series of regional cultures that was one of just hardship and poverty and that even though these needing communities that were financially pour their life was rich\nAnd and that included down she you know if if this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it and and and things that we think that's sort of still is a luxury food meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms meant for I mean this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was\nYou know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they had created for themselves\nYeah they're they're literally making souffle isn't their kitchen literally yeah yeah that's right and there's also this fear ... to it too I think is so\nAgain maybe subtle and maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene I remember a small tropical hog killing and she describes the tradition of you know when you started the hogs in the fall and how they put up all the different parts and there's just really\nThey blow the butter like balloons and hide them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later when you\nCan you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally mhm and but also remember reading it and the way she describes the hogs after they've been slaughtered ... it almost sounds I mean the way she described hunting hanging quietly like statues\nIt's like that song strange fruit it's\nIt's almost like a Lynch scene and then I found later that when she was young there was a black man in a nearby community to hers\nWho was lynched after he had talked to a white woman and asked her to help them with their ... yeah and I have no idea if that's what she intended to be a connection but it's like now you have this many years hence understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all ... [noise]\nI'm In the reality of it I I Can't help but think that you'll miss and had those things in her mind certainly I'm On a few wrote them in that scene but yeah\nI think that's what I Am a leading to the sense that she was so unfair lynching and her ... you know that that there was incredible ... than what she presented you with\nWhether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time um and that she was going to say it's sort of quietly and many people who knew her and her as being a fairly quiet woman she often didn't say more than needed to be sad and sometimes she said nothing at all but if she was gonna open her mouth or put pen to paper\nIt was going to be with clarity it was going to be concise and she wasn't going to dart away from her intrudes on and then she was just going to sort of place it there and leave it there and and you can see that\nYou know for the beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find both yup paradox and that and I think they're in life her brilliance\nYeah incredible incredible I thank you so much\nSarah Franklin the editor of Edna Lewis at the table with an American which\nShe teaches writing at NYU and she's also working on a book Judith Jones is Lewis is legendary editor\n\nIn\n[noise] one of the Lewis his deepest friendships was with another ...
