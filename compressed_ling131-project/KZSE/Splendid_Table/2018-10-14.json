potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had around the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realized pretty quickly that you know outside of the south not a lot of people are eating sweet potato pie\nA ... is a it's a beautiful place it's on the southwestern coast there ...\nIt's tropical it's humid uh their beach towns and at this time of year it's very very hot\nAnd and tell me about this ... what are these women doing [noise]\nIt's a pilgrimage where millions of women traveled to one city to cook a dish together and that simplifying him in a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us and they're traveling to the home of this got us and her temple and a city called ... and the trains are filled with\nWomen starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to this place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride\n'em and the women are taking with them a single bag usually they have a bad that is filled with\nAll of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ... and the entire ceremony revolves around arriving to the temple arriving to the city and everyone's setting up\nAnd what they're setting up our a makeshift hearth\nOf three bricks a clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and he set up all over the city so they're you know how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow yes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million\nWow big year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to a goddess yeah that's the way that they refer to her is\nTo call our mom um she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such a mythology around all this if this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity

the rice um\nThey dress often and new clothing I was told that women are often brand new outfit just for the ceremony um and then they all gather around the hardest that they've made the city actually provides the bricks for the ... and and sometimes the pots\nAnd they they wait until\nThe signal from the temple comes in a signal is that um the priest and the temple lights a fire\nAnd that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then there are also volunteers running around and helping to light heart so all at once at the same exact moment all around the city there speakers that women light a fire\nAnd they all start cooking so which actually really incredible about this is this now you're you're walking around the city all of the smoke is all over the place and everything smells like burn rice and fire and coconut bark\nAnd these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes and they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment\n[noise] [noise]\nThey're really cooking so tell us a it's a rice porridge yes\nSo they basically they start off they have a a clay pot over an open fire 'em they add water they wait for the water to boil and then they have this specific kind of race\nA partial has left on so it has a ... hue and they scatter rice into the pot usually in three handfuls\nAnd then the they wait for the for the pot to boil and part of the ceremony at the ... must boil over to satisfy that got us so when you look around all of these pots are bubbling over the sort of steamy was beginning to be a rice porridge\nAnd they eat it then they do so they they spend time cooking it so that the rice gets soft like any rice dish would and then at the end\nAnd they add all of the seasonings and sweet flavors and it depends on where the women are from some you know some women say that you have to ... because he is a a purifying a sort of symbol um many women as ginger there's always coconut there's always cardamom there's always\nA what's called ... which is an honor find palm sugar and uh at the end they they cover their pots once it's cooked they cover it with a banana leaf and they wait for priests to come around this can take hours instead of in the interim time they eat lunch they sit around and they rub each other's shoulders a nap\nAnd then when the priest comes they all get behind their hearts again they take off the banana leaf and the priest comes in scattered holy water over there they're pots\nAnd then they're free to eat it and this moment is so beautiful because it's the thing that I've been waiting for all year this is a sort of symbol of feeding themselves feeding the gods feeding their families\nAnd they all take a spoonful they taste each other's pong dollar they feed each other and then they put the banana leave back over top they pack the pots away and they leave\n[noise] the fleet such a beautiful

a credibly beautiful but uh what are we talking about\nWell here's the problem by uh we live in a very hot place or do we get ... like ... or ... or like eighty five degrees and that's what we put on a sweater\nOr it it's it's very hot and very humid all the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything and uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even solved not not so much because salt nature preservation but just to get the dry\nAnd a ... and so we we really are are very careful with a you know how we store things and one day we were having a party and a friend came a friend had just come from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto a huge chunk like\nThree pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of ... ... it's just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it ... around him and uh we were doing\nChunk [noise] and so in the party at my wife says why should we cut the what we do is sit knowledge to put it in the freezer for now ... put it in the freezer and it's been there [noise] and ah anyway we have no idea what to do once we get frost it because we cannot possibly\nThree pounds of prosciutto before which foil and I totally committed\nTo your to your suggestions because this morning knowing you're speaking to my what pulled a free ... is currently defrosting refrigerator\n[laughter] oh wow so you're okay there's no turning back yeah there's no [laughter]\nYou've got you've got the guardian not on the frozen previewed a I see this\nIs an interesting problem I Am honored that you would trust me with it I Hope I don't feel you have to say I've never actually had to deal too much with a giant frozen block appreciate them before that's\nA that's neither one of ... in some ways a a blessing problem now have to tell you given the fact that it was frozen in a home freezer I don't know how well it's going to defrost meaning if my questions to\nYeah you know if you flash freeze meats and things of that nature in a in a you know industry of freezer that can work because it freezes it so quickly\nThat the ice crystals um stay pretty small but just like ... and then they're then they're in a home freezer because it takes a while but ice crystals start to grow and they and they start to poke through the cell walls and so you may find that in a week some juice\nAnd you may find that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be quite as um for more you know sort of to some as it was before or maybe not as delicate\nThat said if it's not totally be frosted what I might think about doing is\nYou have a a deli or if you haven't done we slice yourself or if you know a deli nearby mainland you'd consider running\nThe thin while it's still a partially frozen so you ... slicing thin you know packages or however many slices you ... you might have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase about too much damage\nThat said the other thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful texture as when it was you know originally\nA fresh per se um but so I think about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask dessert cooking solution because I I thought the same thing that it would probably wants to Austin even if it were sliced up it wouldn't be quite the same\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in in ways where maybe your wrapping it around something maybe your wrapping it around his piece of chicken you wrapping it around and the and then you can sort of secret so you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise]\nUm [noise] you can cut it into chunks and use it to do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a salty cured ham if you're if you're not in position to be able to enjoy it and it sort of like silky thin sliced a state\n[noise] no I assumed that since sliced phase of it slices over it would be something\n[laughter] I Wonder even why\nEven thought maybe it was just putting the whole thing in the slow cooker and sort of raising the whole ...\nYou know I have never done that but I is that thing right where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose\n[laughter] so hey\nShy and I'm sure someone in Italy with like you know rolling their grave when they heard someone done this to appreciate but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure the texture and all the flavor on a beautiful cure flavor is going to be there so if you do that and us look\nSupport for NPR's brought you bought a law firm of Inskeep intellectual property group with offices in Minnesota and Los Angeles Inskeep IP Group aims to help companies leverage the power of patents to protect their innovation you didn't find out more than ...\n... ... ... ... you know in the in the American south they had these um cured hands they do exactly that with its cured it aired dried and then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slices needed thin you took the whole I Am and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out you might save some of that\nLiquid I'm used to I mean that would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze that and use that as a stock or is that a a flavor base rather stocks and then eat the meat\n[noise] you know I think I I liked I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it or you know as a flavor and has served for vegetable dishes and maybe\nSauces and things like that I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a dish called ... and one of the things it's like a big giant stew and one of the things they should do is put a big piece of pork belly you know not like not like sliced bake it a big square of it into which at them\nAs a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish for the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so I kinda like that idea of mine yeah different things that you're\nCutting it in half and using some of it for chunks for added to the vegetables stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and see what happens\nYeah yeah yeah well if you cut it up nice and small you can start that in a pan um you know render that maybe you can add a little more olive oil or or or other fats in the pan when they get a little bit nice and brown scrambled eggs in that and that would be\nSo delicious and you know I was like you\nSomething that's maybe one or two other ingredients you know just really kind of feature that flavor 'cause I mean it's a beautiful flavor whatever you do with it thanks so much for listening all the way from ... new\nBook thanks so much
