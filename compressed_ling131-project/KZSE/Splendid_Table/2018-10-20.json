up so you can hear it again [noise]\nAfter about two years neither of us had had a break more than one day a week for ages and Susan I'm decided that she can take a trip and go to India and uh I'll never forget it the night before she left we were having a\nLittle kind of like a\nFake fight or a race thing we were racing\nGr and that's how it's worked out which I think I Want and she didn't win because well I like through my arm up in the air as in a gesture and she had a knife in the air and I cut the tendon and my finger\nSo I had to go to the hospital and get a cast and she was like oh maybe I Can't go and I said no no you got to go you got to go and so then there was me and Jose Luis and [laughter] doing everything for those two weeks ago she was gone but what happened is when she came home\nShe was gone and how to put about you know four or five Indian dishes on the menu we did the core is like little vegetable freighters we did a tuna pancake we made doll and curry and\nDid a shot navy and right and\nIt was really like immediately we just incorporated into the menu so it was all these rustic French things and a bunch of Indian\nThing to do that and and I had been so inspired over there by all the flavor profiles and just that it was such an interesting 'cause he's all vegetarian ... it was the place where I I was staying on an Asher more a friend of mine lab I spent the whole time in the kitchen with\nHis cooks and all the women were you know not allowed in the main little kitchen they're basically we're just three holes in a cement block that you know you put a fire underneath the but all the women were out on the porch grinding spices making all the different bread than it was so\nInspiring that it just was something I felt like we have to put these things on the menu and then\nAbout a year later Mary Sue took her first trip she didn't cut me right before she laugh\n[laughter] she took her first trip than to Thailand\nAnd had a very similar experience\nYeah my uncle was there and he landed up so I could work in the kitchen of the hotel where he was and it would have had a big very very authentic type of fate and the woman who cooked it was actually the cook for the king and queen of Thailand for ten\nDidn't speak any English and I didn't speak any time but you know we got along immediately and we cook together all day every day for three weeks and then same thing I came home and we were\nYou know time Ellen salad and Chinese sausage salad entire red curry duck and I'm scallops and\nOh my gosh we have pictures that are just amazing and so then you know that our menu them became had cats who may and then duck red curry and then potato budget with mint cilantro chutney and then\nYou know put those are and so it was a very mixed like that and one day the rigatoni that we bought from a person who made fresh pasta and delivered it came and it was like three or four inches long instead of the normal inch and a half\nAnd we were like what happened I said oh we had a problem with the cutter and blah blah blah blah blah and then I you know we were we this is houses and and I kind of work together we're in the kitchen going oh you remember those chicken breast we we've got to use them today no matter what we can't let him go another day okay well let's just\nLet's make a sausage out of that chicken breast with a lot of ... stuff it into the rigatoni and then I don't know what do you think oh let's just try with cream and parmesan and anyway that rigatoni became like a signature dish that everybody ordered and so we had to tell the pasta company can you make our rigatoni long all of them [laughter]\nAnd literally it became one of those favorite dishes and some of the inspiration comes that way of trying to like get rid of things that we think we need to get rid of\nAnd other dish or the other is free she comes from people that work for us it someone whose mother made something when they were growing up in a tiny town in Mexico like our measurement bananas or you see something\nIn the market and when we first decided to turn city cafe into a little tiny Mexican restaurant called border grill we went to Mexico for three weeks we drove around in a little tiny VW Bug and we you know asked a trillion questions of everybody we could\nDo something we'd never seen before we would buy it and then we would take it and ask people what it is how do you use it with this chili that I remember we discovered Chipotle eat chilies and we'd nobody nobody knew what it should probably was more or less a chain of restaurants and it was Nineteen eighty five yeah\nYeah I mean we didn't you know that that first trip to Mexico we stay well our little kitchenette city cafe was myself and Mary Sue ended in a dishwasher\nBut then eventually we hired like a ... student who came in you know probably wanted like Eighteen dollars now is that no no no we'll hire you for like five dollars an hour or whatever ... whatever minimum wage yeah and I said okay so he came to work but his name was ... and\nWe loved him and we ended up going to Mexico City and staying with his parents in their home and his mom took us\nEvery day for a few days to the market this is our first chip and we'd like bought everything that we didn't know what it was and come home and cook with her all day so it was how we started to learn about\nMexican ingredients and and we fell in love with this cuisine and then we did this driving around\nWhere we just like ate everything we wrote our first menu in the Volkswagen bug when we came back we opened up and when we opened up with this you know Mexican menu and literally we had to take our notebook out like with the pa new Joe's or with the ... as we couldn't remember what they even were\nYou know called and so we were constantly looking at are now but but that was sort of the beginning of border grill that was the beginning\nWow you know I keep thinking about the time frame of this was in the early to mid eighties this was not stuff that was happening and shut the restaurants and\nYou know people starting today have such a different frame of reference and I've read that

of your job and that is you get to go to all the winners of the Julia Child award and bring back something from them to display in the museum so I wouldn't know what\nWhat's that like I mean what's that like standing in front of someone who's going through their stuff and you know they're thinking\nOh man I'm going to be in the Smithsonian\nFor ever [laughter]\nYeah it is a cool part of my job I Will admit that\nIt has been different for each of the winter to tell you the truth [noise] um you know for a jacket and it was something that we talked about\nAnd then it led from one thing to another um for retail is it was also very different and I was able to speak with him and his staff and to really talk about it quite a lot of time\nAnd by the time they came back with a very wonderful list\nFor certain things that uh stood out to um ... donated a collection of menus and as you probably know he is an artist and these menu or works of art and show both of course the menu items but also he is women see as well as photographs in documents and a few kitchen tools [noise]\nFrom Rick bail us ah we were able to collect his original field notes from his research in Mexico in the Nineteen seventies they are just fantastic because he was a an anthropologist and keeping incredible notes as he traveled around different regions of Mexico\nAnd the field notes are handwritten and then midway through they are typed\nAnd he realized that he really wanted to type is notes halfway through the trip so we bought a little typewriter and he donated the typewriter as well cool I'm from Danny Myer we collected around his concept of enlightened hospitality that really shaped and and drove his groundbreaking restaurants in in New York\nSo we have again another document this notebook of his conversations with people that he was asking for guidance developing Union Square\nIt's quite a diverse collection as you can see we're really looking at again the biographies of people and their particular stories [noise]\nUm this year I'm it's wonderful to have been able to go to Los Angeles and to speak with Mary Sue militant and Susan vinegar about their you know their stuff but\nWe don't really start with the stuff we always start with the story of who they are and um how they got to where they are how they got into the restaurant business and what those early years were like what the struggles may have been what were the challenges and\nHow did they land on you know this very successful\nSo for me it really starts with the story of learning about who the people are what the big themes might be in their in their histories and then to show up and talk to them about what that might look like what is the\nKind of the the kernel of of their their own history [noise] um so I was delighted to be able to go to Los Angeles at the end of July and to meet them in border grill [noise]\nThey had gone through their stuff ahead of time and had pulled out just boxes and bags and piles of things and\nYou know to a curator that's just you know that's catnip rolling it and I'm looking at that and they had a pretty good sense of what we were after and\nHad come up with some great material so what is it what is it for donors are your from your from which is yeah [laughter] okay that's where we watching\n'em we are in the middle of collecting this material I'm too big boxes arrived a few weeks ago and in one box was Mary Sue ... knife bag um that she hacked\nFor competing on top chef masters we oh she did in twenty loving\nAnd you know this is an object that we don't have anything quite like it in the collections yet and they're at all was um you know all beautifully arranged their six nights forced bachelors your chopsticks scissors Lester is all this stuff\nIs very very cool and what about Susan Susan ...\nYes well the two of them of also donated some of the dishes from\nTheir early restaurant a city cafe in Los Angeles and these are just so special they're they're beautiful very colorful and they are um shapes that reflect the cuisine that they were really featuring in city cafe\nI'm a nice sized eight or ten pieces [noise]\nUm and to come to the museum we will have a ... um you know Mary Sue ensues and\nWe're very into color very early on and so we have a pink chefs coat\nI'm with border grill embroidered on the cough I'm\nWhich again shows how they're very cognizant of the fact when they are doing something on television that they can also show that border grill part of the camera angle on which is is wonderful [noise]\nUm and then we've got you know the archives are always you know very very interesting to go through I mean there's paper and then their paper and\nFor us there were these little notebooks that didn't look like much but of course when you pick them up and you look at that and then you realize oh my gosh this is their first trip to Mexico you know trying to really research some of the color the roots of dishes that they were interested in for their restaurants\nSelf little no books like that not everyone from India and for Thailand sort of cool and you know this is where you can sort of imagine as a researcher looking through this and\nSort of seeing the thought process of somebody who is curious about your food traditions in other parts of the world and cooks and and people in other parts of the world and to then think about bringing that back for their restaurants in Los Angeles yeah\nIt's so cool too because I imagine you know [laughter] so I was Twenty years in the future now Thirty years and then you know the people were going to win it then you're going to be like hey can you send me the attacks were texting yourself on your door to you [laughter]\nBut let me out here we are also doing though is you're going through essentially somewhat which as you said someone's life story through\nThe objects that they have held in Britain and um\nIt is kind of um and in fact you will see people bring that stuff out and then it's there and then when we come and we start handling it gently of course but handling it in and talking to them about it\nYou know the the stories are triggered and when they start telling the story the meaning is made a parent of what this object represents to them and their and their lives and what they care about\nAnd there are these emotional moments when somebody will you know have that look on their face\nAnd we always tell people look you know it's your choice to donate something to the collection and if you're not ready you're not ready for 'em so we don't force people but um but those emotional stories are the things that we document along with collecting the actual objects", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "20"}
