Am indigenous I Am also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ... and to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to be in the causes of everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves and so\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote Mexicans coming in from the border these are these are indigenous people\nAnd this is their land\nWhat were your mom and dad speaking to you and you know looks on their meter\nProud like being a war was a message like look on Sunday or you're in New York or through and through however you want to define yourself\nYou know I was I grew up with a very strong sense of patriotism\nA very strong sense as we are American I also was raised you are ... like through and through and so I grew up like the music I grew up around was Hector level ... cruise and then hip hop in you know growing up around the\nBrand your favorite hip hop artist would be a boy so hard\nI grew up around like public enemy and knives Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like yeah fat job do you have big pond\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes people say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform is still intersection off and to me it's not even that we're trying it's this is who we are and so what what it means to be American and what we grew up and like how we grew up around these values was my dad\nWould go visit family in Puerto Rico every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg\nWhat really yeah you mean like for the weekend well I mean we would take a little family vacation and it would be like ... and you were young yeah those are really good to places where we went on family ... she cried [laughter]\nIt was colonial Williamsburg I'm going to see all that [laughter]\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough you know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking\nUm and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI think I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been that's a process but I had a friend come over a couple of months ago\nAnd there was a magazine that had my face on the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of political ideas of twenty teens and she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel\nLike this isn't my ... this is an island\nBut we're laughing at it and she says that's what you are you're an idea now\nAnd I felt like I had to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that maybe this through an interesting question how are you managing your ego\n'cause I mean the truth is is that you're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games but it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\nIt is and if anything there are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary\nIn my brain

Hassan so a few months ago we brought you a story about how young Latinos are navigating higher education and we looked at how one university Oregon State is trying to combat the troubling trend of Latinos\nA couple of weeks ago we looked at the future of warehouse jobs many of which are filled by young Latinos and ... and we wondered whether or not these jobs offer a path\nTo the middle class [noise] all these stories were part of a partnership with the community service society of New York a nonprofit that among other things conducts demographic research\nTo help in their mission of fighting poverty in New York City their data helped bring you these stories and today I'm sitting down with lives are ... he's the organizations director of youth policy to talk about some of that data that they've gathered about Latinos and education in New York City over the last year\n... ... ...\n... I think lives are when I first met you you were like probably the geek you were like look I Love data I Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data and numbers and there are a lot of you out there in the world [laughter] absolutely\nI think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about on real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the ...\nThe particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing about ten years ago to see the terrific show in heights\nLike Washington Heights subject of the day you wake up and I got this little\nBecause actually grew up in Washington Heights where the shows about and it's a Broadway musical by ...\nI mean I thought Josh gene so\nKnow it's a terrific show and discipline and all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in\nWithin Washington Heights Dominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community\nAnd actually never heard sauce until I went to college so I started thinking about law I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map there is a diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself I wondered if it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within\nLatino Americans in between the New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the\nDate a little bit to see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are real differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the use policy field that I work and\nSo what did you find what surprised\n... working in New York City schools and it new policy field so much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that\nYou've got three really distinct communities of Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and the largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities both ways to make them great and then ways that we can support them to be even better\nI really I Love this particular point\nThat Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other ...\nWhat's up with that it's really interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised and a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some other groups but Latino non Latino\nOne thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group actually compare to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origins and what we find\nIs that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the culture pervades all the different groups in the school so the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really provides to lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture\nAnd among women in particular which is real bright spot\n\nNow in comparison to Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans both in New York and other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school and the college going culture may not be a strong\n... still there's a whole conversation Ron desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical thing but what it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of making it into smaller bite sized pieces is that a conversation that is being had regarding Latinos and electing the United states increasingly\nI think we're seeing the value of diversity in our analysis and now I think the next step is we're such a diverse community within Latinos how do we really show the differences within them and a show the needs and strengths of different communities and we're really on an exciting frontier as people start to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Latino USA", "city": "Rochester",
