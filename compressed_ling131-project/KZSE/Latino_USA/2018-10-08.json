non supposed to run [laughter] don't ... this is a forklift\nIs part of the joke to me to stop the it says\nIt's like a video of like people playing you post on Youtube videos of themselves playing games yeah and then they other people I Love to watch yeah I don't understand why but yes yeah it's like a whole thing I don't get it either but like this has seven hundred thousand views and it's just like this dude\nTower and like driving a forklift around and trying to pick stuff up and like put other places yeah but what I think it's funny too and I want to show us like if you look at the comments\nSome people are like giving tip so like I drive a forklift and they don't go super fast but it feels like they do when you're in close quarters in warehouses maybe thirty five to forty miles per hour someone else's like keep your forks low to the ground when traveling like under six inches high prevents loads from tumbling off the forks I'm a forklift driver\nGot all these people they commenting like actually drive forklifts forklifts and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of jobs and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot of our future jobs involve forklifts and that's because one of the fastest\nGrowing industries in our country today is the industry of moving and storing stuff especially stuff that we order on line\n[noise]\nWe're going to start our show by diving into one of the fastest growing parts of the American economy it's warehouses [noise]\nWarehouses hardly in between space that all of this stuff from cat food to fuzzy socks flows through on the way to us and the industry is exploding\nThe one team then\nObama visited an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee and again\nIt's a particular focus on getting a better bargain for the middle class we've invited\nFrom the worst recession since the great depression at a golf millions of Americans or jobs or the ... ... what is it was a lady live the long term Malaysia has been happening when it comes to middle class at your\nObama talked about bringing back manufacturing jobs but he was also there in Chattanooga to highlight job growth in other sectors Amazon had just announced that it was hiring thousands of workers for its warehouses nationwide\nNow over the next two years experts are saying that the warehousing industry needs to hire over four hundred thousand workers just to keep up with the growth and e commerce so the jobs of tomorrow are actually we're housework\nAnd many of those jobs will be held by Latinos and let the nuts currently in about forty percent of Eighteen to thirty four year olds working in the where housing business are Latinos\nBut are these jobs that are taking over at a really good jobs I mean are they really a pass to his stable middle class life the way that manufacturing jobs once were Latino USA producer Soviet police car is going to explore the

before the break we are from high school students who were learning to drive forklifts and how to organize inventory in order to prepare them from working in warehouses\nNo our producers of yet but he's a car is taking us to a real warehouse where these young people might work one day\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIf you remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over by the highway and it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses is Amazon's\nI reached out to them to see if I could come take a look around and they said yes\nAnd visiting the facility gave me a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increase automation [noise]\nI entered the building bears justice wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway\nAnd there are signs everywhere that say no photos once the guard left me and I realize it's free time tons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners they have\nUnder our feet\nWe also have way more than a hundred times\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to four yeah who introduced herself as a community specialist I'm not\nSure what that means in fact there's a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associates entry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase fulfilling our customer\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground like roads which is good because\nI'm going to offer a quick [noise]\nThat actually drove past us\nWe will be another one in a minute we call them ADD\nAG these automatic guided vehicles basically it's like a forklift loaded up with items but it's totally a man and it follows a map of the warehouse floor programmed into it\nIt just wishes by us\n\nEverything in this warehouse is yellow and gray except for another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange when you think of\nRobots as an ally but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon [noise] they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room but they're square and on top of each of them is a set of shelf which holds item\nOperate in this\nSo this is how it works say somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it on line once they do that that's one of the item gets picked\nYour notice on the screen provided them\nI just\nWant it is how many they need to\nPick the back massager a second worker calls the orange robots over retrieved massager from the shelf and then puts it on the yellow track kind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt\nSet in place that we're going to go and\nPack station it's what it sounds like basically the massage or comes in on the yellow trait and the worker pack said into box no robots here this is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy ...\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo stuff she's seen someone order\nI asked her how many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about it the grief\nYou could do that we were so hours a day\nWorkers normally do for ships so weak so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week\nSo the very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping lately all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nShipping label is created and gently place to err on top of all\nThat sound you hear on the air is placing it on this and I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\n\n... so the robots Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two\nThey're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly wage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands\nOf Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says he stickers are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom breaks\nAnd that workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nResponded that they didn't recognize these allegations as accurate they also said they coach people who aren't making the quotas and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm an Amazon I asked learn about this\nYou know we don't have and power over light individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great work place with great team members and great benefits\nA consequence of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voice concern\n[noise] [noise] so without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are these the jobs that the graduates of Patterson high school really want I head down to Los Angeles to place reckoning with these questions [noise]\n\nThe warehouse workers resource center is located in Long Beach on one side of the room is a wall photos of workers protesting on the other side\nIs one of the only organizations in the country that advocates for warehouse workers they trained people on things like wage theft and how to fall for workers' comp for injuries\nAt the warehouse center of the day I visit is Wayne wealth and he's twenty five and he drove forklifts for local warehouses\nWorking in a way as good as ... you know at your muscles\nBeing in warehouses for the last seven years after he dropped out of college to start helping his family his mom got sick and he helps out paying rent and bills the biggest problem for him though is the lack of consistent hours the Wayne doesn't work directly for the warehouse he worked for a temp agency\nAnd the agency is supposed to have him working at the warehouse forty hours a week but\nSometimes they don't want them sometimes they do last week the only woman on the so\nTwain sometimes lines up at five AM in the morning first shift at six AM after being called in and still gets turned away sometimes the only one full week a month doing shows me his phone\nHe tells me photos to the sniffles or okay so\nYou'd have senior manager in the work tomorrow he says not tomorrow say can I at least worth friday like you know to me anyway and he does not just me Thursday night of the things that are in Texas I worked in a while he says no\nYeah but some of that it's a constant threat of that basically yeah kind\nAnd after moving up and getting off the temp hamster wheel green says he's never even seen a way to apply directly for a full time job at the warehouse that he works at\nBasically warehousing companies use temp agencies because it's cheaper temp agencies provide a steady stream of labor to warehouses that don't have to worry about recording workers or managing them they take money out of each worker's hourly wage and joins us as a temp agency doesn't tell them how much it could be a dollar ten dollars they don't know and\nThe lack of work or a steady paycheck makes workers less likely to speak up because they don't want to risk sacrificing the hours they do have ... case he says he'd like to go back to school maybe become a writer but that's not his plan right now\nOh I ended up in D. C. is weak and I'm sure that there are people are saying I'm hearing bird dog again and I'm feeling uncomfortable is it about confronting jumping taking on being confrontational no it's not it's not about being confrontational it's about seeking connection\nIt's about allowing elected officials to remember who they represent to connect their humanity to your humanity\n\nI was asking myself that question of whether I wanted to tell my story or not and in that moment I just went with it and he said you know I I was five\nHe was Fifteen and I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents who either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do that information they never did anything so they just understood the lesson that\nWe are not believed and these boy understood the lesson that boys will be boys and I don't want my children to learn that lesson\n\nI Want to believe that in our country we actually\nListened to survivors and it was a very painful moment I cried after because I realized oh my God maybe my father will hear it these way maybe my mother who hearing these way [noise]\nThen [noise] it didn't reach them but then on friday I texted me that\nInteraction with flake and he said you might hear something and then use I Want you to know that I Am okay and he said I'm Sorry I was not able to protect you and they said to him it was not your fault and it's not my fault and they feel very supported by you\nI didn't tell them I started because I didn't want him and other people who love me to have to hold that being and I'm not doing it alone like I'm doing it with all these women I I feel so much in community\nWith thousands of women I have never met but whose stories I deeply deeply understand\nWhen you see what happened in the moment with Senator Flake how do you connect that to the kind of activism that you've been doing and developing on immigration how do those two worlds come together in that moment for you\nA lot of the conversation about a survivors has centered or\nThe stories of women kind of without talking about the rest of their experience of who we are I can separate me being a woman from being let me now from being an immigrant from being a mother and now accepting and embracing\nThese other part of my identity as a survivor I think the the history of these countries the history of the struggle for inclusion\nOf morals us and the promise of freedom\nIn some ways the the act of bird dog named Senator Flake people will say it is your most overt political act in some deeper human ways it's the
