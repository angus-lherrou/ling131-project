in Albuquerque\nHere's Tristan reef lived in Mexico\nIt's a bright spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trail with my partner ... he's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now\nHave this do you want to have a baby silence he turns around and I see that he is laughing at me this is the stupidest idea you've ever had\nNo I don't want to have a baby\nIn his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of helium Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just trying to get that teased a freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nTo a baby\nThis isn't some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender\nAh for me that means that I was born female uh I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body a and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem um and there was a name\nTo um but most importantly it meant that um I could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy um which is what I did um [noise]\n\nUh I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nUh and it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to happy beautiful children we knew it was possible or but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and if it was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns a and I just hope that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer [noise]\nUm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started to think maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel the peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nUh [noise]\nI had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant\nIt made me and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant and it was going to be a baby you know but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things that get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of a baby [noise]\nI'm Haley unwind we'd been toddlers when they came to live with that so I didn't know what to do with a baby\nUm and then my body started to change really quickly I'm an all of those ah markers of femininity everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on in my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like this are my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the things that it can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nA and wait around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there is also joy and love and and resilience and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um\nFor me to be pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone still reads that um CNN a Washington\nPost people magazine pregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm\nTo be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trams um a lady once told me that she adopted her knees too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve well also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly Harry woman\nAnd that I was going to give birth to a monster\nAnd then one woman\nSent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby\nBecause ...\nTo someone like you I was six months pregnant when I read that message", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "20"}
