we're all talking to each other on the Internet at the same time\nAnd that happened to me in two thousand and two not two thousand two as you remember what the wild west days of the Internet or there was no Twitter there was no YouTube very few people were on Facebook so it was really really hard to go viral back then uh and I say that so you'll be impressed [noise]\nSo and you got to do I was a college student at the University of Maryland and um\nIt was really hard time in my life I was sad all the time uh and I was tired all the time and I didn't really make any friends on campus I just went to class and I didn't join any activity but just\nOccasionally were right movie reviews for the college newspaper and I did that mostly because I really like free things um they will go home and I was a direct my parents' basement and for work I worked at the local the Baltimore Sun the local paper\nUm in their subscription complaints department um\nAnd so people would call me if they didn't get their paper delivered in the morning I'm sometimes he would call me if they had a complaint about an editorial I couldn't really do much about that and sometimes people just call me because they were lonely um and so we go in and five and talk on the phone until noon and then I Would go to campus um and then I Would go back home\nAnd that was my life so I went viral in February um I was in

good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nSo these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them because I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and\nMy mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and ah in Chinese bakeries my dad were six days a week as a construction worker and when he come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his back\nWhile I'm\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American\n[noise] and so I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China and I asked\nWho are rooting for [noise]\nI joined ... of course\nChina but we're here in America I thought\nI couldn't ask that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause the rockets right but\nI found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was excited to watch a PBS documentary about becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nSeen three people who ever looked\nMe Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAndme on line a cartoon character [noise]\nSo I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding ... signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identity their life they were marching for this man named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin and\nThe man who was being said that\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers crisis in Detroit\nWhere Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their jobs they fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest wants his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine X people\nAre now saying if this could happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups
