was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables and I got just dirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man\nThat I felt war would be\nExciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and to know books and pens and a few thousand dollars and I went to Bosnia during the civil war is arguable to try to learn to be a war reporter\n\nThat I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint by it's also way more than you bargained for\nFor example this the first time I saw a dead body there wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying mores of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl who's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by surprise military forces are and ... they took her up to a field above a talent goes to a record\nAnd they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summers hot\nAnd the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out the front lines that it was\nA ... getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop\nAnd we just staring straight ahead while they are\nAnd\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole that the bullet comes out of\nYou know one point a guy ... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes well all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was attorney the inside those holes and there are so small\nThe thickness of a pencil and attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us\nAnd we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze\nIn combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd ...\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan a postcard Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face and\nYou have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so\nFive four hundred meters five hundred meters the first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at because the sounds of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later\nYes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy the boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right now what's the mass on\nThat angle you don't even want to think about it um\nAnd then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags and our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up under the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap and he grabs Sufi throws my camera to me it feels like bullet proof vest grabs his stuff is throwing a mode of soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I started shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very\nVery brave a lot braver than me um\nHe was also really kind of
