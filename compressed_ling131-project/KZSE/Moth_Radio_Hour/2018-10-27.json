war\nIt was a girl was sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by surprise military forces are and ... they took her up to a field above a talent goes to a record\nAnd they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summers hot\nAnd the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to die to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines that it was\nA ... getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got in a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop\nAnd we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nTried to get ready I was hollow\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole that the bullet comes out of\nYou know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was attorney inside those holes and they're so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back

hitting the sandbags smacking ended everything I was paralyzed by some sandbags and our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting a tax on three
