as a public defender right\nI did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating\nFrom law school and what was what was the idea behind it you thought okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise] that's right\nAnd I like lots of people had no idea what was going on and I'm going to undergo system and my daughter in law school [noise] um I joined a criminal defense clinic at NYU and step into Manhattan criminal court\nAnd never was able to look away again this is Robyn Steinberg [noise] what I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passes project\nUm and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts is deeply deeply defined by class in by race\nAnd every one of my clients as hard as I could but definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities here's more from Robin Steinberg on the stage and\nRead 'em ... so fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution and yet\nIs addicted to imprison us from slavery and mass incarceration it always has that we all know the shocking numbers the United states incarcerated for more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night and America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete jail cells who have not been convicted of anything these mothers and\nAnd daughters are there for one reason and one reason only they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom and that price is called male\nHow much does it generally cost to post bail so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount in their own discretion I have seen it as low as a hundred dollars\nFor the people that we represent on the clients that we see bail is typically under five thousand dollars but that is way beyond the reach of most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nIt's inconceivable to lots of Americans that you can't just go to an ATM machine and pull at five hundred dollars but that's the reality for most people coming through the criminal legal system\n[noise] so if you are charged with crime and um\nI'd much in the future if you can't post bail you're you're stuck in a jail\nThat's correct ... said if you can't pay your balance you are going to have to wait until one or two things happens you're either going to plead guilty to go home the other possibility is that you demand you're hearing or trial and that weight\nTuesday partly cloudy highs of the mid

better serve non human animals like apes here Steven wise to [noise]\nLike have you look at this pencil [noise] it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing [noise]\nSo we're books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things now I can\nI can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James model is and who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes they're legal thing [noise]\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nBut well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being it at the time of slavery\nAnd the person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men or actually\nFreeman or persons but slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be the person\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons like it is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal writing [noise]\nIf you can live in these recent changes\nSupport

R. go dot com\nIn eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defended defenseless and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless that billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your\nDream that was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that D\nIs the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals you came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and after he got\nThere James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because to an Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibility to Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the anti marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and the demand is any issue a common law written the heaviest corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd he said this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the dictators required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so Mansfield ...\nWithout the Saudi not Jane Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have your support person James his body was brought in by the captain the ship\nThere were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support in the order James free at that moment James Summers that underwent a legal trans substantiate the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walk then but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers that of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James Emerson we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention to court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious\nThat they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on an army filed a hundred and sixty pages of affidavits and we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to being slaves is something that grinds against it\nStep in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you wanted to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nOnce we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could identify who are being held captive in the state of New York and where were they being held captive\nBecome a member today it's quick and easy

efforts to improve human health\nThe Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise and on the show today ideas about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them\nThere's so I I Would make it voluntary once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random checks of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then for those who were still interested in that you\nDo a second random selection as I was interested in making sure you actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you had gender bounce you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be\nSo completely different uh but so much better from my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of a government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this element of self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John out of some people\nI'm not saying I'm Sorry I'm like it's got to the galaxy guy at Douglas Adams act with us it's just I just got my dog of atoms saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's fallen to ... you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hands out for two years of that\nSchools probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected\nAnd one randomly selected in fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first uh how many in the world to instigate a one elected chamber in one school tuition chamber once with fishing buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians\nBusy back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need to have for today but uh but this is a path to old is the idea [noise]\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament's tried to say to your friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nRely jerky what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling box the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be the perfect of costs not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nWe have our strategy a and that is yes\nIt was happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to\nA sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second buddies selected by association that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle is to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try that\nYes uh yeah it does it I'm not I think it will be easy a political changes every ... seats\nAre especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I went to innovate on to try something new I think our system is broken\nAnd unknown to see a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find is full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas that hacking\nHow did you even start to think about what you wanted to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is the fact Mario he's a legal advocate\nThis last year getting ... who has this book between facts and norms and he says\nDemocracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to do it\nAnd we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as the kind of\nThe thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand and real life on the other hand between faction norms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there's a huge gap oftentimes with people who need those rules the most have never even heard of them and um\nThe systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nOr both\nBegan to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law back to the people\nHere seem like Mario on the head stage\n[noise] I Want to tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none the\nRubbish from a community of hurts people included out on the western coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nThen Twenty years later the same company goes to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nIndia is got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company had violated many of them\nJust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears Ravi says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water they get\nRobbie has appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\n[laughter] he said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing them to decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gates of that factory with a bucket of petrol in his head intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing to ignore it\nRight now in Sierra Leone in Cambodia in Ethiopia farmers are being controlled into putting their stumped prints on fifty year lease agreements sending
