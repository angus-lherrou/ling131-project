dairy my heart at wounded knee Dudley dismaying you put it is because your reservation to leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point when did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms Toni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared it Indian lands and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair and I don't want our dealings with a Caucasian and having us this land nearby off the following treated real purchased subtlety traveling for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of doom from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nJust as we go down there the whole the whole court was covered with the FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nThe care than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present to the government they one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timbre in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't talked to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ... one of Nixon's guys back man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to joined that care of and\n[noise] and then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice\nThat is right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see that he killed [noise] kinds come violence might happen to be committed [noise]\nBeen a number of very high profile\nMurder of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge\nAnd in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or missed\nAwful and so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\n[noise]\n\nYou say you had a very complicated feelings about it\nI did aim activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people the troubled government at Pine Ridge was very against this stick Wilson the German the Pine Ridge was interested in mostly in staying in power\nHaving everything stolen from us\nIndian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and I think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so in my mind\nIt's the story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank you

parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front and there's even a term for this phenomenon Indians who was the ... [laughter]\nAnd you say that India and the things he adds them and German nationalism actually share similar routes\nGo hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds that Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were either under military occupation or had been forced to become allies of Napoleon\nSo nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation miss\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire interesting\nOne of the very few sources describe these tribes as honest loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as decadent and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen ... early Nineteen century French philosopher Jones or who are so used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temperament was akin to that of the noble Savage\nExactly entered around notions off resistance freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland\nWhich throughout the nineteenth century became a root off of blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the late Nineteen century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat's right so everything seems to lead to Carla ... and his famous\nCouple of characters the German immigrant and adventure old had her hand and his Apache friend written into\nThe farthest west he actually got was the Niagara falls [laughter] way after he wrote his novels in the early Eighteen nineties\nHe claims that he based old shatter hand on himself so named because he could not get ... out with one explosive punch exactly Apache Chief then too\nOther factor among the German public right\nYes he is an ... an incredible Native American chief because he never hangs out with his own people [laughter] he's always out there by himself looking for white people you can help\nAnd Carl my made him exotic enough to fit into the frame of the adventure\nBut as some scholars described it to you and it also seems to be a very good German [laughter] because he has his character trait that their German bourgeoisie or supposed to strive towards like honesty\nBravery industry is in is\nThese novels had a very long life was Hitler\nYet it is that that ... late in the war when there was hardly any paper left Hitler allocated enough paper to distribute a hundred thousand vena two novels to their troops\nBecause he had said reading about vena too will help German officers you with your ... warfare on the Eastern Front that vintage who was the ideal company commander wasn't why\n[laughter] there were those people who said German children should only be confronted with area and heroes\nHowever Hitler was a fan and also fragments just said it would cost too much effort to try to suppress German Indian Suzie as them why not ... it's a profit from it\nPeople like you know how we take a novelist who wrote under the pseudonym ... said presenting Indian novels to German children teaches them about leadership and military ...\nGee how to teach about race ideology [noise]\nYeah they take wrote about ... and she likened to come so not only to the famous Germanic leader arming used who defeated the Roman legions at the battle of ... book forest in nine a D\nYou also like can take ... to Adolf Hitler saying all three United people who were ... among themselves and make the people's strong in the face of danger he also said take comes to last because\nThe different Native American tribes that he United did not feel themselves as a race as a people so he could not form a nation and that's what Hitler did when he United the core reeling German and I'm doing air quotes your rights", "show_name": "On the Media", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "07"}
