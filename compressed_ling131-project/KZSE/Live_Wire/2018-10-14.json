survive without me and that's great news and it's terrible news\nYou know it's the whole reason\nYou know so I always thought that the show was the thing that made me maybe the only thing that may be interesting right because they didn't have a great self image and then this other thing is when everyone thinks you're really lucky it takes you a really long time to realize how miserable you are\nI'm Talking to coordinate ... writer extraordinary\nRadio her [noise]\nYou described your personality is high in ... and blow in extra version which seems a like a bad fit for you or you know you've done stuff on stage of amazing singing voice you posted this show you're like how do you square those two parts of your personality\nUm it's very difficult I mean I I struggle with neurologist

but at the same time\nHearing their applause and their laughter was proof that I was an okay person you know and and I think that when I lost the hosting gig\nAnd I realized ... one of the things that I lost was just all of these people who mistakenly would sort of gives me credit for them having a great time for three hours on a Saturday Night you know and\nWorthy of something and you cannot get your self worth from four hundred drunk people that the terrible idea\nI'm going to do my damn just to see if I can make\nThat All right\nSo you you you started writing this column and you started

amazing when did you feel most out of your element in all these different things that you took on\nCoddling Pauli Amory drugs you name it I Would say\nI was most uncomfortable going to the professional Cutler my imagining that was by far the most difficult thing for me\nAnd can you explain the professional color I mean it's sort of right there in the title yes but for folks that are familiar with what what what has wanted to address\nTheir name is Samantha house and she has a business called cuddle up to me and you pay a dollar a minute to cuddle her um she had a business out of her house for a long time but she was so successful that she opened up a storefront here in Portland\nAnd she is fifty six different positions that you can choose from but she really sort of as an impasse and kind of decides what you need\nAnd what it's like why was that one of the things that was really scary for you\nFor me I'm afraid to talk to strangers I don't like talking to strangers I never approach people in public\nUm and so for me the idea of than cuddling with a stranger is far far worse but another reason that gave me a lot of trepidation was that I saw the the the ocean of snark that came at her when she got a lot of media attention and I thought that people said things like that is pathetic\nAnd you know are just terrible things about the people who needed her\nAnd the thing was I have been single the majority of my adult life\nStayed where people weren't touching me and people who get touched on a regular basis they don't understand what it feels like\nTo knock it touched and what it does to your self image you start to believe that you don't deserve to be touched or loved and that feeling is so vulnerable\nAnd and so what gave me trepidation about it was it I related to the people who needed her so there was so much bound up and going to see her and you know so many so much fear and she immediately\nPut me as much as ... as I could have been when my entire body was a two by four you know like I so I turned into maybe a piece of on cook spaghetti and so you know yeah but we titled for a while then she had me do these African nations\nAnd wish I hate affirmation I hate them so much but\nBut the one thing she made me say you know I'm enough I'm amazing which I Know I Know it's ... and I was fine with it I was like this is fine I Am enough right now
