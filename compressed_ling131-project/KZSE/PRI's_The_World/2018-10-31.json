S. you're automatically a citizen it's not clear if he can do that the concept is enshrined in an amendment to the U.S constitution by the president told access he could do away with it unilaterally\nYou can definitely do with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nMartha Jones is a professor at Johns Hopkins university the author of birthright citizens a history of race and rights so this is all tied into the ...\nIt could could you talk about what went into forming a\nSure the fourteenth amendment comes into being in the aftermath of the U.S civil war\nFor a million plus former slaves are now free people and the question is who will they be in a formal constitutional sense with respect to the nation the fourteenth amendment\nDeclares them to be birthright citizens but it goes further of course because it extends beyond former slaves to all persons born in the United states making them citizens of the United states\nSo let's talk about the uh more in a moment I'm a because it's all part of of your research let's just get into the president's for what we're looking at today or a prior caseloads came close to defining or interpreting this from the Supreme Court the most important\nCase for thinking about this question is that of a gentleman named belong Kim arc I'm neutral decided by the Supreme Court in Eighteen Ninety eight one Kim ark is born in the United states um his parents are Chinese immigrants who\nCannot become citizens of the United states because of the existing Chinese exclusion acts of the period but long himself assumes himself to be a citizen because he was born in the United states he leaves states to do business in China\nAnd when he returns he's detained at the port and refused re entry his case goes to the U.S Supreme Court where the court affirms that\nEven as long Kim arts parents cannot become citizens of the United states he because he was born in the U.S pursuant to the fourteenth amendment is a citizen\nSo it seems like we have kind of centered on the parents did did the outcome of the Supreme Court essentially defined birthright citizenship as we know today\nWell it did it in the important sense that um it rejected the view that one citizenship turned on\nParents um and so as a President Trump now I'm appears to be aiming for um those born in the U.S whose parents are not citizens long Kim are is an important touchstone\nWith Antonio Banderas his new book is called dear America notes of an undocumented citizen let's say thank you thank you so much for having me [noise]\nWe have rivers was full interview with Vargas by the way as a world dot O.

two U.S senators and you're\nUm I think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews as we know from hold support Donald Trump they don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much better domestic these it's important to Israeli Jews as the Trump support Israel to Trump's support the strong Israel so I'm ... comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nDue to tell me a bit about reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nSay over all although there has been expressions of condolence expressions of shocking to hire\nThe new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact\nAs it's had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews a synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school where they hide as I did like hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place\nWhere you would play kind of come of age and that you you know this is the place\nIs there a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm One of the stories that move me most was the story of\nJerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that was when he was shot\nAnd and as an immoral and Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream orders hottest which is a Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the cash and that is traditionally a time but only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day\nThere will be nobody's to stand for me so I stand for all of those who have no one to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing up and that standing up together is such a metaphor and I think\nOverall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a synagogue given Jewish humidity because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to find a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls of a synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nYou know the president does reveal across the differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\n[noise] me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and Israeli Jews are two very different paths right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached\nTo their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rights for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the Senate that's repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant would just be kind to the stranger because you two are much once a stranger in Egypt and so there's this very\nYou know American Jews have done fairly well to themselves in in America and feel fairly successful into so very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lead them to be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews steal steal under attack they feel very much sort of\nThe product of sort of post traumatic has Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much and it sort of zero sum game at times you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know\nI'm threats from within somehow an Israeli the trend toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a transit of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think you should those divisions coming more clearly now and Pittsburgh\nAttach tragically in some ways highlight those splintered\nReporter Dana cropped with Haaretz in Tel Aviv she's also the host of the podcast the branch Dina thanks very much for your time

clearly we're losing old corals that we would hope and that means the rates of changing the environments have essentially out pace the capacity of the calls themselves to adopt\nRoof gates died last week at the age of fifty six just months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was says gates was one of the very first scientists to make the connection between coral bleaching and global warming\nStarted in the Nineteen eighties in the very early days when none of us understood what was going on she was able to show that corals did this strange pale\nProgramming is supported by Mira a new kind of precision pain clinics pinpoints paying at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing NRA clinics dot\nCom that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adopt to warming oceans run Virginia was she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking jets to them she had\nThis wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon and she was able to tell the story of corals and she was brilliant at if she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an icon a closet or feel why\nSo she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution of corals very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster to be able to tolerate\nThe heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that but others led by roots really feel that we need to try a variety of options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know\nBut personally I feel very strongly shoes and iconoclast in terms of the way she approached science she disliked pushing your colleagues aside to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging\nAll diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world of coral science\n[noise] such determination to help these coral reefs are in the face of in the past few years several major coral reef bleaching events and the rest of the news isn't good I mean coral reefs are expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades\nAnd yet Rick Gates remain so optimistic how did she retained that optimism most studying something so depressing\nWell it's such a great question mark how I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her life\nShe just looked forward and she felt like you know we can try our hands up and give up or we can look for solutions then I think her enthusiasm really instilled that same passion and a lot of other people\n[noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about Rick Gates\n[noise] her laugh\nYou know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that failed around people in restaurants would turn around and stare I mean ... and she laughs she left early and often and it was infectious\nVirginia was a biology professor at Oregon State university and a longtime friend and colleague of coral researcher Ruth Gates who died last week Virginia thanks for telling us about Ruth and our condolences to you\nThank you so much Marco\n\n\n\n\nThis is the world or support for the world comes from YouTube originals and roadside attraction is presenting Pfeifer
