Africa gotten from the public like from Cameron in Nigeria itself\nThe feedback has been overwhelming and people of all walks of life from around the world responding to this and saying you know well done on the work\nBut I think one thing that people are most fascinated by is the message you know the location that use of mathematical calculations calculating for example\nYou know the angle of the

these children are suffering you know I may have experienced some kind of trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving and or possibly route and so and so it's very important that these children have\nYou know the attention that they need and the access that they need to and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like ... to merge and see just already we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um the the kids you know we were told the kids get work books but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc it's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it\nBut you know they've just been transition there from a different facility they don't know anyone there disoriented you know their possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um it's quite stable I think\nYou're ... when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help\nWell that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent\nShelters are provided with an you know your rights presentation on they receive screenings and so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues um\nYou know because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that tornado I'm at the ... facility and you know the access to legal services there has been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMeantime the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we have a system we have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection in this country we have that in place you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment in the system there is a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff\nFor those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow or oh the process doesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's chronic lack of investing in a system\nWe we need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just not a price not a long term it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nHopeful you know what I Am hopeful in the sense that I think I'm I'm I'm you know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know doing a lot of visits certainly to different shelters looking at this this issue holistically from from\nI'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously it's one thing to have that versus you know commitment to funding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children to appropriate and safe sponsor and as soon as possible\n... an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much President Trump's crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency\nThis change would essentially mean that anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government by accessing government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for Lucy says she's already seen that happening but loosely the pediatrician and Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule is a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice to either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services\nThat include healthcare and Nutrition Assistance or your family can remain together in this country so really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to childhood family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still in the proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing for families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used\nProgramming is supported by near or a new kind of

so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you can tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say the one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so as recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old and as with many new moms\nI'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so\nNow she's also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom I'm so they usually do I talked about the many benefits those federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed\nOr food assistance but she declined\nI'm and she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S so I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all of the support\nThat they could get if their families were not being placed in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nStability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice for the message that immigrant families are hearing is that they have to make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean it's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately have an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are affected include Medicaid so\nWhich which really is a lifeline for a lot of my family as they would not be able to afford the preventive care the specialty care that dental care that all kids need if they didn't have Medicaid and includes programs like snap or food stamps that\nProvides healthy foods and includes housing assistance I'm In other services that actually allow them to be healthy and stable so that they can contribute to the United states to our economy to our society\nDr lawn rifle lose a pediatrician in Washington with the Children's National health system also a spokesperson for the American Academy
