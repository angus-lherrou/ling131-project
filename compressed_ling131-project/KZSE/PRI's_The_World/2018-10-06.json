on the court\nIs the things that are all ... and he should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that is his performance during the hearings cause me to change when la\nNina Totenberg an extraordinary moment of former justice saying that about a nominee\nWell what he said was that because Kavanaugh had framed his entire critique at his the second round of hearings as a partisan attack not just on Democrats but I'm liberal groups and I'm like liberal activists\nThat all those people when they come to the Supreme Court could rightly maintained that they won't get a fair and

to same sex marriages would be very surprising to see the court\nKind of do a one eighty on that there are areas of the law where there's just playing the joints\nWhere you don't have to overrule something so to take abortion the standard is whether it's an undue burden on the woman's ... exercise of the right well who knows what that means you can feel into that whatever it is you want almost
