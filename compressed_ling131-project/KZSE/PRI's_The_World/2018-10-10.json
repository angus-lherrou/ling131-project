resignation why no\nWell the timing was somewhat of a surprise Marco but I Do think\nIt's no secret that ambassador Haley's influence has been in decline since John Bolton took on his role as national security advisor Nikki Haley is not someone who folds easily I Would say and so the idea that\nIf her role were significantly diminished by the arrival of secretary of ... and\nJohn Bolton that she would depart I think is is a logical next step\nYeah I mean tell me more about the arrival of John Bolton Trump's national security advisor because he's reputed to throw his weight around and he's got strong views of the UN to boot how well did he ... he would get along\nMy understanding is that he certainly exerted more as an influence\nIs a former U.S ambassador to the United nations and so this has somewhat of a pet issue for him and during his tenure he was famous or rather perhaps infamous for his dislike of the un and his skepticism of multilateral is more generally\nYou said her clout had been on the decline can you elaborate a little bit more on that\nDuring the early months of the Trump Administration Nikki Haley was really willing to push U.S policy in areas particularly concerned in Russia\nAnd Ukraine from her perch at the un and she was able to do that because there was a vacuum as Tillerson declined to engage with both allies and adversaries\nSecretary Pompeo

about the cover identities or this guy so we now know his real name is Aleksandr Michigan but before he was ... he was known as Oxnard Petra which was his coverage and says you know totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel under\nUm and so we had some information about that cover identity including his birthday um where he had to pass password issue too which is a very small town in the middle of nowhere I'm In northern Russia\nSo that was a good starting point so talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably\nUse some of the same information or discover identity from his real identity so we looked into a bunch of databases some of them are openly available some of them are late um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that they're leaked the databases\nFrom driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find a few years now where to look in sort of cross reference everything we could find and we found him ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan at the same birth date and this from roughly the same village in the middle of nowhere and northern Russia\nAnd after a bunch of digging including actually sending someone to go to this tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ on before he goes well medical school\nHe was he a DJ at the local club one club I'm sure they had in a tiny

process uh you and your investigators\nThe mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this was a lot of very creative thinking thinking of a mini vulnerability of what would leave a paper trail from a spy and Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all been forged his hidden away forever but again these spies have real lives to they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that we tracked back to them so I mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy work but a lot of very very basic routine research on this stuff you wanted and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for an interesting details a cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able
