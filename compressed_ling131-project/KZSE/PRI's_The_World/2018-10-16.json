their whole idea for the monument and as you've no doubt gassed they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than a nice easy fiction\nSo so everything is is changing and sort\nOf things on the move so we had lots of different ways of representing this moment\nAnd then gradually it crystallized into something as simple as a whole because it's something you can move around it also represents what we're wrong because everything that we're talking about or thinking about is on she affected by balls\nOkay so some kind of ball something that rules but also something that doesn't roll too much ... are really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presidents and certain physicality a certain weight\nSo an enormous mall of concrete ... tons it's three meters in diameter or about nine feet so it's it's bigger than us\nHas to be big enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms rocked it and even if five people link there also it'd be it'd be having a struggle so it's it's something you you can't contain it has its own life\nDoes its own thing and we just have to follow unlike now even though we know he's going all the summer it will go south\nYep you heard that right it's even more complicated\nThe Arctic Circle isn't only moving in one direction moon has referred to source team says that if the earth's axis ways back and forth about twenty thousand years in each direction there was a much smaller faster wobble happening as well this one is caused by the moon\nOn ... going to choose\nWhat it comes down to is this the movement of the Arctic Circle isn't a straight line it's a squid all a big line moving in one direction with a bunch of smaller little ... and then just when I thought I really understood what was going on or seen said this\nLooks out as one factor comes into the wrong people remember finger brokered a lot to use the movement of the U.S crushed this is something we can't predict very accurately\nPieces of the earth's crust are also moving in that throws another ranch in the works I have to say as I was learning all of this my heart kind of went out to Steve and Kristin and the competition organizers\nIt seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on his tidy little line the human beings have drawn around the top of the earth\nBut the deeper these two went into it the more complex it became\nBut I think that's also something you accept as you get older you realize that you don't have a grasp on everything the older you get the more you realize you don't know\nThis kind of thing happens to all of us this moment when we learn something new that makes everything\nIt's hot and then we have to decide if we're gonna take that in our turn away\nThis happens a lot with climate change as we learn about how our own actions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes\nNot our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and wondered could there be anything to that so let's take a quick look\nFirst of all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages and warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years\nThe warming we're experiencing now is happening at lightning speed in comparison we can measure it in decades and the cause of that warming is clear it's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not traps more heat this is a fact\nSo we have a choice do we try to push it aside so that we don't have to change or do we accept the truth as difficult as it might be\nWhen it came to making this Arctic Circle monument Steve and Kristin chose option number two they open themselves up to the more complicated truths\nAnd it turned out to lead to something pretty darn cool\nThis is a moving ... which which is nothing you can touch or see I'm not sure we trusting of the object is following this or do\n\nThe ball is the least important about the piece itself\nIs it represents the movement\nWe humans don't really like change we like sharp lines from definitions but the actual physical world doesn't work this way it's really hard to find a straight line in nature instead they're occurs twists and blurred boundaries and always always change\nEverything everything is nothing short of\nEven it turns out the Arctic Circle and an eight ... of concrete both of which are scheduled to leave the island in the year twenty

what is the Arctic and the answer anything above the ... line which fluctuates between sixty five and a half in sixty eight degrees numbers which is so messy and complicated there's really nothing
