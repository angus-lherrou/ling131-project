government spending bill that ever it's a partial government shutdown and careful analysis that provides contacts deeper understanding we're bringing you three views on\nOr are these campaigns are targeting specific races in specific states even in\nRaces that have been very high profile for example the cruise or work Senate race in Texas right well there is a lot of social media engagement around that race\nAnd there are some tactics being used again by we think domestic actors that are arguably manipulative we're not seeing a lot of foreign amplification of um of one candidate or another and in those races\nGenerally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw in the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done what\nWe're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms haven't proved to their ability to detect\nCertain types of tactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but of course new tactics are evolving a new proxies are being developed or new human assets are being cultivated so that foreign actors can operate through real Americans and ... skate their activity um and in terms of strategy\nInto the next as much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections are very divisive and\nAnd the more divisive they can make that conversation the veteran the cabin on nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course\nThat's been a a very sort of an open wound for the country right now so it's really no surprise that these accounts were trying to\nUm exacerbate that uh that discord\nSpeaking of social media tactics we just heard a story about Facebook working with fact checkers are on the ground and Brazil to prevent the spread of disinformation or as people there had to polls over the weekend this coming weekend our Facebook and other social media companies doing the same kind of things here in the U.S\nThey are and I think working with fact checkers is certainly one part of the solution of course we want the information that gets disseminated on line to be authentic and correct\nBut what we think about is this information is actually less about the truth or the authenticity in any given story and more about how it's distributed\nIs the platform being manipulated to elevate one story or one narrative at one point of view over another and I think that's where the social media platforms are also starting to work with third parties to identify this sort of manipulative distribution\n[noise] I I just want to ask you about the the news today a department of justice that charging seven Russian military officials for hacking into anti doping agency's and activists as well as a Pennsylvania nuclear energy concern um it's kind of apples and oranges compared to what we're talking about but it does suggest more Russian meddling\nHow do you see these charges against the concern of more apparent election meddling\nI think this is actually an indication that what we traditionally think about as cyber warfare and what we started to think about his information warfare are actually wanting the same and the more that we think about this\nThe more we'll be able to defend ourselves against these types of attacks in the future and thoughtfully engage with our adversaries around what isn't isn't acceptable or you know what are the rules of the road in terms of
