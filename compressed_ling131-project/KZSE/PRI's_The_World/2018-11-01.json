American society right now even for people who are very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency so that's the hard road that I think Americans attacking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been extremely\nMay pay Trump's support as as I say Trump has being somebody who's just shaking up the country you know why that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and they'll site North Korea is an example of that the tariffs wars with China and the other side of the coin it's division it's the shouting out it's the singling out of minority groups and individuals\nThat people find very offensive and drives a lot of their intentions in his mid ...\nThey weren't terrorists that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what that is a fascinating thing you know we're just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conduct a little focus group they're primarily amongst farmers\nAnd what they told us was that even though China's not buying their crops the down by about twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then which make two other families inside well that is well and good but ... and if we can solve this problem out really soon we got to have another hobby of snakes human not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to all cause can out why the hip pocket and the recall it in stride but usually ... people's biting intentions of going to be ... have you ever seen that dynamic like that back in Australia\nIt's very rare except in a strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and\nIt usually comes with people who once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left out left behind and I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago and we had a woman called polling Hansen she still around and she ran a particular one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and Asian tourists to strike it but people in tourists dependent electric was voting for her and sorry yeah sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once and it said was a ... vote for Thanksgiving sometimes that just happens to\nThe question though I think that we're going to have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well has Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoors through October an indoor markets open throughout the winter you can visit farmers' markets of M.

it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success of policy if we're talking Afghanistan and particularly well\nYou had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end the reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point and news story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the mix\nOh the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol\nAnd in the minds of some Americans have probably says ... how we have an invasion coming or we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins of the idea that we're going to be decisive flipper really defending what we ought to do is put drones out to get targeting and do airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it\nBefore it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even\nSend the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis it's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras Guatemala\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue\nSo I think it's when we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue 'cause the route issue here is one of our immigration policy and in America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy it reflects those\nAnd it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid off from me what is your take on the on the tone things up by the oval office\nDon't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expanded beyond the oval office I Would say on the left in the right there's a ... to the rhetoric now and this gets back to what we talked about earlier and values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror\nOur our values what do we want from our leaders because I don't expect the president to have the answers I expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president\nTo reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be when I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says well I Need to be a little more patient I Need to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate I expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be\nAn does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nWell I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question\nI'm I'm at all when you dizzy reflect your values general\nI think I just answered that question I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to but I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very
