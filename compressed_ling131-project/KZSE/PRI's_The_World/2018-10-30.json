the ... is that old like it is made out of material from finds that used to grow at that time\nAnd the remains of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material has a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so when ... says the soil has a lot of dead plants in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nYeah we have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the plug out of the freezer and the stars and she saw\nAnd so then one from a forest it starts to truly saw than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because migrants are eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing\nBasically and then they emit carbon so it's micro breath that we have to worry about [laughter] basically [laughter]\nMicrobes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn upper basin gets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere as methane or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes down but it doesn't kill them stalling speeds them back up\n\nTo a big funnel floating upside down in the water that has a big syringe feed it onto the skinny and sticking out these little contraptions look pretty

we used to love and the measure the actual construction\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas and these scientists have forty or these bubbles trapped on this lake and a bunch more nearby they check all of them multiple times a week all summer long\nAnd this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year under these particular conditions groups of scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation\nAnd they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nThink the the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon bookstores here in the room for us we're trying to actively to figure that out\nHard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex\nBut it's also hard because humans have never warm the planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective we're in what climate scientists call a new analog situation a massive global experiment\nThere's not that we turn on the Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop for not [noise]\nIf you have a warming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to thought and that is something that scientists are really worried about because there are many ah thresholds that you might cross there\n... very says that in many parts of the Arctic the permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that pay the point where a change of one or two degrees can transform it from being something that stores carbon to something that ... that\nWe might tip the scales of these really large exchanges then it can have really dramatic consequences\nIt's not about saving the polar bear I think a lot of people and I think I'm a chick flick disappear the pull up there it's cute but but it's also about like us surviving as a species because if it gets much warmer\nLike the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we\nLike the food that we eat\nAnd where we live is just not adapted to that\nDon't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point scientists call it\nBeen in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon in the process just built on itself\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilizations\nI ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this experiment for conducting on the Arctic or if he thought the damage was already done and now we just have to ride it out
