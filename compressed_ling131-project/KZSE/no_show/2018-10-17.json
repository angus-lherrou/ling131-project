right it's utilizing wearable technology to make someone aware of their own behaviors and that's a very appropriate use\nOf technology for for mental health and and there are many out there there are

think\nTo to speak about what we're doing in context of what's already in place because there are so many professionals doing great work across the board and they all want to do more so how do we get the data and get the outcomes necessary so that they feel comfortable prescribing and recommending\nSo I really feel that it's in the case of Tyler I saw what he was doing\nA and I said I see

stability makers a group of donors who believe in the power of equitable and dignified homes for everyone urban home works dot org backslash donate\nWell I think that's\nTo be determined I I Believe that\nDigital mental health tools will become the most prolific category of mental health treatment\nBecause of the ubiquity of data once again a practitioner who is in an intensive therapy can only get covered for ten to twelve sessions so at best that's ten to twelve hours with a person over the span of a couple of months and so if they're able to benefit from that data\nWho knows where this can go and so for our in our case we want a folk very specific we want to focus very specifically on the disease the mental health is the state of nightmare disorder\nAnd treat that well and work within the context of how psychiatrists are prescribing and how people are looking at this from a clinical perspective\nOnce we gain that beach had\nThere are multiple opportunities for us to treat additional disease states in fact within our focus group\nOr a a veteran prescribe a severe PATS D is utilizing night where for daytime anxiety disorder so utilizing the sensors on the watch setting their threshold to make them aware of daytime anxiety disorder and so\nTo your point about consumer applications there are hundreds of sleep apps out there\nAnd they're very limited in what claims they can make and their their limits\nIn where they can go from a a professional medical\nA perspective in terms of coverage and so for us we wanna we wanna once again\nUh bring that\nBurden of data to the practitioner so they can prescribe with with one caviar and I want to commend both the or companies because there are I attended a digital therapeutics conference last week where there are people raising tens of millions of dollars\nA running multiple randomized clinical trials and targeting huge reimbursement\nA target prices\nThat's necessity that by the amount of money they're raising Seventy million dollars twenty thirty million from health insurance companies Medicare Medicaid right in where both of your companies are at a price point at at an entry point where you can play to both those payer systems as well as direct to consumer\nAnd especially in the case a habit of where you've just been able to do\nHardware so difficult and being able to get to market with a hardware device that is helping so many people is\nA very Minnesota story in my opinion somebody pragmatically wanted to solve a problem and they figured out how to get to market on minimal capital\nCity at what are you watching I mean what do you feel is you know the the frontier and this sort of digital space mobile app\nSoftware you know what what are you paying attention to what do you think\nWhere do you see this going\nI I mean certainly in the first thing I Would suggest is that there's an interesting convergence and it's it's convenient that we're all together or for this particular fan of because I think for um you know the three of us represent three very specific ways are that are quickly becoming Proven Ways to address that\nProblem with mental health and so uh I I Would suggest that we're going to continue to see more and more um\nYou know wearables wearable tracking devices you know out based programs like ours that do a lot of chickens during the day that are also Web based um that tackled very specific issues that also then learned to connect to a a bigger ecosystem and that's one thing to an eel is point I think is exciting even about here in Minnesota\nIs that here the three of us said with complimentary\nOfferings I and also I think the greatest point earlier um I think one of the things that will prove itself out over time is those with the real outcomes those with those that have Greek capital efficiency\nAre those that have you know when when we're on the west coast you know we're fortunate to here I think at first I didn't know how to take it and now I see it as a compliment when they say you know you have great bone structure\nYou know with your company you've done a lot with a little you know and uh I've learned to really take that as a complement to the bathroom the head it feels like they're you know they're sitting higher and I see the\nUm but I but I think there's the reality of that is you know we've been very focused on outcomes and we've grown over time to really make sure that as we scale that we we keep our outcomes in a very specific place and consumers know that you know they're they're very sophisticated and\nThe organizations we partner with no that as well and so I think the the proven apps what are you know apps are wearables will be the ones that that stand up and then link to other points of care in the ... system so\nLooking over the next five years five year plan what is the the gross strategy a new for us our goal is to start looking at how we can adapt teens technology to help with other mental health condition so we're starting on that task\nI'm into your point earlier about you know digital innovation\nSome of the issues that we have today are because of these devices that we can\nThey will use technology to solve it as well so it it's going to be exciting to see where we go in the next five years where learn to live ... we're not aware knows where all these different innovations come from and\nHow we adapt and change to help people and their problem adapt and change because we're you know to your point earlier why or why are these he's investing in this now well it's because of things like costs in mind where\nPeople are talking about these things now and the problem is now at the surface and now it's time to invest in these solutions so that\nWe can solve those and I'm sure you've problems ... attack\nHuman beings gritty um\nYou you were talking about reimbursement you're dealing with the VA you know once you get into the world and Medicaid\nMedicare a lot of rules a lot of regulations how hard is it to\nMake your way in that world\nA\nMedicaid in VA have a long history of working together in a complementary fashion and those are really those are the those are the two areas where we actually see the clearest path is with the VA\nAnd and medicate and then in in the terms of private payers it's really about doing a health economics analysis the fact is that only twenty percent of\n... the diagnoses annually are veterans\nSo the rest of those people are victims of sexual assault violence ... called morbid with other issues\nAnd so private payers are already paying for these people not necessarily in the code ah associated with a ... a pie TST but all the other costs of care and so we believe that we can provide a cost savings to private payers but\nThey're not going to take our word for it we've got a ...\nCompany has done a frankly to much greater expense in the case of devices and pharma\nUm estimates too I mean what does it cost to get to\nTo get a new drug to to market some people estimate it's up to a billion dollars right we're nowhere near that so when it comes to things like regulatory and reimbursement requirements\nWe've got to work with the his historical precedent and once again it's on us to provide the compelling data and the compelling patient stories\nIn order to get payers too that\nIndia what about employers\nNow are you seeing employers more receptive to your product is that it in an area where you're expanding into\nEmployers make up a a meaningful portion of our client base for sure um\nYou know there are generally find you know especially think of Minnesota and the\nYou know the general mills and some of the other companies here that are set and assume even heard of this conference that are so progressive and they're so open to things that certainly many employers you know find the funding you know we we seek to provide a pretty modest price point\nA to make it attractive and also we can scale from the digital point of view so uh certainly employers are getting on board and you know we don't we're exploring Medicaid Medicare or as well\nOn Thursday night

could be good enough Senator Ted Cruz has some Latino support as he runs for re election in Texas and then there's Rick Scott a Florida the Republican governor is running for Senate in a state where the Latino vote is big NPR's Asma Khalid reports\nAlong a busy street heartland do a group of Rick Scott supporters chanted known more now than in Spanish as they waived Puerto Rican flags but just steps away the governor of Puerto Rico was backing Scott's opponent Bill Nelson\nI Am proud to say that I Am endorsing the lessons for uh once I get in the U.S editor of Florida and helping people avoid those\nBut even in endorsing Nelson the governor of Puerto Rico described Rick Scott as a friend Scott has gone to Puerto Rico eight times in the last year he also created a welcome center at the Orlando Airport where Puerto Ricans arriving after Hurricane Maria could immediately get driver's licenses\nAnd through that all he's won over some skeptics\nLet me be very honest with you at any ... in the beginning and who govern for the election\nCarrying the as far as it considers herself one hundred percent Democrat we first met in twenty Fifteen she despise Donald Trump back then and she

the support of a majority of Latino voters but a couple of surveys in August and September showed scot doing well with Puerto Rican men and older Latinos\nAnd the fact that Scott was doing better than thirty five percent suggested that she was in a position to trying to deny Bill Nelson reelection which I think is a concern of many Democrats because potentially could opened any plans to recapture the chamber\nBut a Monday says even though Scott is trying to make inroads in the Latino community now since still has one big advantage\nHe happens to be on the ballot in the year where at least the
