C. Saudi\nJournalist is thrown a shadow over Saudi money American businesses have enjoyed Saturday investments for years only now are executives facing real questions about Saudi Arabia is absolute monarchy it's brutal war in Yemen and above all about the reported murder of journalist ...\nMuch Saudi money has gone to Silicon Valley and do some tech CEOs have backed out of a forthcoming Saudi investment conference the investments themselves remain writer ... says just been talking with audiences this week in Silicon valley and he's been telling them the Saudi money is tainted\nIn recent years the Saudi sovereign wealth fund has become one of the biggest swinging checkbooks in Silicon valley through a kind of open secret of a front which is soft bank a big Japanese fund that launched a hundred billion dollar vision fund\nForty five billion dollars of that first hundred billion dollar fund was the Saudi Government money and recently they announced the second vision fun\nSo Saudi Arabia if you have a start up and big dreams of changing the world making it a better place empowering women and others a lot of those people with a lot of those idealistic pretensions have been very happy to open up to Saturday investors\nLet me just ask how big this really is you just use huge numbers like a hundred billion dollars but you are referring to spreading that money among multiple companies in Silicon valley where sometimes now a company can be worth a trillion dollars are they just buying you know I don't know five percent of the stock of some company\nIt's varying but I'll tell you an ... for example softbank is now the largest single shareholder in ... with Saudi having half of that steak and I want to make a really important point about what this gets the Saudis\nIf you're the young crown prince you have a problem which is that the reality of your country is that it's a fairly barbaric medieval kingdom that runs itself\nAnd human rights declaration that is based on the degradation of women that heads people and that might well have murdered ... and the consulate in Istanbul that's a big image problem\nIn these investments in Silicon valley and then getting to go to Silicon Valley earlier this year and meet Mark Zuckerberg and meet Jeff Bass us and others he got exactly what he paid for he got the illusory glow of being part of the future and he got some ... column is to call him a reformer\nSo on and you have given one way that the Saudis seem to benefit from this connection with Silicon Valley the crown prince could go there and get a photo op [noise] but do you have any evidence that when the Saudis invest in a company there are some kinds of strings attached\nNo and that's not my claim my concern is that Silicon Valley is not who would says it is when you spend time out there is I just did you hear an endless parade of platitudes about changing the world empowering people creating community giving voice\nAnd it's almost a parody of the fall city of those protections to raise money from one of the worst regimes on earth\nThat is absolutely in violation of every value here thrown around in Silicon valley and I want to be clear this financial investment is not the only thing that's happened you know as many of your listeners will remember there was this Davos in the desert conference then you've got this new five hundred billion dollar megacities the Saudis are creating called Neal\nAnd Neal again had all these Silicon Valley people in other corporate people\nOn the board and so these folks in Silicon valley make a lot of very important decisions about what kind of world we live in\nIf these people are basically no better than chemical magnates who'd dumped pollutants into rivers except the digital version of

you're thinking about the New York jets is that they drafted Sam darnel or who is probably the ah one of the two\nWe'll bowl and the draft a earlier this year he's they're starting quarterback and

close to winning last week it blew a ten point lead in the last few minutes to northwestern\nAnd uh one of the things that's rolling in the back of their players minds as they feel that Minnesota ran up the score toward the end of last year's game when the gophers one I Believe it was like fifty four to Twenty one which was one of the few good games that the Minnesota played it in the in the Big Ten\nOr the other thing that's interesting about the Nebraska situation camp for years they brought in a new coach Scott Frost who was not only their quarterback the last time they want a national title in uh Nineteen Ninety seven\nBut he came from the University of central Florida where that team had to put put together a perfect Thirteen and record last season so I think people were expecting

News I'm Mike ... election day is less than three weeks away and today\nWe're talking to more of the candidates about the issues at stake when you go to vote later I'll talk to the candidates for Congress in the seventh district but first it's the sixth district race\nThe district north and west of the central Twin Cities includes the St Cloud area south through right county and beyond what cornea and east over the forest lake in Hugo\nFor the past four years it's been represented by Tom Emmer and Washington and he's a former state representative he was the Republican candidate for governor and twenty ten and spent some time as a talk radio host his DFL challenger this year is Ian Todd he's a former intelligence analyst in the U.S air force who lives in sock Rapids\nGentleman thanks to both of you for being here today I really appreciate your coming in\nThings rattling us let's skip the opening statements and get right to some questions in Todd you're the challenger let me start with you why should voters choose you for this job\nRound the district and I've been talking to voters at the door is I pretty much constantly since ah since I got out of the air force so last October\nAnd I have been learning that really when it comes down to it we all want the same things we have a common view of what we want for America\nAnd some of the biggest issues that we're dealing with or things like health care in the absolutely astronomical costs to the people are paying right now uh people are talking about what's going on in Washington when it comes to corruption and the money in politics\nI and people are absolutely concerned about what's going on in the environment not just here in Minnesota but also the environment I in a grand scale employment change and and what would you do about that why would you be the best person\nWell I I mean for a number of reasons uh when it comes to health care we actually have a plan I'm I Want Medicare for all I\nAnd as it is right now there's not really a plan on the Republican side it's mostly just reasons why Medicare for all isn't good enough but the reality is what we have right now is not good enough\nAnd we need a plan and right now Medicare for all is our best plan forward and it's the only plan out there that truly make sure that nobody falls through the cracks okay sure that nobody's left uninsured\nOkay we'll get to more on health care I met at Tom Emmer why should you get another term well I\nThink if you look at its results I that's why\nA resist which is a ... seems to be the ah opposition's campaign slogan a it's not a campaign slogan it's about results versus resist it if you go back to December of two thousand six team the GDP in this country was one point seven percent\nOr you can't do anything if your economy is not growing you can't say you can't see people's lives the quality of our lives improve without economic prosperity what's happened might ah in just the last short of two years we now as of ah the last quarter for point too\nBut see that again third quarter of this year I Believe the Atlanta fed just said four percent and they're projecting for the the first quarter of next year or five percent or better I I think the question that people have to ask themselves and they are asking themselves before they vote this year as\nYou win Minnesotans were given the opportunity to make sure that we had a system of health insurance\nBecause people put these together it's health care and health insurance and when we were able to provide a system of health insurance and the state we did it as well or better than any other state in the union and I\nI just suggested my colleague I've run a business I Know what an additive the caution you started out by saying a to point to personal income tax and they threw in six percent tax over here at the end of the day you will never have enough to fund is you've got to restore\nThe ability of individuals to make choices and of the state to make sure that that basic essential benefit packages available to them\nI provided for one of my kids when he was twenty two years old it was a one hundred dollar a month policy today that same policy because we've let\nThe federal government and the bureaucrats get involved in this thing and we've taken it away from Minnesotans who know how to take care of themselves as that same policy is going to be three hundred four hundred dollars for that a college age kids will do homework\nCongressman let me ask you though because Republicans have the house the Senate and the White House and and you couldn't get the bill passed\nWell that's a little that's a little misleading because yes you have ... the ikea early obligations don't control gate is ... and not to quibble with you if you think about it we got a good majority in the house and we have passed the solutions out of the house\nSenate completely different uh animal the Senate with only one or two ... seat majority and with John McCain's illness and all the things you're having and you've got to have sixty votes so for people to suggest while you got this you got that you know it's just like the suicide prevention stuff that I'd been pushing the farmers or ranchers I ... a rancher hate us\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

R. go dot com\nThat it's fair that people would go back into those details if you don't understand how the mechanics work Chuck Schumer is one of the most powerful people in Washington until you get a few more Republican votes on the Senate side it's going to be that way\nIn Todd how are you going to get Medicare for all past assuming Donald Trump is still the president if if the Democrats take over the house the Senate will still be divided or a Republican controlled how do you get Medicare for all past\nWell it's not about necessarily getting just Medicare for all I and pushing that as an end all be all I'm willing to compromise on this I Would love to see Medicare as a public option I there are steps that we can take now if we can get Medicare for all play stand as soon as possible I Would love that\nI think that that is the best way for us to move forward but incremental steps are still important just like uh the stress act that Tom Emmer was talking about just a moment ago\nUh I've I've told you before I think the stress that is a fantastic idea and yes it was greeted by Democrats and it should have been funded but the reality is\nIn what way is that not socialized health care you were talking about giving mental health care to people who need it for free essentially it's taxpayer\nDollars that will be paying for this but the reality is our farmers need more than just that\nThey are under a lot of stress a lot of economic stress and they were paying perhaps more than anyone else I on health care right now it would be absolutely fantastic if we could take away those types of economic stressors from them my colleague Mike\nMy collie we he's had time to read my farmer rancher stressed assistant network a bill that since our last a debate\nWhen he also said it was a good idea I it's not socialized medicine what it is is it's a program that would allow local communities access to grant dollars to create their own programs for suicide awareness I don't know if you're aware of this but since Nineteen Ninety nine suicide in this country\nHas grown by twenty five percent this is a crisis and then our farm our communities where the prices are depressed and they've got some major challenges I it's even bigger I mean you look there are some reports out there that say compared to the general population\nOur farming community say experience suicide four or five times or what the what the normal population does so\nBefore you start going down that road was socialized medicine I Would suggest to my colleague that he should probably read the bill the other thing that people need to understand when they when we get into these I Believe your campaign on details\nWhen somebody says I Would like to compromise it is a catch phrase that has been used in politics for many years\nAnd most people on the street are very frustrated with it because I always tell the story you know when my wife and I got married Jackie wanted for kids I wanted three we compromise Mike we have seven All right it works great in marriage the problem with it in government and with people who campaign like this\nIs if everybody gets everything they want and everybody that's being asked to pay for it gets a whole bunch of things they don't necessarily need and we can't afford\nI don't even know what he means when he says public option I think the better thing is once again restored Minnesotans ability and I understand the ... that you were living somewhere else at the time but had you been here inexperienced what Minnesota was able to do before the Affordable CARE Act\nI think you'd be you'd be with me on this issue\nAnd tired of let you respond if you want you know I I wasn't here at the time I was in the military and I was serving in a job that also has an incredibly high suicide rate and I've lost friends I've lost\nBilly important issue but the reality is we can cover health care as well as full body care with a Medicare for all bill ... and I think that that is incredibly important when we talked about the stresses that people are experiencing when we talked about why suicide is up\nWhat has to do with the fact that we're doing so poorly right now I every one that I Know who has a college education that's my age also has a debt I\n... the people I Know who are my age the people who are coming up I'm twenty eight years old we are experiencing incredible economic stress right now because even though the economy might be building when you look at the stock market\nIt's not booming for us there is\nLow unemployment rates but there's also incredible amount of people who only have part time work this is a huge issue that we're experiencing and we don't have enough money to pay for this health insurance and you're going to buy a\nMonth after month just keeping our fingers crossed that nothing will crop up that's exactly what I'm doing I don't have health insurance and I know that it is easy for somebody like Tom Emmer who does have an pass the health insurance\nTo say that our system right now is it good or that the system that we used to have was fine but there were certainly problems and it and everybody knows that we didn't create the a CIA because the current system was functional\nNow was a CIA perfect absolutely not there are problems and if I thought the AC a with perfect than I Would not be advocating for Medicare for all but here I Am advocating for something else because what we've done hasn't worked so far we have got to do something because of this is a crisis and all of these issues are connected\nTom Emmer let me ask you about that 'cause you you said he wanted to talk about big issues in the big picture uh what about this issue that entire just brought up about some people especially younger people\nQuality things like that ... what is the role if any of Congress\nOr did he say income inequality what he said he\nWas saying that my people don't have the money to get out\nYou get frustrated 'cause you took his words you turned it into something else what he said was their own opportunities out there for everyone what he said was there are people that are under employed they're employed part time\nI don't know what Mr Todd is doing or where he's looking but that's simply is not a fact today in this economy you have seven million jobs available people are starting at Fifteen dollars an hour they're earning Eighteen within three months at jobs all over the place\nManufacturing is seen a resurgent was when we were told her to the last administration that's never going to happen there are jobs everywhere and if someone wants to make choices that affect their life\nThat's up to them now when it comes to health insurance I can tell you\nHe clearly doesn't understand what we have to deal with I got a large family that I raise fantastic health insurance I got to say I got through Congress\nAnd they were caught me Twenty one hundred dollars a month with a six thousand dollar deductible\nYou know what we didn't take it we stayed with something called met a share which is a program that was able we make choices and we keep our our uh our costs down I Know I Know my wife when he said\nFantastic healthcare is in the other room role in her eyes you know the thing if he doesn't understand is this great government program which he now wants to recreate is something called Medicare for all the one that's already failed that both Democrats and Republicans agree you know it wasn't a thousand dollars a month and\nIt was two to three to four thousand dollars a month people with families were being asked\nTo take twenty to twenty five thousand dollars of their income annually to pay for insurance premiums that they may or may not need to access for the coverage and then we had a five to ten thousand dollar deductible that was created by the Affordable CARE Act that did not exist before the Affordable CARE Act in by your silence on it\nAnd so the ideas will just call the same it's the same animal by\nA different name will call it Medicare for all and by the way it's so dangerous what you're doing\nBecause if you were ever to enact that you wouldn't Bernie Sanders what you would end up doing is you would bring the whole system down ... even the people right now\nThat rely on Medicare for their health care they would lose the option I'll tell you why because young people that you want to bring into this program or the healthiest and we you would use the least amount of healthcare services it's our seniors that are in their last years of life that need it and require the most\nOn the German was on vacation in Hawaii for two weeks during August when we should have been doing this bill\nThat is a much bigger problem than what happened with us and the reason I didn't speak to the chairman was because he told me this was not negotiable this was not we're not going to do anything we're not going to change it this is it take it or leave it\nAnd that's not how you get things done so\nYou know I I don't know what else I could have done a I tried to work with a German I tried to bring in some compromise that we could support he said nope I Can't I Can't compromise I don't know Paul Ryan told them to do that or what it was but that was the problem how do you talk to somebody when he says you know it's your my way or the highway and that's what he did\n... you get a ... yeah you get it done calling by going to him not withstanding what he said he said no I did I watch them two or three times but not even talking about seven or eight we actually did okay you know I Am the ... the south went through them and he wouldn't talk to us\nDave he's let me ask you about President Trump's tariffs are they worth the pain that they're causing to get what he hopes will be better trade deals\nI think they are and that's what I've been told by every farmer in western Minnesota with very few exceptions none of them ...\nSupport comes from urban home works stable homes offer long term positive effects on families consider joining the stability makers a group of donors who believe in the power of equitable and dignified homes for everyone urban home works dot org backslash donate\nExceptions they they say it's painful but it's worth it they trust him and it all has to be resolved by early spring that's the timeline and so we've seen a lot of improvement recently with these trade agreements and I'm confident we can get the job done by spring\nCollin Peterson what do you think on the president's trade stance well I think\nThat um the a renegotiation of NAFTA we were concerned about but we came out of that are not losing anything we didn't really gain\nBut on the case of China um I don't see any upside for agriculture in what's being done\nIn China um I understand what the president what he's trying to do here he's trying to get these jobs back to that we shipped to China Twenty years ago\nA what we should have done at that time was not lead trying to end of the WTO in the first place which I voted against a because we knew at the time they were going to require a U.S companies that went to China ever going to have to give fifty one percent of the company to the Chinese and they got forty nine percent\nAnd that's been the situation shall we shipped five six million jobs to China\nAnd those people are the jobs went into the people in the country that we're doing agriculture went into the city and agriculture picked up those markets a bus this fight is not over those egg markets are so I I just I don't see it I Hope I'm wrong but\nI I don't see an upside on this I see only a downside and I hope this gets over sooner rather than later\nThat's ... Peterson he's the DSL congressman from Minnesota the seventh district in western Minnesota he's seeking another turn this year his Republican opponent\nRan two years ago against the congressman a congressman Peterson all the Democrats in the house voted against the tax bill that passed last year was that a bad deal for people in the seventh district\nWell I don't know I don't know that it was necessarily a bad deal uh my biggest problem was it was not paid for and we were told well don't worry this has got to pay for itself\nWhile we just found out two days ago that the deficit has gone up Seventeen percent and the everybody that's commented on this said that the main reason is because of the tax cuts\nThe part of the tax cuts that I liked and I would have supported\nIs the corporate reduction or our corporate rate was out of whack with the rest of the world and I would have easily supportive going to Fifteen Percent on the corporate\nAnd not all the rest of the stuff that was added into this bill\nA so these past shrewd changes I think are going to come back to haunt us we just found out today that the elevators now are not going to be able to do that because they screwed it up\nUh in the individual area\nAnybody has a big family when they go to fill out their taxes this year are going to come out with a big surprise when they find out that this thing that was touted as a big win for them because of consolidating the Saturday doctrine and the exemptions if a big family you're going to lose\nIf you're in a state like Minnesota where they've limited the state and local tax deductions you're going to lose so there's not all positive and this but the biggest problem is a you know I think the corporations have responded than it's been good\nBut you know we did not um they said this was going to pay for itself\nI was skeptical and uh from what I can tell it did not pay for itself\nDave used would you have voted for the bill if you had been in Congress\nAbsolutely and where to start with what common just said uh when when he voted against it last fall he was asked by number of journalists\nWas because he didn't hear enough from of his from his constituents to vote for it you didn't have anything more thoughtful to say that and the fact of the matter is we have seen since then that every economic indicator that uh people in Congress look out for the health of the economy nationwide whether you're talking about I'm\nA ... a workforce participation rate unemployment rate uh homeownership rate entrepreneurship\nGDP Growth every single economic indicator wage growth all of them are up and they're up dramatically since then and so a to point out a couple of things that might theoretically come to pass a that might be slightly negative\nOr it just shows bad analysis and back conclusions on the part of ... and I absolutely would have voted for it and I'm ready for round two in January two thousand Nineteen because this first round of tax cuts so was better for the corporate side than it was for the for the individual side although it benefits the youth of the nation at large uh and now we're ready to do our part to and so all support that going forward\nAre you worried about the deficit at all because it is up Seventeen percent over last year and it's on track to hit a trillion dollars\nI'm absolutely worried about the deficit the office of management and budget which works for the White House is projecting a trillion dollar deficit\nAnd I'm like my friends on the left who are very inconsistent on this subject they still\nA frown and talk about the deficit so the eighties under Reagan and they're now they're they're walking about it but ah where where it was their concern during the Obama first term where we had four straight years one trillion plus dollar a year deficit or I Am consistently against deficit spending I Believe the national day of the United states is one of the greatest challenges facing our country\nAnd so one of the reasons I'm running as I Am a conservative and we've got to reign in spending spending is the key to it Collins said at the tax cut wasn't paid for that's a false narrative you pay for it by reducing spending and there's nobody in Congress with the exceptions who has an appetite for reducing spending and that's what I wanted to\nCollin Peterson what would you do about the federal deficit\nBalanced budget amendment for many sessions in Congress\nI have voted against some of these big huge um omnibus bills I voted against the tarp I voted against the stimulus I voted against all of those things that I drove up the deficits in the Obama years\nBut the second term of Obama's presidency and the deficit actually came down significantly\nAnd now the first two years of the Trump presidency they've gone back up\nSo you know this idea that uh that they're going to cut spending to pay for these tax cuts that's what we've heard you know over and over again a but nobody ever as they've said nobody ever wants to cut spending and one of the concerns of was raised by some people in our party which I didn't really\nYou know I was just a surprise to was that the uh public guns intended to costs Social Security and Medicare to pay for the tax cuts\nAnd what happens two days ago Mitch McConnell says that very thing\nThat they're going to have to go in and cut Social Security and Medicare in order to pay to get the deficit down and I can tell you this I Am absolutely one hundred percent against any cuts in Medicare and it costs and Social Security that's the last thing we should be doing in this economy they've he was what\nAbout you on Medicare and Social Security\nAt one quick thing on the taxpayer wouldn't call it an I devoted debated two years ago he laid out and are televised debates and specific things\nAre under which provisions under which he could vote foreign support tax cuts\nThat was two years ago that tax bill asphalt laid out most of that on the corporate side and he voted against it so I think that's a case where he went with his caucus instead of doing what he told the voters he would do two years ago\nWith regard to medicate into Social Security I don't believe that the Republicans are talking about making any cuts whatsoever to the benefit to the benefits of the beneficiaries what they're talking about is doing things that are a behind the scenes that are a duplicate duplicate of spending for instance\nTalking about doing away with a dual pay out of a a disability and unemployment doesn't make sense that you would pay both and so that's a part of of what the Republicans have talked about\nBut they're absolutely not talking about reducing in real terms or the benefits of the beneficiaries are nor would I support that uh we're looming and we're looking at a looming crisis coming up in the future twenty twenty six for Medicare to go in solving the twenty twenty twenty thirty four for Social Security\nAnd the problem is members of Congress including colon have never done anything about it and twenty eight years calling has not let on the subject and he has not achieved any success at\nSitting down and getting the hard work started of reforming those two programs and we need to do that sooner rather than later because those dates are are coming up quickly\nWell how do you reform the programs without

than we would have passed it by the end of September instead we're in a situation now with a lot of uncertainty\nPeterson says the gridlock was overworked requirements for food stamp recipients and
