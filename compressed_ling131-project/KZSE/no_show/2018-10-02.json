I Believe you counted a hundred examples of violence in Congress between Eighteen thirty and Eighteen sixty can you tell us about one or two you found particularly vivid\nOh sure ... and it ended up being about Seventy I was trying to be very strenuous about what I counted as a fight and I suppose I should say by fighting in Congress I actually mean physical fighting so as you suggested people pulling guns and knives people shutting each other people punching each other mass brawls\nA dual challenges gaining you name it it's happening in some way or another\nThere was a major fist fight involving a number of people right and then they only go wild when somebody snatched up someone's way\nExactly exactly and that's a that's a fascinating incident that's late one happens in Eighteen fifty eight but what's fascinating about it is a lot of the violence that I talk about in the book is usually one man versus another man very often a southerner provoking a northerner or or try to intimidate a northerner\nBut in eight fifty eight is we're creeping up towards the civil war\nI'm really talking about a house divided by by that point you really have southerners and northerners are to say there at odds that drastic understatement and so during an evening session and Eighteen\nThe kind of an aggressive northern Republican from Pennsylvania names wonderful nineteenth century named pollution grow a and he objects to something all standing amidst a bunch of southern Democrats and a south Carolinians named Lawrence kitsch\nObjects to the fact that grows dares say something objecting to something a southerner says oh he's storms over to him\nMore and more and more congressmen are armed in those last few years before the civil war not because they want to shoot each other but because they're afraid of what the other side might do the other side might say something horrible there might be warfare on the floor of the house or the Senate and if there is\nThey want to be armed and able to fight with their clothes so certainly the fighting breeds a kind of distrust in national governance national institutions and and other Americans in each other\nAnd boys are jobs for murder [laughter] indeed does that do you think give us some perspective on where we might be the day when people talk about as being on the brink of a civil war I don't think that's the case but do you see similarities between the Eighteen fifties in the present\nDo I also do not think we're on the brink of civil war but I think there are moments and all of those moments of Seventy nineties Eighteen fifties the Nineteen sixties those moments when Americans understand\nThere's some kind of a shift happening in the climate the political cultural and social climate and it just raises the stakes of politics\nAnd makes it very hard I think people feel that if they don't give their all and do whatever it takes to get what they want that they're going to fundamentally lose the battle for all time if you look at the Seventeen nineties their politicians\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

debt crisis and that they were corrupt themselves so they were open to an outsider candidacy of Hugo Chavez who came along in Nineteen Ninety eight and said look the problems are\nThese political elites who have been running things into the ground and spending your money and we need to change things up and renew our democracy and redistribute the oil wealth to the poor so many in the country bought that he was elected but he came in with the very transformative agenda\nAnd he used a confrontational and very polarizing strategy to try to accomplish the change that he wanted to accomplish\nAnd as he did that he created a backlash they would have dueling massive protests in the street and in one of those shots were fired a number of people were killed in the military blame Chavez and removed him in a coup\nA which only lasted two days and he was brought back when his people came out into the street in the military change their mind and brought him back\nSo the confrontation came I think from the need for change from people suffering from that economic crisis and feeling like their political leaders were not paying attention to them well you've written that when one party starts\nTo dig in and refuses to compromise and games the system it's really crucial that the other side doesn't do the same thing that it should continue to play by the rules but in the example of Venezuela but you just given us the government is packed the courts and figured out ways to exclude the opposition\nShe tries to play by the rules does not just give the government license to run roughshod certainly it does now but in the beginning\nThe opposition had a chance and particularly after that coup when things had blown up and the last patients basically and went through a non democratic maneuver to remove him which was a military coup d'etat\nWhen that didn't work and he came back they had a chance to negotiate basic changes in the rules in who would be appointed to the courts and that kind of thing but instead they still wanted to focus on removing him from power\nA shop is Doug in himself so both sides dug in in this\nKind of existential fight to eliminate the other rather than walking back and trying to work together again and over time this\nPolitical fight got infused into the society said that the citizens themselves became just as divided in fact neighborhoods families were divided\nCaracas itself you would go to one area of town and the restaurants were only for the people who were you know anti Chavez you go to another area of town and that was only for pro shop as people\nAnd people would be tackled and harassed if they tried to cross over so over time yes the opposition lost those battles in trying to remove schottische Chavez consolidated his power and excluded them to carry it out and it became more and more authoritarian said that they fight very well\nA democratically through elections by the time you get up to the present day\n... of course has since died things have gotten no better in fact probably worse under his yes successor Nicolas Maduro but let's step back a bit when you're talking about polarization that we're using to describe because not just political extends to society in general\nExactly and\nAre difficult to result you know one way to define polarization is just differences and the growing distance in political leaders political parties beliefs in attitudes on specific issues if it's just that\nIt's possible you know to look for compromises and to negotiate for for people to choose okay we're going to like this party now and go in this direction and uh we don't like that next time around will elect a different party going in a different direction\nWhen it gets to this more emotional level what we call aspect of polarization because it it involves feelings an aspect that's when we get into tribalism\nAnd we dislike and we just stressed and were suspicious of the other team the

Employee Benefit plan in twenty fourteen and when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand\nThat plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us\nWho get our health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care\nAnd so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently she had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a math nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare published as its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid\nWell and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the health care industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are five times and Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to exist\nThat many hospitals there surely would be a hospital that would just say listen our prices are price it took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals\nShe called them the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign statewide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs Maryland would\nSay absolutely yes her message really to employers as you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contracts\nYou need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high and get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do that you know you may need to the smaller employers may need to join together with other small employers to increase their leverage but they can bring down the prices\nMarshall Allen at ProPublica thanks very much\nThanks so much Steve\nProgramming and supported by Thompson writers practical law connect combining curated practical long no how and west long

but then\nThey sort of got brighter and brighter and then they stalled out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal as it to see strictly to see her name attached to the Nobel Prize in physics\nWell this is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in the past hundred and Fifteen Years while uh the the last one was in Nineteen sixty three it's a done a strict than was asked about this in the press conference in even she seem a bit surprised by that\nFact you are the sad woman ever getting\nLet's get comments on that ... okay I thought there might have been more but I think\nIt is true yeah there's only days you others in Nineteen sixty three in Nineteen oh three and there have been many good female physicists who has been widely held were overlooked\nDoes surprise does this suggest a an advancement for women physicists\nI'd say it's more like the Nobel Prize is trying to stay relevant in the heart scientists especially ah Internet entrepreneur and started this new age we're in have started giving their

it made it bearable will for kids ... they can handle the truth they can much better than adults can you find that when you talk to kids when you're out and about mhm\nYeah it's true and I think that as soon as you grow up you want to forget that because you don't want to remember just how intense it is\nAnd how alive you are and so you there's a part of you that shuts down as an adult and the kids aren't aren't shut down yet they're open to the wonder and the majesty and everything but we become more and more afraid as we\nAs we get older and we closed down more and more so now that Louisiana has been seen mhm\nDo you suppose you're going to go back\nIn and have these other characters perhaps bubble up and maybe do some more sequels because you're getting so good at it\nNow [laughter]\nThat's very clever very clever way to put that good there anything is possible anything on [laughter] I'm not closing the door on anything but so and and um and I've learned to never say never 'cause I never thought I Would do this\nTo unionize that would make a meaningful difference\nAbility to organize and get their wages up which by the way has a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S will be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot of details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor

scientific analysis for fine art they're based in New York and Philadelphia\nAnd they're here for two days on campus and um yesterday and uh we spent all day with the painting\nAnd first we removed

Bush a call for it after Anita Hill's testimony\nUm it didn't it was limited to for Dave they only took four days\nAnd apparently that's all they needed so basically would call me and saying is for Democrats not to worry and for Republicans not to rejoice just yet because the FBI is very capable of doing what it needs to do and whatever time it is a lot of gay given to do it\nAnd the fact that the FBI is not going to be allowed to allow itself to be used as a political pawn or cover up for either party\nA Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's on the floor of the Senate right now speaking about the Kavanaugh vote and investigation he's saying is that they're going to vote this week the FBI I don't think has\nHas um ... told him that they are going to be completed with the investigation although\nThey were given a week unless they needed more ...\nLike I it always seems like the the capital state is already decided and the fact that that the majority leader's called for both my understanding is that vote they're talking about this week perhaps as a front friday\nIt changed my life [laughter] still laughing oh my gosh I saw a cut of Matt Damon playing judge Kavanaugh wow what if you didn't want to do it well now see\nIt was delicious it really was I mean it was just all the stereotypes I think that sometimes I look I think that Saturday Night live for the most part has has\nEnded its yes is relevant agree ...

about that this morning six five one to two seven six thousand on Twitter at\nCarry NPR an anywhere in the region eight hundred two for two twenty eight twenty eight Amanda Terkel is with us She's Washington bureau chief for the Huffington Post and she joins us today from DC Amanda welcome good at it in the show\nThanks for having me Mary Kate Cary is with us She's a columnist and contributing editor at US News and World Report and a former speechwriter for President George W Bush and\nCo host of the podcast that I listen to called bipartisan Mary Kay welcome it's good to have you on the show\nThanks for having to ... marry Kate I'm curious about whether polls are giving you much insight on the political effect of this Kavanaugh situation because or is it or is it just so dynamic it's really hard to see polls I mean the Quinnipiac is saying\nYou know forty eight percent or saying he shouldn't be confirmed is this moving too quickly to really believe what the polls are saying\nYeah I I absolutely think that and I think there's a lot of people who are watching this very quietly and are afraid to say what they really think to a pollster why whether it's about Trump or about cabinet\nRight and some of the terms if you heard Senator McConnell just now on the on the Senate floor I was listening to him before we came on the air and he was quoting some of the things that people on the other side are saying um in terms of\nIf you support Kavanaugh your complicit in the evil that you're part of the destruction of the constitution and things like that so so that makes people really pipe down and not say what they think that the number that was more interesting to me\nThan the polls was when we saw that the Thursday hearing where the world stops reality watch uh the the highest rated a show for watching it was on Fox News and that\nTells me there's a lot of people on the other side who are watching this on the on the right side watching this and and being very quiet about it and not say what they really think\nOr matter to me as a more interesting number yeah Amanda what does that tell you a lot of ... we actually recently\nDid um our own toll on this and\nIt was a little bit different we found that nearly foreign ten a people we pulled said they could identify with either a bloody Ford or cabinet and it was perhaps\nNot surprisingly a lot of women said they could identify with Ford saying that they were victims of sexual assault and they had never told anyone uh and so to hear her speak up it was incredibly powerful this is sort of an effect that you had after Anita Hill testified in Ninety One right\nAnd on the other side you had a lot of men saying they identified with Brett Kavanaugh\nBecause they were afraid that behavior that they had done similar things and they thought people could misconstrued or it could hurt their chances a one on a guy said to us I Know how women will lie I've had it happened to me I'm a white male with some power\nWho has done some bars things in the past so you know both sides you had people ah you know that's really\nIn little falls a high can have you voted already or are not made that that that decision yet\nYou know I have not voted but I have made a decision\nWhere are you on the political spectrum is if I may as well\nI did not vote for Trump and two thousand six thing I didn't vote against him but I didn't go corn um but I think that I Will vote straight Republican this time\nBecause I was told the hearing was totally unfair central um son's name and a letter for weeks in you know and they're totally unfair I mean this has got a wife and two children that set down those hearings and\nAnd let me play a Mary Kate what President Trump said about this and then ask you for some thoughts on what Amanda just said here's a President Trump yesterday in that press conference on Kavanaugh\nBut I can tell you I watch that hearing and I'll watch the man's saying that he did have difficulty as a young man would drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty live Twenty years because nobody said anything bad about him in many many years they go back to high school\nYou know I graduated from high school and and I I while I did not drink I saw a lot of people drink they drink beer and then go crazy and you know there were not just go there were sixteen Seventeen years old and I saw a lot of it\nDoes that mean that they can't do something that they want to do with their life so it's very tough and\nI I don't know if that was helpful or not to Kavanaugh Mary Kate how does\nWowed me a bit of a mixed bag but that's common with our president [laughter] um but I I I Do think you know I'm I'm right in a one person removed from a lot of these people I I grew up here in Washington\nJimmy aside and all these schools that we are talking about running Maryland side\nSo she'll be played football against him but I didn't socialize with them\nBut I I feel like a lot of my friends from college knew all these guys in high school and and a lot of the girls too and and so it's a fact that just about everyone Kavanaugh has known over the the majority of his life male and female have spoken out about his good judgment and his integrity\nSeems to have gotten completely lost by\nOne or two people coming forward with these unfounded allegations and and and that is I think what the president was trying to say is at what point do you talk about his judicial opinions instead of drinking games in\nIn high school um and I think a lot of that that that that rings true to me that at what point do you say OK\nHigh school is high school ah and and let's talk about his judicial opinions that is assuming he didn't do anything horrendous in high school but if we're talking about the smaller things like Amanda you're just referring to\nUm you know the definition of ... and all those kinds of stuff but then at what point do you say okay the patches of past and let's talk about uh the important things\nSo I think that's what the president is trying to say and I and I think a lot of people feel that way too but we got to wait and see what the FBI comes up with before we can make a decision like that\nHere Steven Rochester who called and say I voted for Obama twice I've been DFL all my life this has caused me to make up my mind to vote Republican down the line in terms of all the candidates on the ticket why isn't anyone talking about Keith Ellison despite police reports about him and\nSteve I Would just say plenty of people were talking about Keith Ellison the investigation was completed and\nAh there is a decision being made about whether to send that on to law enforcement so there's been news coverage of that to the phones to Gabe in e Dinah high gay appreciate your waiting\nThanks good morning morning what what are you thinking about here is is what's happening not just the allegations but the

on Fox News said that\nUh he had talked with his daughters and they started telling him things and they're teenagers about what goes on at their school and he was pretty shocked and and he said that we\nYou can't discount the conversation that this is starting and that it's getting more women to speak up and you're seeing as you start with that need a hill where a lot of the male senators just\nDidn't understand what women were going through a sexual harassment you're finding that now with a lot of the male politician saying you should have reported it at the time Donald Trump's reaction was well if this really happened if this was actually serious\nI have no doubt that Christine Blasey Ford and her loving parents would have reported it is just not true you fight you know many many sexual assault so underreported and women understand why and it seems that a lot of men do\nMary Kay you mentioned earlier that that you're the mom to a couple of daughters how old are they if I could ask\nThere are Twenty one and twenty three so one's in college ones out\nWhat's the conversation beyond who's going to get confirmed been like with them [noise]\nUm you mean about the political parties are about sexual assault\nI'm about sexual assault and power over women because this is for me the one I I agree with what Amanda saying beyond the politics this is the cultural you know beginning of change that's happening so tell me what they're saying to you about that\nUm there's two two things\nA lot about um Harvey Weinstein and to me too movement when it first started and I told them they had not yet really worked in offices yet and so there were still students and I said you guys are never going to have to deal with\nWomen are age have had to deal with over the years\nAnd and this is a great time to be a young woman entering the workforce because times are totally changing\nAnd thank God for these women who are speaking up the second thing though is both of them went to the University of Virginia one still there and saw up close that Rolling Stone piece and what happened and you\nHave a first hand they knew a lot of the boys who were wrongfully accused of gang rape and got you know so relieved when it all fell through and the and the boys were totally exonerated so they're more aware than most girls I think of\nWhat happens when this goes wrong and and and very conscious of why someone would make a false accusation and and they think usually it's because they're unstable or have other things going on in their lives and and that they're very conscious of that\nAnd very sympathetic to ah people who are struggling like that so\nIt's um it it's been a unique situation for them I think of as opposed to girls that other colleges and other places\nI call here from Caitlin in Chisholm Hi Caitlin how law thank you for taking my call or what are you thinking about you listen to our discussion\nWell I'm very happy especially as a woman I feel I'm and I have I personally I Would probably identify myself or moderate but right now any Democrat um my dad is very hard to write a conservative and\nTry to have these conversations with him to try to understand where I'm coming from because I hear a lot of his um you know justifications all why didn't you report why didn't do this\nI Know there are so many different reasons why we do but I just feel that the Republicans are right well I've been very dismissive of Dr Ford and that and I'm\nColts will watch and I also feel just a judge Kavanaugh's demeanor during the whole uh testified during his testimony and everything it spoke volumes as well as far as you know is he fit you judge a little judges are supposed to be called cool collected and I didn't see any of that\nDuring his testimony ...\nToward the Democrats that I'll definitely you voted Democrat as fall\nCaitlin appreciate the call Mary Kate in Amanda this is why we're however the confirmation vote goes it doesn't and

H R go healthcare education software we're diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology in healthcare learn more at your age are go dot com trained to to spot it and do something about it\nAbsolutely I definitely agree with that um I think part of the issue also unfortunately is the fear of ... the topic uh when it comes to suicide ... ah you have to be concrete in very specific in the\nTalks that you have with an individual that you might be concerned about um any kind of vague um approach to the topic um has to be put to the side you have\nTo be very violent and corruption many example I'm now ... what some vague approach to this the done work\nAnd so a lot of it has to do with just specifically working within the athletic population in general um athletes have a tendency to 'em for the most part recognize the confidence level of the person sitting in front of them\nThough whether you're a practitioner or a clinician who's trained or whether you're a coach or an allied staff member if they sense any um\nLevel of a lack of confidence in being able to say hey I really need to ask you some really tough questions um and I need you to be a hundred per cent honest with me have you had thoughts of you know in your life um do you have thoughts of hopelessness do you have concerns where you're not able to have\nA future oriented thinking um those are some real concrete questions to be able to ask it's not enough to just you know say hey how're you doing man\nThat's a very vague approach to a real serious concern that you might have for someone um because you know oftentimes specifically what I said earlier is when a person has made up their mind to end their life there's actually\nA sense of relief that comes with it and so while we may be afraid to broach the conversation when they're in the the doubt\nWhere they are completely elated and they have almost like the sense of resolve that are at the peak moments to really identify where they've already made up in their mind that they have a plan and they have a sense of relief and everything is going to be OK so and so just being extremely mindful of that I think that the previous caller who talked about the mental\nMental health first aid really um has touched on a lot you know there are things that people can do in terms of cue PR training you don't have to be a clinician to be able to be trained and some of this stuff and you know one of the things that we always emphasize an advocate for again it's been called for being comfortable with the conversation\nAt not shy away from it um helps tremendously I'm I think the other thing too also a\nReally take into consideration is that you know no matter what you do um\nIf a person has a made up their mind to do it um and they have a plan they have a means those are the types of questions that you need to ask\nIs not just a you have a plan but what is your plan what is the duration for your plan like do you have a set time or location you've got to get really specific in these questions\nEric ... says my sons had the benefit of many good coaches that appreciated the quote molding young men role\nBut I never heard anything specific from my boys about mental health I Do believe my college son gets some of that and there's one on ones with his position coach however Brent White where what do you think of the parents role in this is this something that parents can be probing for when their kids are playing sports ... at whatever level\n[noise] and what the research shows is to a specially for ... they're less likely to recharge your friend or family member\nUnfortunately bitter or if he goes back to the student ... ... they're probably going to recharge your culture or family member before they reach out to a ...\nThe parent what you're listening for is those changes in behavior is your son or daughter more withdrawn I'm have they lost an interest in things that they were typically you interested in ... in looking for\nSome of those changes be on performance 'cause obviously transitioning to college it's difficult as difficult as an athlete so performance is going to suffer but some of those activities that they enjoy the outside of sport whether it be related to music or the things that they just regularly did for fun or they no longer\nExcited about those things have they\nCompletely lost interest in those you're looking in those types of changes are they not um\nThat are they not talking to the friends that they normally talk to so some of those telltale signs with there may be something going\nOn the other thing and and I don't think that with specific enough and the question I'm also interested in whether\nParents should be a on the alert for coaches or teacher coaches who are not or are you know I'm providing this access I guess I'm asking this because\nMaybe your child would tell the coach something that they might not\nReveal to you is this something that parents can look for like what kind of a relationship what kinds of things does that coach talk about when it comes to mental health or or or not\nBut the it's difficult in terms of coaches coaches probably are going to well it depends on the department sometimes they are going to openly discuss mental health and discuss the policies that's the ideal scenario that's not going to be that the case every place you have\n'em but I think what you're looking forward and coaches is a let's say for instance somebody suffers a head injury they have a concussion and what we know about concussions is that there are differences depression is associated with a concussion or how does a coach respond if you are\nYou are showing signs of being hopeless or are you getting a\nUm George dude is responding to that and trying to connect you to resources or\nDo you get any response little coaches saying hey this is part of the ground you have to suck it up and get in there I'm listening to through your children's response waters the response we're getting from the coaches are I think that's going to be one of the hot it demeaned indicators\nMarissa says um I used to be a student athletes and I've coached to summer youth swimming league\nA level in hockey and he's on a triple a team that he knew the really really want it to be on\nThe ... yeah that sounds like a really formative experience at a young age for your son I mean you know you could have gone either way right\nRight right and well he's a he's a very kind hearted like soft hearted kids so we were just like okay this is going to be it's going to be make or break for him you know kind of like his outlook on things and um but you know thankfully people around us in the school were able to support him and get them through it\nAnd um he's thriving now so it's it was it was a very good thing but it really opened my eyes to how it can affect somebody that young too\nGood to have your call it the brunt I hear her when she says this is kind of a make or break thing at age nine I mean here's what we're talking about his confidence level not just in sports but you know when everything else right academics and a and a lot of different parts of your life and that's a big deal at that age\nSearch without an open conversation and let the coach knew what he was dealing with the coach should know the background information\nHe may assume the his withdrawal practices simply lack of interest for work or motivation women for you know he was dealing with a very serious boring issue outside of the sport no red open communication is critical and in\nHelping the coach handle the situation handle the weight practice girls\nUm but yeah it's definitely the case where um the sport aspect can be confident Wilbur\nAngel ... what do you think the professional sports industry what kind of message do you think it it often send to kids Mickey's age or young you know uh athletes who aspire to something in college or beyond\nWell I think it also kind of goes back to what was mentioned earlier with one of the other callers in terms of the anticipation\nOf what this looks like if I have something on my record because I Do have these aspirations to pursue sport at the next level whether it's pursuing it at the college level or Brazil and get a professional level where the rosters are not as um the heavy and deep in terms of the ... shark\nAnd so um the higher up the level of sport participation the the more\nI'm critical an athlete may be in terms of making sure that they have a quote unquote clean record 'em I think it it it backs to differ just because this is a fishbowl culture which means on the surface level it looks like there's a lot of poking prodding in terms of\nProfessional athletes and in living on a certain stage where they're pretty vulnerable to other people's\nOpinions and people thinking that they know what's going on with them but I think it's also important for a professional organizations to emphasize and really\nBackground work that's being done I think it's time to move the needle on the conversation when it comes to behavioral health concerns and not just addressing issues from a PR perspective when things are happening and people have questions about the organization but really being more\nProactive in educating the public about some of their programming that they do have in place you know like your\nRookie success programming um that takes place within an NFL um the NFL actually has a former player who um takes on the the role of when it comes to a developing mental health programs and making connections with community based providers to provide support\nServices for a lot of their players whether it's with the NFL P. A. or not and this is just the NFL in general but there are a lot of programs that are actually being built upon right now but it's just not getting a lot of publicity for it um we only hear about the mental health concerns\nWithin pro sports when it becomes a crisis that\nNationally Iraq we write yeah he's out in the NBA\nHas done the same thing they've done a great job of\nBringing on board I'm a great colleague a bill ... who is heading up for the MBTA their mental health initiative for a lot of their player association members as well as the NBA has now um started um hiring on clinicians to be a part of each organization and so there's a lot of\nWork that's being done you're just not hearing about it\nBrings a really good point there um it it could the NFL again I'm taking this from a interviews that I've read you know fairly recently about NFL players who say they talk a good game but it's really a culture that you keep this to yourself and\nI mean I was reading something that Randy Gregory of the Dallas Cowboys said it's trash it's punitive that's my experience do you see that the NBA is doing something that the the NFL might learn from here\n[noise] I mean if we could\nTook in hiring part part of him as a director of a mental health and wellbeing as a a critical first step because it's a very complicated if the professional level because if you take a professional athlete first of all with it even within the team it's a challenge\nBecause if you have a player who is seeking out help in the organization knows\nWhen it comes time to renegotiate their contract that information is there unfortunately and I I've actually had GM's telling me that you know if I have that information that does influence in a negotiation process as bad as that is\nThat's why the director of mental health and wellbeing position that ... stepped into in the NBA is so critical because it's an outside resource cause the other thing that happens for a professional athlete is it's not as simple as you just simply walk into a psychologist office because there are a lot of people that are going to number one see you go in there\nThey're going to people that are sitting in the waiting room it's it's just not that simple so having that confidential resource that\nCan even exist within the organization or that's where the players association and the leagues\nGet involved um it it is a difficult issue to manage just because my experience in working with\nPlayers at the professional level is that there is a huge concern of who knows my business who knows what's going on and is there anything that can be used against me in a negotiation and the reality is is it in\nFull disclosure of it and and I don't blame them I understand that human nature when someone has diminished ration knows about someone's mental health passed for better or worse that as part of the the negotiation process\nA ... a listener on Twitter he'll be curious about information on that mental health aide Indians mental health\nDo you get more information on that to mark in Minneapolis Hi Mark hey thanks so much for waiting\nJust good morning\nMorning what's your own experience with this you were a coach\nI was a a twenty five year college coach um I live with mental illness myself and\nUm I like your previous caller in on mental health first aid instructor because of the fact that I think we just need to do more education what's coaches um to be able to be comfortable with the conversation to know what science to look for and you know we do a very good job in the sports industry with physical trainers and and physical issues\nBut once it comes to mental issues that's where we really dropped the ball um so I just think we need to continue to educate from the top down administrators coaches\nUm everybody to know that it's okay to hear that it's held against people because um [noise] you know all of their mental health you know we don't hold that against him as much for physical health of those things are much more accepted we have to accept the mental health part of it and get those people that'll help\nI mean mark when you're ... you talked to the athletes in in college and high school about this right don't you sense that there is still a stigma for all of the support that we've been talking about this hour\nPeople there's a lot of consequences to coming forward about this kind of thing too I mean look at what's going to happen to ever send Griffin here this is this will be forever in the minds of fans or potential teams that might want him to play\nIn a U.S that um but I also think the more we have this conversation mode normalize it um we we've seen that in the NHL physical tender with the New York islanders who took a leave last year ... was diagnosed with bipolar and again um he had a lot of next\nBecause she was hiding out so nobody knew what was going on just that this person was acting out who's a bad team made or this or that\nWants to see who your daughter was pulled her kind of explained that he's getting the help he resigned but hundreds which protects includes agreed moved to show that bloom the cabin loves these people that are coming out are helping normalize it and put people to understand that\nOnce you get the help you can function you know does ... she doesn't have to find the person wants to get the help we can go back to participating in 'em and performing like their abilities are\nYou know angel Brent mentioned this at the beginning of the discussion that the athletes who have come out about it I Want to talk to me a little bit about why that is so powerful\nWell it's definitely cathartic number one um when you are able to have a sense of relief I think also it kind of goes back to that fish

F. A. S. and they're linked to a number of illnesses including cancer the\nTrump Administration is working on a plane to regulate them some in Congress are pressing for it to move faster\nNPR's Jeff Brady has been looking into this and joins us now by Jeff Hi Ari but first of all what are these chemicals\nA pie fast it's an entire group of several thousand manmade chemicals in some of them had been around for decades these chemicals are good at Republican oil and water and that makes them really useful for all sorts of products like nonstop cookware coating on fast food rappers pizza boxes\nAnd the places where pie fast says are used in manufacturing those are generally the places that are the most polluted or there's some sites in New York North Carolina Michigan just to name a few places\n... also are in firefighting phone used at airports and military bases in some cases around the country the chemicals have migrated into local drinking water\nAnd the estimates on exactly how many people are affected very but it's safe to say that the numbers and the million how harmful to people can these chemicals be what kinds of problems that cause the research is limited so it's hard to pin down exactly how harmful these chemicals are a scientist will say pee fast is are linked to\nLike a C group called the Silent Spring Institute\nPiece chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer low birth weight thyroid disease elevated cholesterol and effects on the immune system\nManufacturers have agreed to stop using two forms of pee fast in the U. S. but these chemicals take a long time to break down on the environment and that's why they are still a problem now and how regulators responding to this especially given the uncertainty\nThe EPA requires most water utilities to test for a list of ... passes and in twenty sixteen agency lowered a non binding health advisory limit for some ... chemicals\nIt's now Seventy parts per trillion I'm told that it's about Seventy grains of sand and an Olympic size swimming pool\nAnd some environmental advocates argue level should be even lower than that\nBut all this uncertainty it creates confusion especially for water companies like aqua America it's based in suburban Philadelphia Christopher Crockett is the chief environmental officer there and he says companies like his needs clearer direction from the EPA and from policymakers to be able\nTo explain to the public and my above or below a safe level here and do we need to put treatment on in this community and how soon and that still needs to be determined and that needs to be determined\nAs possible now the EPA is working on a plan to manage pretty fast chemicals the agency just wrapped up a series of public meetings around the country the plan is expected by the end of the year the Trump Administration has been so staunchly anti regulation especially rolling back protections meant to keep people safe from environmental contaminants\nWhy are they responding differently to this an issue like this it really fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and toward issues such as clean air and clean water also\nTo manage be fast chemicals and we don't know what that plan is going to look like until it's out some time in the next few months so what could people do to protect themselves today with the water utility aqua that we heard from just a minute ago they've installed these big carbon filters to bring the levels down and that works the utility says the water is safe to drink\nIf you're still worried about it those filters that you get in a refrigerator and water pitchers those will bring the levels down too but I've talked to people here who still just don't trust their water that it's safe and they're continuing to drink bottled water That's NPR's Jeff Brady thanks thank you Ari\nAnd tomorrow we'll visit a

division of the office\nI'm a an attorney that's always been passionate about standing up for the rest of my clients and what I'm going to do as attorney general is stand up for the legal rights of

them within five percentage points of Allison who had a higher unfavorable rating among poll respondents than favorable\nMr Allison is a very extreme\nWard Lowe says the lingering allegation of domestic abuse that an ex girlfriend made against Allison is troubling Ellison has repeatedly denied the allegation and the deal fell hired investigator was unable to substantiate it\nWord law called the investigation a sham and it's still using the issue to hammer Allison\nAll of that is ... is sufficient evidence for the public to conclude that Keith Ellison shouldn't be the state's top law enforcement official and I think that they're going to make that judgment and render that verdict against him in November\nFor his part Allison is trying to paint ward low was the one who is extreme I

and others to label him as a right wing extremist insist that he's neither anti LGBT nor anti union as for the alliance defending freedom ward low is proud of his work there\nIs a great organization that ... fights for important constitutional rights in my work there I I fought for free thought and free speech and free religion First Amendment issues that really should not be controversial\nThere
