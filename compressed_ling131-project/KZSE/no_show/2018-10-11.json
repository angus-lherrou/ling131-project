Ryan company's plans to build a mix of homes offices and retail on that one hundred twenty two acre parcel but as Matt Sepic reports many residents\nThe impact of thousands of new residents in workers and their cars nearly seven years ago the last Ford Ranger pick up trucks ruled out of the St Paul assembly plant\nThe buildings are long gone and environmental cleanup crews have been removing contamination so homes and other kinds of businesses can go there last night executives of developer Ryan Companies outlined what they hope to build Tony bronco heads real estate development for the for him\nHe says in addition to offices in retail they'll put up thirty eight hundred homes\nWere going to have seniors housing or going to have row homes which will be a very attainable price point for both new families and for people looking to downsize or maybe not take care of a lawn we will have affordable housing at multiple different income levels\nBronco says Ryan plans to build about two hundred fewer homes than what the St Paul city council allowed in the master planet approved last year\nThat plan has been controversial among residents of the surrounding highland park neighborhood in part because it allows maximum building heights of ten stories\nYou know not to those concerns Mike Ryan who heads the ferns north region says the tallest structure is on the site will be just six stories and designers are taking pains to ensure all their brand new architecture fits in with the neighborhood that was built out in the Nineteen thirties and forties\nWe we're not going to introduce an architectural character that was wildly distinct from the neighborhood as we really want it to be and reflect that charming streetcar suburb that that theory is\nRyan says two of Ford's three baseball fields will remain the southern most one will go in order to extend Montreal avenue in to the side from the east Creighton avenue will connect into the new neighborhood from North Ryan says bicycle and pedestrians paths will crisscross the site there will be green space\nFocal point and also manage storm water runoff\nBut many highland park residents still worry about all the extra traffic the new residents and businesses will generate\nThe site is not freeway accessible Charles Hathaway with neighbors for a livable St Paul is concerned that the areas to major arteries Ford parkway increase revenue will get even busier he likes that Ryan is proposing last density in the city planning allows but ... says there's just not enough space\nThe central problem here is putting so many people in a relatively small parts of the land and it's far far higher than anything that highland has right now\nOver the last year other St Paul residents have spoken out in favor of dense development Tom Romans who lives near the site on the Mississippi River boulevard says the plan Ryan outlined last night is a good compromise\nThis is a sweet spot that's probably not going to please both groups but it's a nice middle\nRyan company's vice president of marketing Claire Scott says managing traffic remains a concern for planners she says the impact could be mitigated if some new residents relied a bit less on driving\nWhat we're finding in the market is that like having your car and sending it to ... so it's not necessarily to able to make it to people with twenty\nScott says a study of how the project will affect traffic will get underway next month\nShe says Ryan expects to finalize a deal with Ford to buy the land by the end of the year there's no from construction timeline yet but Scott says initial work on the site could begin in about a year Matt Sepic of Minnesota Public radio news St\nSee what he's been saying about the north Korea and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist and Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase the pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nIndividual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore um look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific um\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies conflict abroad by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran or at it after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about the enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs the government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that did that surprise you in some way\nCertainly um but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of his job um he was defending a lot of his friends who were opponents of the Saudi regime or he has a lot of friends in the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be a a real problem\nFor the Saudis the Saudis over reacted to the Canadians are when the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior you will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that were detained\nOr in the rich Carlton there were some reports of torture when that occurred didn't stop the U.S Saudi relationship from being extremely strong\nAnd

that and if you like listening to it one eight hundred to two seven to eight one one or go to NPR News dot org slash donate\nStuff I think we ought to go back to this conversation about the ... bill the of a childcare in rural Minnesota now here's the problem companies want to attract young workers who are willing to stick around for a long time\nBut in these places that are known in some areas is childcare desert it's a really hard thing to do how do you have to braid from first children's finance was on the show and told me what some companies are doing to bring in and keep young families\nWere starting to see the private sector getting involved in childcare because it impacts their bottom line they may very may well loved children [laughter] but they really care about retaining and attracting their own workforce and childcare is a strategy to do that that\nAnd I was wondering if if that's one of the solutions that I Want to talk about this hour which is local employers contribute to a fund\nThrough I don't know you know tax assessments or through contributions that supports the ... the establishment of childcare and towns where there aren't many options do you see any of that going on our employers taking a more activist role in this so I think\nPut emphasis on starting okay hum\nAre starting to take daycare as a serious consideration and the overall benefits package and I think that's in part because it has gotten to the point where women and men are being forced to off ramp their careers in order to take care of children because they realize that\nThey're spending either entirely too much time and putting their actual work in jeopardy or they simply are using their entire salary to fund daycare um\nSo I think it's becoming even a bigger issue when it comes to retaining quality talent and ensuring that they can move to the next level so I think you are seeing some employers and part of the problem though is that oftentimes adding in daycare as an added benefit is an easier thing for a massive company to do a massive\nIncredibly profitable company um and sometimes the argument that smaller companies make is that their margins are just\nTighter it's harder for them to add in benefits especially benefits that are so costly as we know childcare is it's a very labor intensive um practice especially if it's how you said we have people who really wanted these roles looking after these kids and\nYou know forming their critical development at age is there to five so it's something that we're seeing but it's certainly something that I think workers aren't seeing implemented as quickly or on as wide scale as they would want\nYou to just called from Minneapolis to say earlier in the show a woman said that a business didn't come to a small town because of lack of daycare that was that clip we played a from I think a show that Chris feral dead and\nA due to the asks why didn't the business invested in a daycare themselves wouldn't that have been to their advantage in the long run what do you tell employers about this Heidi\nWell I don't mind employers that that that they are the ultimate beneficiary of childcare it ensures that down a lot of different ways yeah yeah their employees are at work\nReliable childcare so it isn't the best interests to figure out ways to support that in a community and we're seeing all kinds of really wonderful things start to pop up in Minnesota is cities and counties across rural Minnesota are getting into this issue\nThey're finding creative ways to address that in local economic development that yeah I have one on the city of Arlington and simply county has a forgivable loan program that provides a thousand dollars of incentive financing for new providers\nUm west central initiatives and kind of like the west central part of of Minnesota has a forgivable loners I Need I noticed on the map I Will lay off ... county has a tax abatements policy that for the first time includes childcare businesses and they're also getting involved in providing bonding to find a childcare facility and\nThey're engaging the private sector because they can't be the full solution but they're starting to engage private sector communities really big and small and medium I businesses as well so we're starting to see a couple of those things\nI generate inside of our own states to the phones to Tracy in cold Spring Harbor Tracy what's your experience with this\nWell hello this is a great conversation I think it's really important I'm actually a previous childcare provider I opened up a business in my home\nAnd the reason I really open the business was because in my area there wasn't enough daycares and the people that I ... I didn't think were qualified enough to raise my precious baby uh-huh open my my own daycare and I have a little insight into why it is so expensive\nI Would um when a parent pays their weekly fee it may seem\nA little high and maybe you feel like you're paying too much per hour for the parent to take care of that person to take care of your child that you have to keep in mind that that weekly feet doesn't cover any retirement benefits or\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ... H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learn more at your age are go dot com\nChildcare provider pay is that or mix that's really not that much money um\nAnd actually what got me out of the business was because if you can imagine a parent working a forty hour week\nUm and then my small community people usually commute to the larger town so they would usually drop their child off about an hour before work and pick 'em up an hour after which leaves that childcare provider working at fifty hour week of the ours is only with face time with kids [noise] plus\nAbout you know how best that they've either fed and not necessarily respecting their wishes it puts these women breastfeeding relationship at risk um a lot of temp threatening at first useful below that they're not interested in doing and I don't need to\n'em and they don't feel like they can just say let me go find another ... this is there one\nI I mean this is this is kind of dovetails with what we just said about infant care and why it's so expensive Heidi and then you layer on the issue of\nI Want to be able to breastfeed through certain amount of months for my child but the childcare provider has to work with me on this ... is Dana right when she says you run out of options pretty quick\nAbsolutely infant care is really hard to find why on because it it deserves the attention of a few more adults\nSo we don't want sixty kids I sixty babies in a room being watched by two people have ... so the best thing is that we have\nA safe and healthy places for ...\nIn charge of them so and family childcare at it restricts the number of babies who can be inside of that license in a childcare center in Minnesota it's a one to four ratio and if you're looking at best practice recommendations they're saying one adult for every three babies\nSo those labor costs are really high and the flights I've limited it is the most expensive kind of care because it doesn't break even um I work on the business side of childcare and we refer to infant care almost like the last leader in a grocery store it's the milk and eggs\nIt you hope that you recoup\nThat investment onto that child as they stay in your program because you can make money perhaps when they are taught alert or preschool it's very hard for infant care to break even because that that number slots are are limited for good reason\nSo I mean is this a case where you might have a facility and part of it is just infant care and you're losing money on that yeah but the rest of the facilities for older kids and you kind of ... rates yeah that's a long time to lose money on what's the solution to that\nWell you have to find a business model that works and so serving\nA primarily infants and toddlers can be a struggle for lots of communities because you just can't roll out lots and lots of slots you need a lot of adults who are qualified to do that work and so it really requires people to get I'm\nVery fiscally minded when they are putting together their business plans for childcare\nYou what the problem with this isn't the Julian go ahead I I was just going to say we're not a country that really supports along maternity leave so if you want to go back and you have to go back\nTo work and you're looking for infant care man what a struggle absolutely and one of those things\nBecause if and care I think is truly the beginning and the crux of issue it's the most expensive it's the hardest to find and if you were in a city or if you're outside\nOf how do you saying there there's a limited number of slots for two reasons one because it's incredibly expensive to run as a business so often times a day care center will have\nA small number of infants lots and then a larger operation for older kids one to fulfill the regulation that there are high that there's a high proportion of adults to babies but also because\nIt's a last category but then not having a ton of spots especially if there aren't that many daycare facilities available means that when you have a baby the ability to find care for that child after your two or three month maternity leave yeah\nIt's over becomes incredibly difficult because those spots are snapped up by other people so it really compounds the problem right at the beginning where you most need help with daycare where you most need quality daycare and when you're already trying to adjust to this higher cost of living with this new little person ...\nCall here from Heidi in Duluth ... it it sounds like you want to talk about the maternity leave part of this too yeah yeah I\nI mean I Can't believe that still in this country we don't have maternity leave um and and more help wish or if the child care situation up until children go to school and and it's just like every other country has triggered this so why haven't we\nLet's ask our guests Heidi why haven't we figured this out wow that's a great question and I I I Hope we're on pathways to to get there but um\nI don't know why we haven't figured that out I don't have a good answer for that question and I mean what is it about ... is it the way we view a you know corporate independent in ...\nYeah I figure out an answer\nNo I mean I think it's for several reasons I think it's historical I think it's the idea that\nUm after women started heading to the workforce and math no one ever really changed the social contract I think that America is not a particularly strong social safety net country especially when you look at other countries where maternity leave is you know\nPotentially up to a year um and their benefits for fathers and their benefits for caregivers all the way through various stages of life on the United states has never really been a leader in that and I think now we're seeing kind of the pain side of that the economics just don't make sense anymore\nRight Charles in Lake City called the say in Sweden the state pays each parent eighty percent of their wages for two years wow state sponsored parental leave eliminates the need for daycare\nAnd allows parents to spend crucial developmental years with their kids a quick call here from Jeremy in ... how does this work for you Jeremy\nWell my wife and I decided early on before our first child who's or do we have a daughter who is coming up on three years old and a son who will be two years old shortly after that uh-huh we knew at the very beginning that it just didn't make sense for us financially to both work\nDuring the day and even though we would earn more money\n[noise] Ninety five percent of that income would have gone to a daycare provider and so in our minds we were we thought we would just be paying somebody\nSo we didn't have to be with our kids and it just didn't it didn't make sense so I work nights and my wife works days wow yeah it's a little it's a little hard on me that a lot of

been fortunate to have um family members you know be able to buy us like these temporary it's all like a punch card so every now and that our kids can go to like a daycare thing for say a one\nDay out of the week or so yeah for the kind of military help yeah right and\nAnd the flipside of that is because I'm home with them during the day I get to take them to a early childhood education classes\nUCSE class this year in ... county and so it kinda helps out because that wouldn't be available if they were at like a separate daycare thing and then I get to go\nReally good to have your

released its entire fifth season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that fifth season a rough it let's talk about season five\nRight let's get into it [laughter] getting dirty a big\nAmount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself it there's a ... actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nYeah I have to say ah when that line came up at the table read it got um\nProud of people I mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner unimpressed to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a ... a little bit it's it's strange and\nYou know one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nAnd it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just\nYou know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people making it better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had all the uh directors brings so much to the episodes of the story board animators the editors um it it it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd that yes I'm doing all these interviews now talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone who presents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word played the slapstick puns and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes\nHim it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny um but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions\nUm you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's talking octopus or you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals [laughter] um so the story\nIs quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is we're retelling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe lots\nOf animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adults as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television ... who do you see is your four [laughter]\nOh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\nAnd not I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them to shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American audience well I\nI think you know obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I it would be disingenuous for me to claim that\nThat show had had no influence on me or my show or the success of my show\nYou know when one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist outside of\nThe bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first it's going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening it's going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I Want to\nHum and to really take things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously um but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak and he said they are credible princess Carolyn the sort of aging

camera a and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that they you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done lived before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all that stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know I rose up pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our

neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school ... years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of\nPrinting I as a cue cards I've seen her all written in\nAll caps yes correct It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between the between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody else

learn um two or three weeks of training yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interviews ... these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized in during whereas where how to

relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight why near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glasses were your glasses on the show where you were a contacts or you're not worried\nSo okay so you want your glasses so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you didn't want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you can see but that would also make less words in the card and it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we would we would have hearses ride would practice with you if you've never read cue cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because that'll that'll look like you're reading the cue cards\nHow do you mean looking at a rally as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader and I had two guards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the card in the bed later\nThe audience would be like oh he's obviously reading something\nBut if you just played to those two cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the cameras so yeah so I'll I we open depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right size so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live\nThat's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put the cars and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of confer and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I made\nAnd where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical working week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM I Wish

we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only print one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more\nAnd it it'll change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely written from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process reprint put that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it

insights into\nOur American political culture and history to what extent has the United states had a conservative political tradition does it go back to the founding era and the writing of the constitution\nAnd how is that reflected in today's politics\nUniversity of Texas government professor Jeff to list is out with a new book titles legacies of losing in American politics Tula says losing can become winning over the long term you talked about the book with the University of Minnesota professor Larry Jacobs at an event held this fall at the Humphrey school\nOne of the fundamental arguments with this book is that's been lost in American a thought in American\nAnd it was really the real deepest source for it\nOriginally the anti federal is in the federal is\nIf you take out the question is it a good or bad constitution\nSet that aside for a moment and just say well if we adopt this constitution what is it going to look like what is the country going to look like a hundred years two hundred years from now what are the broad parameters what power going to look like what are we going to be a commercial or rural country are we going to have cities\nAre we going to be big or small all those kinds of broad\nDescriptive questions that don't\nBear upon whether you want it or not they were almost in complete agreement the anti federal ... painted a picture of a future state of affairs that we've actually come to live that was more overtly accurate than the federalist themselves paint it\nThat it would be a nationalizing regime over time it get more and more national that the states would lose power over and over time\nAnd they did that by way of harsh criticism right they were trying to rally Americans to defeat the constitution because it what did you find a way to end because it would have this trajectory so let me ask you this is a\nAnother Ronald Reagan quote it's from Nineteen eighty eight state of union address he Reagan says President Reagan quote were for limited government because we understand as the founding fathers that that is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual\nRight so one of the arguments with a book and this is a little bit more complicated but I think it's easy enough to understand is often we say when an old story isn't quite true and the old story is a kind of unrelenting progressive march [noise]\nThat's not true but to say that is not\nA strong core of truth to the old story so in the book we try to say that there are these two braided traditions but just to say that the losers didn't actually lose as much as we thought\nDoes not mean that the winners didn't actually\nWhen they didn't win as much as we thought but they won so in this braided tradition there is still a trip up a progressive trajectory\nThat is impeded subverted modified altered but there is still a direction to American politics just of the sort that you talked about and that has to do with the fundamental significance\nThat the federal is one no matter at the beginning and we have not actually amended the constitution in ways that actually changes fundamental\nOlder I think for most Americans at the level of\nTheir tangible in everyday life yeah interact with programs like Social Security right which Republican president Richard Nixon\nExpands dramatically by and crude including an automatic cost of living adjustment and includes things like the development of um Medicare and Medicaid after Barry Goldwater loses which\nWas established as a really substantial tied them up program and pretty much every decade has been expanded it was just under ... expanded profoundly a terms of its benefits and the beneficiaries and state power was stripped uh quite considerably\nSo you know you kind of look at that story and you could folding quickly\nDoesn't it look to the libertarian mind like yes okay professor thank you very much we have missed this series of footnotes to American history about ideas and thought but the basic story is one\nI'm an overbearing state it is except that the I Would say that the the the ray of light for the libertarian\n... wouldn't be so much that the the story was ended at the beginning that the state would grow it was the story was ended at the beginning unless we have a revolution\nOr that the national government would be responsible for national problems has a policy matter however or\nIf the national government has several bust argument and conservatives prevail that the national government should for example decentralized policy\nThat is actually well within the bounds of progressive political architecture of the constitution\nUm because there's a difference between as long as you say as long as you can see that it's a national responsibility\nThat means it can be decentralized one ear and centralized another depending on political circumstances that's different than the original argument that the national government can't even do it it's the state government stepped in and you shouldn't even be messing with this stuff 'cause it's none of your business\nThe argument that that has prevailed and you might say keeps expanding is it is the central government's business but how does it is still very much up to up for debate so um what's interesting about this is that means for example because it is the national government's business you even get a Republican president like\nGeorge W. Bush passing a policy of No Child left behind which is a national education policy that we used to think was his local as it should be and then you have Democrats turning around and saying hey maybe we'll just step back to the states\nAs long as it's the national government that that has the authority you can have national or decentralized policies and you can have a very robust concerts\nSo is what you're arguing that liberals have basically one in terms of the\nCentral framework of a national government with national responsibility for Social Security Medicare increasingly Medicaid um you know parts of a K. to twelve education but on how it's done on how it's done that there is a vibrant ongoing aid and the source of that\nIs this conservative tradition that remain right life right yeah so is it really then I'm the most that conservatives can hope for is the kind of um you know kind of do these um ambushes when it comes time to implement policies is that is that they're the greatest possibility\n[noise] well ... in the policy realm as opposed to the constitutional realm\nOr conservatives can do and do do a lot\nSometimes they say you know we've been doing things wrong let's do it a different way and ah let's make the bureaucracy smaller and in some uh places that's being done\nWhat I think it's been the last however is the argument and I think it actually should be lost unless we change the constitution and it's always ... we're in principle always open to changing the constitution even though it's politically\nUnlikely that you would do that by the way it mainly because the conservatives um but the constitution is what set settle the issue of where the authority lies\nBut it's not merely policy matter um you can actually do quite a lot uh now the one exception to this that I find interesting which we do talk about in the book\nIs um you remember the big push back against Obamacare by conservatives it's bad thing national health it's like socialized medicine\nAnd one of the arguments they made against it is it was going to take\nThey were opposed to Medicare when Medicare was proposed\nBut once it's a stab less people get used to it Hamilton mentioned this in the federalist papers and if it's working pretty well for them they're going to like it and so conservatives ended up defending Medicare in their attack on Obamacare and it was partly out of fear by the way that if Obamacare lasted long enough people might like that to\nYour book is I Would say a I'm a helping hand conservatives to show that there is this\nThis um conservative intellectual tradition it deserves more attention but you're also a free with the criticism that the confidence and understanding and using that conservative tradition is is not I'm always there and I actually I think the health care debate\nIs another example both the confusion about Medicare it's a national program\nThis is against conservative principles or the other side of it is that the compromise that rock bottom a made was to include some very significant market mechanisms such as these individual market health insurance exchanges\nAnd this is precisely what is being undermined today by Republican right it is the kind of traditional conservative approach does that fit in this kind of pattern of I I don't accept days Ikle yet or every\nDon't like it does I think that what you're describing now ah has to do with something that is really fairly recent and is not something that is is explicit topic of our book it's sometimes called hyper partisanship other people call it tribalism\nA there's a a a book ah it's even worse than it looks by man and orange ... uh about this if you're interested in the basic idea behind it is that uh if you if you can see your party as tribes\nYou actually don't care so much what they stand for anymore so that what they described in there as you were actually oppose bills that are offered by your opponents that you had\nThat you had designed because you don't want them to get credit for and he'd give they give a lot of examples about like that\nAnd so that puts you in this perverse situation in which Republicans will oppose are Democrats on the ideas that they themselves have previously been four and less often but sometimes the Democrats will do the same thing against Republicans are just because they don't want them to get the credit\nYou're listening to University of Texas government professor Jeff tool is the author of legacies of losing in American politics he spoke this fall with professor Larry Jacobs at the University of Minnesota Humphrey school\nTheir conversation continues in just a few minutes but first\nOn this first day of the fall member Dr Steven John alone with Lauren McCollum hello inviting you to help support this reliable independent news source a service that we know is important to you and it's important to our community and we're asking you now to do what you can\nBy giving at one eight hundred to two seven twenty eight eleven a gift in any amount or NPR News dot org slash donate\nYou know have you noticed the changing of the weather a lot of risk out there so here's the deal for you you can get our socks that shell this is the time of year when people actually have to put their soccer that on NPR customs tax it's a bonus gift today only\nBy LBJ and so yes he lost in sixty four big because people disagreed with the with what they thought his policies were or no question\nThe book is the reason they thought what his policies that ... ah where are the way they were is because he chose to present himself in a certain way\nAnd he got to do that because of the creation of a new outside organization in the Republican Party that did not in fact are ... ... ... represent the mainstream views of the country or even of the party at that time\nAnd so the way that happened all adds up to him presenting something which you rightly described as something people reject but it turns out that those same mechanisms then\nHelp build the infrastructure of the conservative movement that bin produces Ronald Reagan later so\nThis kind of forthright style here's our agenda were not compromising on it and as well as the kind of energizing of conservative activists to kind of comments or the party and\nAnd to have actual institutions that they built from the ground up to do it including publications think tanks all the stuff that is now often associated with the conservative movement started with Goldwater\nAnother question along those lines do you think the terms liberal and conservative have evolved over time\nYeah um and uh uh\nThink I I think they have for two ways ah some of which we've talked already\nAbout and the other is would be an elaboration of what I was referring to as this sort of complicated braiding of these two traditions\nAnd the point I Would make about that is the way I've been speaking here it sounds as if a progressive there one thing and conservatives or something else well it turns out when you look across the American political history\nProgressives have as part of their history what might be called a conservative or even anti liberal\nOn the other side conservatives or even what some people might recall think of his reactionary have as part of their history moments that have progress what we would think of his progressive policies are progressive attitudes are progressive uh aspects\nUm and so are the ones simplification I Would caution against is the hardening of these two traditions as as just liberal and conservative when in fact each of them is a little bit more complicated\nLittle more complicated I think that's one of the really tremendous contributions to this book is to take our sometimes oversimplified and as you've been describing incorrect um understandings of liberal and particularly conservative\nTraditions and shining a light on that another question from our audience um there's been a lot of talk or buy a members of the Republican Party about their support for Supreme Court nominees\nWho take a literal or originalist approach to reading the constitution\nDoes that fit into the conservative tradition that you've described\nUm well\nThere's the does the critique or does the action of when you see Republicans stepping forward saying I support Supreme Court ah nominees who will take a literal list interpretation of the constitution were tired of these liberals\nYou know reading into the constitution what they want let's go back to the original constitution is that is that part of this conservative tradition or it\nAnd no so uh one of the things I described in this book that begins the whole chapter on the founding part is a moment in justice Scalia's descent\nObamacare and you might remember that Justice Scalia and the other dissenters\nWere against this because it seemed to them to violate the commerce clause\nAnd what they were objecting to is the part of the healthcare law that mandates that you have to buy insurance or pay a fine what some kinds known in the news you may have heard of is the individual mandate and they said that that was\nAn offense to the constitution because\nThey said that it wasn't regulating commerce it was making you participate in commerce and they thought that that was a it couldn't be justified by the constitution and you might have heard that Scalia raise something he called the broccoli horrible does anybody know that\nThat was supposedly if you did this\nThen the government if it decided we had a health care crisis that could make it to tell everybody they had to buy broccoli it'd be healthier\nAnd surely we don't think the government can tell you to do stuff like that so we can't tell you to buy insurance\nAt now what's interesting is ... actually thought interestingly enough and and the all the conservatives thought that under the constitution that would be that they didn't necessarily think good public policy but it would be legal\nFor the Congress to pass a socialized medicine a centralized provision of health care like Medicare for all\nThey said but this market driven which is interesting less intrusive\nA compromise to the uh they said no because it forces you to participate in Congress in in support of that he decided to go back to the frame hers and ... and back to the federal ... papers that I've been referring to\nAnd he goes back to one number in which ah ah he quotes Hamilton referring to the possibility that the commerce clause but we'd be distorted all out of shape and it's a very vivid metaphor\nInterpretation or what she uses a ... in support of his view that supposedly the original understanding of the commerce clause was very limited and the reason that we use this in the book is the words the quotes are accurate\nBut they're not what Hamilton thought they are Hamilton quoting the anti federalist\nCriticizing the ... of criticizing what it would mean to have this constitution and the entire paper that they're drawing from is an argument against that a ... a against that anti federalist position\nUm and so ah Scalia has actually appropriated the words of the federal is for an anti federalist a conclusion\nGod this book is filled with so many aren't as um and you know I think reading through it it's\nVery very clear and kind of highlighting these ironies between what we assume today a Justice Scalia or Ronald Reagan versus the actual history and it's quite eye opening up I Want to bring in um\nYour earlier book rhetorical presidency\nUm and in that book you make a quite compelling argument that there's been profound change in the nature of presidential leadership to go back to the nineteenth century\nThe norm was that presidents would avoid public appeals\nIn fact you know right on the cusp of the civil war you describe protesters coming to the White House to ask a Abraham Lincoln the president to speak to the looming civil war\nAnd president steps out and says can't talk about it because talked about that would raise all sorts of complicated issues and it's not a\nSince we're expected to use written appeals and they were expected to collaborate with lawmakers in Congress and a kind of\nYou know um we can work this out here let's not a play that demagogue a cart well obviously things have changed a lot we've got presidents who if they're not making a public appeal every day we think there's something wrong with them\nDo you think that this change in the nature of presidential leadership towards routine public appeals um the idea that presidents have to go over the heads of ... other lawmakers\nHas that contributed to the retreat misunderstanding of the conservative tradition in America\nMay have a I Want to add one point to what Larry said about that example uh it's not only that Lincoln said on multiple occasions I Can't talk about the most important issue of the time\nAnd gave reasons why he couldn't talk about it\nBut the audience cheered him for telling them why he couldn't talk about what he wasn't going to talk about he actually got applause for that and so we I use that in the book because can you imagine now a president's saying I Can't talk to you and being a applauded for it [noise] um [noise]\nUh I'm trying to think of a a thoughtful answer to your question\nLet me say that there's been a a a really recent changed uh since I wrote the book and so the book came out again because the Trump so just last year so there's a long afterward about this um and Trump makes us a certain kind of breaking in and here's why\nIt's not in the nineteenth century presidents routinely did not go to the people they went to the Congress directly in the twentieth century presidents routinely go to us and it's been coming\nTrying to do my part and that's why we're asking you to do just your part in support this new surface it's

there Greg\nHi Mary Louise how bad is it [noise] [noise] well\nIt's what you would expect you know it was a category for storm nearly a category five which came ashore right here yeah I passed right over this this area and Mexico beach which is a very small community you know the storm surge came in and you can see signs of every of every where there's still lots of standing water here most of the water went out but there's still plenty of it around\nBut it was those wins in a hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds just tore our hearts many buildings here lifted up entire buildings through them down and other ones you saw roofs off you know siding off sides off um luckily though most people who had left and weren't here to seal\nAnd are you able to drive around them into the streets relative it clear of water\nYet to hear that it's a very small community and to do the streets themselves are not too bad getting here is another matter you know we came over from Tallahassee today it should be a couple of hours my producer Becky Sullivan and I took us nine hours to get here because you just don't know what roads are open and the roads are open they're just barely open you have to drive around this round down trees\nYour power crews out and in in ... and good Samaritans doing what they can but it's still very hard slog to get in or out of this area\nAnd when you say it took him nine hours that's a drive that would normally take you how long\nBut what about the impact on people I mean there's always with the storms some people stayed they rode out the storm I assume you've been out talking to them what are they saying\nYeah I mean it's a it's a tough one I talked to a man here who stayed and he said he left in hurricane ... which was in Nineteen Ninety five and you always regretted it was so hard to get back into the community later he always where he'd states we stayed\nAnd he said the storm was like anything he was prepared for it or at ever experienced before you know the the sound the noise the the windows the walls flexing and he had a little safer and built for himself and his pets at one point he said it became so he's something told him that this was no longer safe\nAnd they moved to an inter a bathroom and that happened the windows shattered glass blasted and he said they certainly would have been injured if they had been the case\nAnd he kind of struggled to patch of his window and rode out the rest of the storm and uh today's here repairing his house with a neighbor and I asked him if he was started that he stayed he says no he'd do it again because he says if I didn't stay there all my mature all my possessions everything we get ruined by the rain and the other stuff coming in\nAnd what about the people who did evacuate is there any kind of timeframe on when they might be able to come home [noise]\nUh no I don't I'm not not yet as far as I Know when you arrive engulf a county here you get an alert on your cell phone

all of a sudden it just disappeared so we just assumed it was stolen okay whatever [noise]\nSo after the storm he comes running back up and he says the ... back and I'm like no way to go back and make sure it's our canoe and he said yep it's our canoe and I said just won't pull it back up on the grass where it used to be and then we started laughing about it because it's just a silly story we don't know\nI mean we can get into you know alien abductions are the canoe et cetera et cetera but um\nYou know the lake is delivered items in the past I mean we've seen the Socrates here I think it was a

get much worse\nThat's the gist of this week's new inter governmental panel on climate change report a dramatic forty five percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by twenty thirty will be needed to stave off major climate impacts\nIs it possible and if not worse climate system look like in twelve years John Abraham is a professor of thermal sciences at the University of St Thomas in St\nI hate to say realistically we will not make the cuts necessary to reach forty five percent but that could change I mean just a few years ago the United states was an international leader and\nThe worst very quickly things can change for the better very quickly as well and one of the most appealing things for motivating change is economics\nYou are now able here in Minnesota to get electrons and electricity in energy from clean sources that are cost effective way of fossil fuels\nCertainly we can make these changes it's uncertain to me whether we will but the economics are pointing in the right direction\nAnd the technology is already there in many cases we know you mention the potential for getting our electricity from renewable sources I Am a one hundred percent wind customer and that's simply a phone call or going on line to make that happen what other things can Minnesotans listening to us right now due to make a meaningful difference\nI'm like you I get all of my power by wind energy except Paul recently just two weeks ago I installed solar panels on my house so my entire house\nIs power by sunlight and the access to energy that we generate is sold back to the grid so

plant based uh nutrition you'll produce less emission so\nWhat you eat what you drive how you power your homes in vehicles and also how you vote I think it's important for people to vote for
