along with Neal Conan is co host of the democracy tests series\nWell she came to St Paul earlier this month to speak at the Minnesota historical societies history forum about her most recent area of expertise in her newest book titled to make men free a history of the Republican Party years had er Cox Richardson\nA pleasure to be here it's a funny time to be talking about the history of the Republican Party but even for people who are not Republicans this material holds important ideas I think because in many ways the history of the Republican Party I think\nIt's a history of America so let me walk you through a whirlwind tour of American history and the next hour that focuses on the principles of the Republican Party and within that the principles\nSet up is the idea that what is at the heart of the Republican Party has a contradiction that is also with the heart of American society and it's buried in our two founding documents the declaration of independence and the constitution\nAnd well younger people often tend to lump those two things together they're very very different documents the declaration of independence of courses from Seventeen Seventy six and it's a document that the founders wrote to the other nations of the world to explain why it was imperative for them\nTo essentially become traders and this is a document that lays out the concept that every man and we're only really going to be talking about men for a while here and certainly not people of color on that every man a was created equal\nThat every man had a right to self government and to equality of opportunity and it's a principle that is a rousing principal and a good way to get people behind you to fight a war which of course they're going to be doing but by the time of\nTrying to establish a new nation\nAfter the articles of confederation they are looking at a very different set of problems and they need just cement people behind a body of laws and in that body of laws outlined in the constitution the primary idea is the protection of property\nAnd those two ideas equality of opportunity inequality before the law and breadth the protection of property often butt heads against each other in American history\nAnd it shows up nowhere so powerfully as in the Republican Party\nSo walk you through this a little bit the early years first of all Americans believe that there was not a contradiction between these two concepts out of equality and that of property because they had this extraordinary land out to the west if you remember ...\nSupport comes

through slave labor\nAny slave in those territories is property so by definition under the Dred Scott decision all of those territories are going to become slave territory\nAnd once they get broken up into states and of course at the time it looked like there is going to be a lot of western states because who knew we were going to make such giant states out there\nThe free states are going to be completely over awed by the slave states both in the house of representatives and in the Senate and it's only a question of time into slavery becomes national [noise]\nThat's what we're talking about and we're talking about the rise of the Republican Party is this feeling of\nThat's it we're going to become an oligarchy of this fabulously of these fabulously wealthy man who are going to make the rules for everybody else and once that happens do you think there's any chance they're going to give us equality of opportunity\nIn Eighteen fifty eight in the Senate James Henry Hammond answered that question with a speech that's come down through history as the hot news kings beach but it ought to be the ... speech called the months you'll speech because\nSupport for NPR's brought you by the law

before concrete\nI'm ... that are driven into the ground deeply enough that they hit 'em a dry bed so that you can build a house on top of it\nSo they are literally driven into the mud to support what's above them\nAnd he says she'll get ... they're not very smart they don't care they just want physical pleasures they need to be directed by their batters in order to move society forward because what that does is those people at the bottom produce a lot\nAnd they um they ... if you if you let them actually have any of it they're going to waste it in like food and drink and you know housing 'em but [noise] if you let it accumulates if you let the people above you know people like me I'm accumulate\nWe use it for stuff like fine art and education and to direct the economy in such a way that it brings benefits for everybody and we take care of those people at the bottom and they're loyal to us and the problem he says is that\nFirst of all you northerners make the mistake of believing that crap about everybody being equal because everybody's not equal some of us really are better than others and the problem in the north you like those people vote and if you let them vote they're going to want more of what they produce\nThey're not going to be able to do this society is going to stagnate\nBecause you're not going to be able to get those concentration of wealth and an education of connections and the the networks around the world that are going to enable us to move society forward you are literally going to destroy society if you let these mud sills participate in their government\n[noise] that's the exact same argument that Alexander Stevens is going to make in a corner has very famous cornerstone speech in which he says\nThe confederacy is the wave of the future we have refined that crazy idea that men are created equal they're not we're better than other people and we are sacrificing ourselves to create this new forward looking society\nThat's an ideology that's a mindset and that's where people like James Henry hamon were in the Eighteen fifties and James Henry Hammond is a fascinating character\nGoing to give you a little bit on him um because his mindset I think is illustrated in part by his behavior\nHe was famous for bullying he was famous for his outbursts and his temper um and he was also infamous for raping not only his slaves um he kept to a a slave woman and her daughter\nAnd then later said to his son um please keep the slaves in the family I Can't free them because it would just make them miserable I'm but let's make sure that only our family owns my children [noise]\nUm but he also rape just four nieces who were the daughters of weighed Hampton which if you know you're southern history like a lot I can think of the equivalent um he was the wealthiest man in the south and in his diary because he recorded all the um\nGym through him and blamed the girls um for for coming on to ...\nWhich took a about twelve years they wouldn't let him back end of the Senate um because but then they did so um but that personality I think is is the last ...\nSo too did Abraham Lincoln think it was the last ... in Eighteen fifty nine in Milwaukee, Wisconsin he responds directly to James Henry Hammond\nAnd this speech really matters because in it he takes on that ... says there's some people out here I think that some people are better than others and the way you move society for is to accumulate wealth of the top and keep everybody else down\nAnd remember Abraham Lincoln was one of those ... cells when his family moved to Indiana\nThey literally could not afford a fourth wall on their house that's where they kept the fire but they were playing by squirrels in life and all the things like that and he worked as a day laborer and he was actually quite well known as a fighter I mean he was a physical fighter those long arms help\nAnd um and he was one of those ... cells that James Henry Hammond who is raping his nieces\nSays is not good enough to make decisions about his own future\nAnd Abraham Lincoln looks at this and he says no that's one way to look at the world but but we disagree with that people think like me say that the the people at the bottom the hard workers are the ones we're all the new ideas are and all the production is and all the the the exciting stuff is happening and if you empower\nIf you give them access to opportunity the world's going to move forward a lot faster than if you cloistered all up with these rich guys who simply use their money to ... paintings on the walls and to feed their own\nAppetites and this idea this idea that free labor is the heart of America it that that it produces more than anybody could possibly can\nAbove them and they in turn employ a few finance fears and industrialists who will in turn it start people at the bottom is going to create this\nCycle of prosperity that it's uniquely American because of how many um how much have how many resources the ... the American west especially if it's that America has and it's going to create a cycle of prosperity that will continue until every bag or in the country is equipped with a coach and four\nAnd this is true genius of America\nBut it depends on the guys at the bottom having a say\nIn the way they're governed well\nYou know how this plays out an Eighteen sixty the Republicans who now have found a champion and found a language for what they believe in not just what they stand against they run Abraham Lincoln for the White House and when he wins an Eighteen sixty southerners a southern leaders by the way\nNot regular southerners who at this point or not supporting the the leadership which itself is an interesting story that I really don't have time to tell you about\nBut southern leaders declare that the south is going to preserve its system of oligarchy nickel slavery by creating a\nNew nation and by destroying the old United States of America [noise] well\nThis is the this new party and a bizarre position they've got this leader who's a bump can is the first ... first one that tries to take advantage of his height and to emphasize that he's something different as opposed to the ones that tried to hide how different he was ready to put them in a ... it was too small so you could see how big his hands were for example\nUm which and be and yet the rest of them on a book um there's a lot going on in his portrait but you've got this back would bump Ken\nIn the presidency at the head of a party\nNo idea what it's doing so it's always hold them a lot of of people from other parties but they don't really know what they believe in\nIt's worth going to take over a million men it's going to create in the army in the navy is going to raise more than six billion ... billion ... billion dollars and these are all things that are unsinkable an Eighteen sixty one\n[noise] but for our purposes today the other thing was the Republican Party does is it puts teeth into the idea that the government really should create equality of opportunity for people at the bottom\nAnd the Republicans very deliberately continued construction on the Capitol building despite the fact they were terribly short of money during the war because they recognize that people were looking at them to create a new nation\nAnd then if you stopped creating that that building it was a sign about what was happening to the nation so they do a number of things first of all they passed the homestead act which puts regular Americans on land simply for their willingness to live on it and work on it they also passed the department of agriculture\nGrant and they he and his friend Carl shirts down hair color shirts who's from Missouri and um spend time in Wisconsin they are looking for some way to a ... to attack the very popular grant\nAnd they buy into this idea that the Republicans are using the government that is protecting African Americans only to get themselves reelected\nThey really popularized this idea of corruption that this is somehow looking quite a bit like what happened in the Paris Commune these people are redistributing wealth they are\nConscious [noise]\nIf you search the New York times making Seventy one word socialist communist are everywhere it is not a twentieth century phenomenon in America so not modern day communism marks is writing now but he hasn't taken on any where this is way pre Lenin and all that but\nWrote a letter to Lincoln when he won and sixty four but um but they pick up that language to attack grants now Carl shirts had a protege who clearly admired shirts Joseph Pulitzer uh the\nProtege of Carl shirts this goes into the American newspaper system\nUm throughout the rest of the century meanwhile grant has to do something about the fact he's got this revolt in his own party and SHE Teams up with the handsome man in the nineteenth century as he has no [noise] Roscoe constantly runs New York\nIn order to win New York\nYou have to win New York city against that tweed ring and you have to win New York to win the presidency because New York has thirty five electoral votes compared to anybody else in the country\nAh Pennsylvania is the next closest with twenty nine most states have very very few so the Republican Party jumps on board this anti African American anti immigrant train in order to\nRetain the support of Wall Street\nAnd the party quite deliberately switches from being the party of Lincoln to adopting this language of anti uh anti at this racial and as you know phobic language anti labor language to becoming the party\nOf big business Jay Rockefeller\nPlaying with the U.S Congress and um and having an and owning the White House and this is the Arab by the Eighteen eighties where Congress belongs to the rich guys just as the era when literally senators called themselves the senator for the sugar trust or the senator for the juice trust\nAnd they believe that this is the way it was supposed to be by the Eighteen eighties you get the Republican Party time itself to this concept that originally had been\nAdvanced by people like James Henry ham and the idea that um\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

R. go dot com\nA hundred thousand votes but that's put into office by a trick and the electoral college [noise]\nUm people forget that Eighteen Ninety two before the homestead strike very deliberately stage to say is this really a quality is this man here in the bowler hats really equals Andrew Carnegie\nAnd this obviously is designed to say no and of course on the heels of this we get the panic of Eighteen Ninety three and a great financial disaster\n[noise] so what I'm sitting up here at great length and I'm going to go much quicker here or to get you through the rest of the century is this pattern of the governor the Republican Party being designed to protect equality of opportunity\nThen tripping over the problem of the fact that that cost tax dollars\nSo that idea weakens under an onslaught of racism and xenophobia and later sexism and the party type self to big business and it creates an economic crash so me and walk you through that\nTeddy Roosevelt and Bob ... for example take a look at fighting Bob La Follette from Wisconsin take a look at what's happening around them in the Eighteen eighties in the Eighteen nineties and say this is not American democracy this is not what Lincoln stood for and Teddy Roosevelt of course both of them are huge fans of Lincoln\nAnd they begin to argue that in fact the idea of the ... the government once again should protect equality of opportunity\nAnd they changed the idea of liberalism from the idea that a liberal government comes from the idea of John Locke that the government must be kept small in order to keep it from a pressing the individual they begin to argue that in fact the opposite is true that the government must regulate\nTo create equality of opportunity for everybody and it's during the early years of Teddy Roosevelt presidency that the concept of liberalism goes from small government to big government both with the idea of protecting individual isn't\nThere fighting up hill they produce the progressive era which gives us some of our early legislation but of course you have the rise of anti immigrant I'm great anti immigrant sentiment an anti African American sentiment and yet the KKK in the Nineteen twenties was focused largely on the immigrant population\nBecause the African American population is already on the ropes the popularity of the clan in Nineteen twenty five meanwhile businessmen in sick in this period\nThat the country's communist and it's one of my favorite quotes in American history this is um the guy who gets involved in a teapot dome in which he says a majority of the college professors in the United states are teaching socialism and bullshit isn't\nA Thompson is teaching bullshit businessmen he may get convert Lamont of J. P. Morgan and company vendor looked as a ... he's a banker so is Charles are crane who went on to become a fascist so the bar for being a socialist here he's really really really long [noise]\nAnd when Woodrow Wilson goes abroad with Woodrow Wilson mind you\nI'm not one one wouldn't necessarily call an ardent progressive certainly on ... cases of race or when he took historians to Europe with him\nHe said this was a sign that America had joined communism so under the Republicans are the Nineteen twenties once again the party become the party of big business and it destroys the the tax legislation of the progressive era and World War one destroys the progressive legislation\nAnd ... and ... under Andrew Mellon um weekends\nTo um to businessmen and populate the government with business as opposed to with the regulators who are supposed to be overseeing business and he says the government for now is going to help business rather than trying to regulate it\nAnd of course we very famously have Calvin Coolidge saying the business of America is business which he never said\nUm if it's something like that but that's apocryphal and finally we get Herbert Hoover who is elected by a landslide in Nineteen twenty eight who says that the government must stay out of the economy\nBecause the idea of regulating and providing equality of opportunity for people at the bottom was the same philosophy of government which has poisoned all of Europe\nThe few ... of the witches cauldron\nWhich boiled in Russia or the party of the mob\nThank God we still have a government in Washington which knows how to deal\nWith them all [noise]\nWe know what happened October of Nineteen twenty nine we get the great crash and we get the depression and we get the rise of ... of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who recreate a version of a Lincoln's vision of the government protecting equality of opportunity and providing a base he as a basic social safety net to that and that's the new deal\nThat's the new deal state what became called the liberal consensus that goes into the post war years it is designed to create a world in which everybody gets equality of opportunity and a very famous image from Nineteen forty nine\nFrom this remember boys and girls your school like our country is made up of Americans of many different races religions and national origins so if you hear anybody talk against a schoolmate or anyone else because of his religion race or national origin\nThat kind of talk is on American\nDwight Eisenhower of course believes in there's liberal state the liberal\nLike the FDR has gone after business quite as much as he has and he creates its own new vision of this called the middle way\nAnd he takes the Republican Party into a version of the new deal state that promotes equality of opportunity and yet pulls back a little bit on the regulations that FDR has put in place over business it's worth remembering that Eisenhower\nA oversaw the largest infrastructure system in American history and also he refused to lower the war taxes that had the upper income\nTax bracket in America at Ninety One percent because he said I can how are\nBelieved this isn't

St\nBy the religious right and in that you can kind of see the power that these accusations can can wield\nAnd you can imagine there why Pakistan's Supreme Court would have taken its time before announcing this ruling freeing the woman what was the scene like as they finally did make the ruling\nRight so we were in the court house at the time and it was very very tests which is unusual for the Supreme Court here the judges walked in all three of them they sat down and within a minute they denounce they've addict she'd been acquitted she was free to go we rushed out and as we rushed out we could actually see security forces\nI'm rushing into the direction of the Supreme Court just shut down the area so demonstrate as couldn't reach that they've been on high alert since yesterday because they were worried about violence and on even on the roads to the Supreme Court we could see these big containers\nBlock roads so we raised actually twin intersection that's a few miles from the Supreme Court we we knew that the demonstrators from the extreme religious right and um they were chanting that against us your baby all ready you can have a listen here\n[laughter] [noise]\nThey're saying we hear in a ... a profit of Islam but this wasn't about that what they were saying when we were speaking to them now saying I said it was because she deserves to die and they were even saying the judges who ruled out to a ... a CBP deserve to be killed because the judgment with against Islam\nBeer when you say the judges came in very quickly gave the ruling and left I I mean I have this image of Supreme Court justices knowing they have to flee pretty quickly after that is there a serious fear of more more assassinations more violence\nAbsolutely um and that's why the country is on high alert even ask the baby and her family as far as we understand 'em they may well now be evacuated from the country it's just not safe for them anymore but the question is now what about the Christian communities that remain\nHow much can these security forces Cape older and a country where bless me is such a powerful issue\nThe effects for the reporting really appreciate it thank you and bears do you do is Islam of odd Pakistan where the country's Supreme Court has free to a woman who had been accused and convicted and sentenced to death for blasphemy\nSupport comes from sales force sales force essential is a C.

make it easier for citizens to do business and help them to trust each other more\nIt's similar to the American credit score but much more sweeping attracts far more than financial transactions and it's called the social credit score Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast explain\nTo people in China don't have bank accounts don't really have much of a credit history so China has never created something quick\nIs the lack of a better way to trust deficit in China that is impacting economic activity\nRachel ... teaches trust and technology and is the author of who can you trust she says a lack of trust in people and businesses have held China's economy back\nSo in China decided to make a centralized score the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them\nAnd you know who has lots of data on how people behave\nCompanies especially big companies like Ali Baba that is China's version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country and has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit so the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit score\nThe way people that school is not somebody when they miss a bill it could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public they gave the press was you know if you buy not ease your responsible so your school go up but if you buying video games you lazy CEO school go down\nBut it's a credit score will not be all about what you by the government is also collecting data of its own and that data will factor into people's social credit scores to\nThe social credit system is not scheduled to be rolled out nationally until twenty twenty but we got a

shows the nation is deeply divided on the issue of sexual assault and harassment most of the thousands of Americans surveyed the thousand Americans surveyed see progress in holding offenders accountable but more than ...\nStill the movement has gone too far NPR's Tovia Smith has been looking into this pull and joins us now Hi Tovia the mornings so not so surprising that the nation is divided on this as it is on so many things but what is really interesting here is where that divide falls right\nRight for all the talk about this as a woman's issue in our war on men it turns out gender is actually less a driver here than party is so for example we asked whether the benefit of the doubt in these cases should go to alleged victims eighty five percent of Democrats say yes compared to sixty seven percent of Republicans and\nThat party divide is nearly twice the size of the gender gap and we see a similar pattern on sexual harassment that gap is actually widened in the past year mostly because of shifting opinions among Republicans and you can get a sense of that here from one of the respondents fifty three year old Cindy Bradshaw from Texas\nA site in the last year that girls are like oh yeah me too but I find some of the girls want the attention and I felt like it really really takes away from the girls that you know it really happened\nTo so she clearly sounds like someone who thinks me too movement as a whole has gone too far or did the pull off that specific question and and what did it find [noise] yes\nVery stark divide overall forty three percent thanked me too has gone too far I'm and from what respondents have told me that tends to mean there's too much rushing to judgment and too many maybe frivolous accusations so the partisan divide on that it's three quarters of Republicans and less than one quarter of Democrats\nAnd same story on related questions like whether people think false accusations of sexual assault are common um the party split there is quadruple the gender gap so we see lots of democratic\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoors through October and indoor

voters shocked the world the former pro wrestler turn mayor turn talk show host was elected the thirtieth governor of the state of Minnesota\nThose years today covering Jesse Ventura it was more than a fulltime job keeping up with the governor required a thick high dose dirty pair of shoes and a fully charge Nokia or blackberry in those days like our current president Ventura had a contentious relationship with the press\nEspecially Minnesota's political reporters\nWe've got a name for the media equivalent to the public understand like a sports team may do jackals go right some BS jak holes right some BS\nTwo of those media jackals are here with me now is our own Carrie Miller who covered the governor for care eleven back in the day hey are high and Tom Hauser then and now it's ... channel five and author of the book inside the ropes with Jesse Ventura Tom welcome absolutely still selling like hockey\n[laughter] I have a new life it will really twentieth anniversary of the Amazon number one out of every\nAll right I'm going to start with Tom when I say Jesse Ventura what comes to your mind right away\nUmbrage he took umbrage at almost everything we recorded even when it was positive he would find a negative in what we were reporting because he couldn't get over the fact that we were\nJackass [laughter] ... yeah um I don't understand why I was gonna say grievance and here's the thing a grievance that had I think\nA certain kind of self deprecating into it and humor to it so I Know sometimes he was in on the joke and that is what made him in Deering and infuriating\nWork you do as a political reporter is holding the governor accountable representing the voters with your questions are doing that work Mitch what became a media circus especially nationally what were the\nDay in and day out well it was very difficult because he would often change the narrative and changed the story five times in one day and you're right it is I Know you just read the book time I had written about this one day and I think it was may have Ninety nine\nWhen he started his day talking about how to bring the legislature together and how you know Republicans Democrats and reform party governor can work together later in the day he announces that his wife Terry\nMight retire as first lady and then like an hour later years go on sale at the mall of America\nAnd pretty soon ... story that he wanted to be the ... the story of the day about actual legislative stuff\nWas like barely a reader or by the anchors near the end of the top blocking you remember\nHow this drove the legislators crazy he drove the narrative he drove the political narrative\nAnd we just kind of hung on and we had to cover\nThe five different you know topics a day or whatever was going on with him and he was out of the mold and there was no real standard for the way to cover somebody like this which is something I think\nThe reporters the White House press corps is dealing with right now how do you cover this it's uncharted territory and you in some ways make it up as you\nAnd the lawmakers eventually realized they had to find a way to kind of curry favor with the governor right so that they could get him on their side of an issue as they knew\nThe only one that was going to get reported on in any significant way was the governor is it possible to detach that big personality and the men who like you said throughout three things that day\nAnd look at the policies of what he was able to do as governor well on a data\nSense of anything because it was so haphazard and it would evolve and change every day he\nDid something that that most governors will not end he truly delegated power in a way that many politicians don't want to do he gave them the opportunity to craft policy and there there were times on big ideas where it went this\nWay to the top not top down and lie down on a march and and I thought that was something unique in the early years of of the administration\nI understand the Jesse Ventura himself does not like the comparison to Donald Trump\nBecause uh he sees Donald Trump as the nominee of one of the major parties and that wasn't him but in terms of style media bashing UC parallels today to Donald Trump and the way he treats the media\nI Do but there was never an underlying malevolent to Jesse Ventura I think President Trump feels a true malevolent at times even though he needs the media and he loves the media and he seeks the media\nThere was also a darker an Adam is yeah that I don't I think Jesse Ventura became annoyed by the media but I never felt that it was really deeply mean and personal", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Rochester", "day": "31"}
