where it where it came from because when he retired and one boy did that wonderful story he was Seventy two and he was still jumping up on tables and diving under a desk and running back and forth from the news labs to the studio and to his office\nNow we we have to explain to folks about the jumping up on the desks because when I was a student at the river falls we heard about these antics even over a River Falls a about this professor jumping up on desks and he would Korean around the room during his lectures what was that about it was the first\nClass I ever ... took from Henry and I think was journalism one thirty five or the the basic news reporting and he wanted to explain what different angles of photography would mean and so he would jump up on a desk to show you you know this is a high angle\nAnd he would then dive down on the floor and say this is a low angle and don't worry about the parade they'll they'll move around you you know like you're going to go right in the middle of a parade and dive in the middle of them but he just wanted to explain that you had to be in it you know what I mean it just\nIt was something that really made me love\nJournalism and love him\nIt was infectious his enthusiasm and what he was doing his students seem to matter to him that all of you over all these years are almost like some of the word family would that be accurate\nThat are coming out are amazing and how he helped people through the years right recommendations for adoptions went to weddings spoke at weddings he you know I work\nIn a clear where where he uh you know lived and and I would always run into Henry at different things he's still went to city council meetings and a school board meetings just to make sure that watchdog was there in the front row keeping track of what was going on\nAnd the family atmosphere was definitely there with Henry he wanted to know what you were doing he wanted to keep track of you and he had so many students I think that had been a big task different favorite memory [noise] there's so many but I'm totally remember the time I was in a class not his\nAnd all of a sudden Henry H all appeared in the window of the class and I thought oh no now what you know he's now getting me out of class to cover a story you know [laughter]\nAnd uh he knocked\nOn the door and the professor opened it and there was Henry just wave at me you know ... motions me over and\nI'm like yeah and he's like oh there's ... there's a there's an opening an internship at Waxman we radio and uh you must apply and I'm like right\nNow [laughter] he said oh we must\nCan't wait on these things you just had to let me know right then what was happening and then I had to apply for that and I did and I got it and that basically started\nThe whole process of me being here for twenty nine years so\nThat's my favorite memory though just to see them in the window of that classroom appearing in the window the classroom is W E a

busy and I can only imagine how busy this down there in Iowa\nWe share that feeling in fact we have compiled a list of all the politicians in surrogates who has visited this lovely state in October

unlike the third congressional in Minnesota it's got some suburban some urban and there's actually a lot more rural\nWe've seen more than six million dollars to the outside spending the candidates themselves has been spending a lot of money it's confident on television because this is really one of the races as Mike Pence said when he visited a few months ago this is one of the races that will determine whether or not the Republicans hold the U.S house\nWith a recent poll showed between a David Young and said he asks me\nThat ... what we expected it is super\nClose yeah the New York times with their lives polling has actually pulled it twice and it's been within a point there to both times you know it really is a swing district that is getting all this attention and you know we'll have to see on election day which way voters sway one of the things that's\nDifferent in Minnesota and Iowa is that we actually do have registration by party here and last I checked there were maybe twenty voters difference between Democrats and Republicans\nSuper ... say well you're\nTalking about voters a ditch and I would just change of voter id law\n[noise] that's right so it's sort of have a soft launch here in Iowa which means even if you don't have id this year you'll still be able to vote you will be asked for id so it's sort of getting people used to the idea and there are certainly a lot of fights about uh just like you saw in Minnesota a few years ago I\nI also thought do in the correct me please or does this new law outlaw straight ticket voting\nThat's right so what used to be basically you could check a box and you run to all up and down the party line and now you can't just do a one vote and you're out\nWell of course uh I might have very lead on this one but you have obviously a tight governor's race down there as they have in Wisconsin so tell me a little bit about Kim rentals and front Hubble\nThat's right so Kim Reynolds actually is the first female governor of Iowa but she hasn't run on her own she was lieutenant governor Terry Branstad became the ambassador to China she was elevated\nTo that position so she's running on her own this time um she's actually running saying look things in Iowa are pretty good you know her little campaign slogan is keep Iowa moving\nK. I. M. like Kim Reynolds\nAnd Fred Hubble has a very different attitude he says look Iowa is not doing as well as it should we are under funding education we're under funding healthcare were underfunding mental health\nAnd want to be really interesting I was specific issues is a few years ago I Would move towards privatizing Medicaid and you know there have been some problems with that and they\nSaid Hubble has really been campaigning against it and it's something that was done through executive order so he says look I if I become governor on day one I Will issue an executive order to try to unravel that and take back some state\nControl of health care for the poor the disabled the elderly and the ...\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

certain places like two in cities or the ... town here you know there are pioneering the bundled price\nWere they can tell you that your knee surgery is going to cost us much even though there's a salary to head to head right there was a thousand pieces involved\nThe consumer or whoever's paying know how much you're going to pay but there's not many people are tunes these are the Putin term you know are companies like that so they have a thousand things that go into surgery like a like a screw [laughter] you know they don't know if this hundred dollars to do as divided as well or they can't tell you how much is going to cost you have to go into a blind\nSabrina this is what's so inferiority infuriating about this is that we as consumers are ... more of this is coming back on us find out about what your health care you know be aware of this kind of thing of how much health and then it's impossible to get a straight answer on a surgery why\n[laughter] yeah that's right and we haven't even talked about what happens when you go to a hospital that's in your insurance companies network but you have a service that's delivered by a doctor or you have a test that's done that is out of network on your head with the full bill it's called surprise balance billing\nI'm and I'm ... and there and you're you know you\nDon't even have a deductible apply it's a hundred percent you're out of pocket obligation and you may not even you may have done all your due diligence to find out that you're going to win in network hospital I'm only to find out that the anesthesiologist or something I'm isn't covered so you know the\nThe bottom line is that um there are a lot of providers in the system I'm for him the patient is you know it's\nTheir their revenue source [laughter] um but I think we're getting to a tipping point where patients and consumers have had enough um and it's just a question of what do we do about it\nA joy says on Twitter or deductible is six thousand dollars so we go to a private clinic for anything that falls outside of coverage checkups they don't take insurance and they offer great would affordable ... medical care thirty nine dollars\nTo the phones you to Chris in ... Hi Chris what do you want to tie the discussion here\nWell you've touched on it a little bit um I've been waiting but I'm the big thing that I don't hear anybody talking about is the the for profits aspect of our health care and you know insurance CEOs are making in the hundreds of millions of dollars between salaries and bonuses\nUm and the other thing you have just been talking about too is the you know we're told will shop around find the best right and yeah and yet most of our insurance companies will only let us go to one place\nFor your toys yes so your choices are limited on that let let's talk about the for profit uh aspect of this I mean it Sabrina when we had Minnesota you know it was a leader in creating these non profit health HMOs right health providers\nAnd still I mean health care costs even during that period were going up and became on\nA on a portable for a lot of a health care consumers ... is is that a key part of this where would you put that in this discussion\nWell I you know um I yeah I Do think the profit motive and health care has has really gotten um\nExtreme I Will say however when you look at a for profit versus non profit insurance companies are for profit versus nonprofit um\nHealth systems um you know it's not so much about their that status as how much um clout do they have in the market right you can have a non profit hospital system a that if they're you know the\nBig gorilla in the market they will set their prices really really high um just because they can and um [noise] uh it doesn't matter necessarily that they are\nIt's a company is to um you look at some of the surplus is that these non quote unquote nonprofit insurance companies have and they're in the billions of dollars they're just sitting on these big start by says so I'm ... you know I don't know that it's for profit versus nonprofit that's um\nThe the root of the problem but you know there's there's there's definitely a lot of profit seeking in in the ads\nAre not that the CEOs aren't making a lot of money but it's but what do you want to say\nTops yeah not that they don't deserve it you know they're doing their job you know but just for example the NFL is a non profit you know but it has a monopoly on football you know so the players the owners the coaches get paid millions of dollars\nYou know so but most of us don't think of the NFL's and I I didn't even know that yeah I mean the vision itself so I mean\nIt's really brought this monopoly and all the guy probably kind of behavior that allows an insurance company and the hospital systems to make a lot of money and pay people a lot you know but they're doing their job their job is to make money and then they get paid accordingly\nKimberly says on Twitter or think about it every time the deductible just got a bill for a Velcro hand splint for a kid that came out of a white cardboard box from China\nIn the doctor's office eight hundred and fifty dollars [noise] that is out on the line now that description as crazy to Brian in Minneapolis hey Brian thanks so much for waiting um where do you come to this discussion from\nThanks for having me oh I'm a resident physician you're in Minneapolis and I've been doing a personal investigation on cost transparency specifically good for medications for patients yeah I worked in I'm Sorry I'm In a primary care clinic us and\nYou know one of our biggest problems is medication compliance\nAnd a lot of times it is I find out it is it issues with costs\n... from a provider standpoint it's very uh we were really in the dark we replace in order it goes to a pharmacy than the patient goes to the pharmacy and whether they have called payment or whether they may have to meet their doctor ball or whether they're in the Medicare and they're in the doughnut hole um they've got to kind of figure that out on their own\nAnd a lotta times patients will not end up picking up the medication\nBecause of cost my mom we see the downstream of facts right off of them coming into the hospital where\nIf you if you if you're a diabetic and you need some medications your not your never hearing\nBrian or rarely hearing well I just couldn't take that pill because it was going to cost a hundred and fifty dollars a month and I don't have that then you see the consequences of not having had the medication used is that is that

Maine and there's always been something I think of a tension between a kind of highbrow insulted rhetoric off and backed up by\nSophisticated statistics\nAnd claims rooted in science and a advanced learning of various kinds and more folksy style that sort of says I Know things when I see them like the kind of a kitchen table logic that says you know there is no global warming because I went outside today and it was warmer than it was this time last year and\nAnd political life and at times I think Trump\nHits that court in an ordinary sort of way using plain language folksy analogies kind of appealing to an every man style but then there are other moments when that isn't quite the idiom that he draws a palm and I think that moment you mentioned about the question about\nThe inaugural crowd says an odd one because to lie about something in which the evidence is so this is a bleak clearly in front of everybody is to suggest not ally as a cover up but a lie is a kind of\nPolitical strategy of sorts onto itself and what is that strategy\nAnd I think that strategy is to say in some ways the facts don't matter that\nSure sometimes on line sometimes on telling the truth sometimes on making it up\nBut I'm not going to follow conventional norms in might speech patterns and authority is essentially going to reside would in me\nIt's not going to be a matter of all of us agreeing on some common premise so in a sense he's trying to demolish established authority and replace authority with himself is that what you're saying I think that's a good part of it I mean one of the interesting things about American\nAnd one of them is half empty and that couldn't be the biggest crowd in history and that might seem like it doesn't work into convince anybody in the moment but it's essential that as many people as possible keep doing that\nKeep relentlessly reminding us of the sort of basic facts as a pushback against a world in which it's very hard to tell what what\nIt's impossible to miss how often Trump puts his most outlandish lies in the mouths of others he says you know a lot of people or\nSupport for NPR's brought you by the law firm of ... intellectual property group with offices in Minnesota in Los Angeles Inskeep ... group aims to help companies leverage the power of patents to protect their innovation you can find out more at ... dot com\nEverything's up for grabs some people are saying that some other people are saying that\nUh he sometimes says I've been hearing you know but without saying from home or with what evidence so it seems to me a whole bunch of rhetorical strategy that'll work in the same way which is to say I don't have facts and figures I don't need facts and figures and if I had them they'd be distorted any way you can't really trust\nIn the FBI the center for Disease Control New York times whatever it is I go by instinct to and I go by what I'm hearing on the street so to speak but the danger there is that nobody knows anything about anything then\nOther politicians can't help but notice that you appear to be able to campaign fact\nFree and still be elected president these days do you think that's going to be part of the Trump legacy\nYeah that's that's of course the great worry because Trump didn't create the phenomenon of Trump it onto himself he didn't ... you know drop out of the sky and you won't be around forever either the question is will this\nStyle of politics remain and if it does what does it mean for democracy and going forward I think she at the moment\nOver the world we're seeing that this was a pretty effective technique that in the age of um [noise] the Internet particularly it's very easy to spread on truth in such a way that it's not even clear what the truth and what's in the truth any more populist style at least has\nOver in many corners of the world with quite different political traditions so whether this is going to turn out to be a sort of a blip in American history that's certainly possible in the U.S has weathered many crises in the past\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

Bush years and ah in some areas in the others not and certainly um\nThe Republican Party hasn't been transformed overnight\nBut yet there is something different and\nI think it explains some of the kind of hysteria in opposition and I think it explains the very fact that every newspaper in the country is now sort of putting on the front page of chronicle of lives of the President's Day after day something that's really hard to imagine in a previous moment in quite the same form\nSomething has really shifted beneath us and yeah that might make that might make Trump despite himself in some ways a transformational president\nIs he not simply appealing to the anti intellectual strain that has a long history in this country\nThat whole idea of why should you listen to experts why should you listen to egg heads just use your common sense that seems to be something that's been a strain in GOP history since at least Ronald Reagan\nA certain amount of continuity and uh I think in the long history of democratic public life in the U.S most evident but it's true elsewhere to has been a kind of conflict from the beginning between a growing\nA emphasis on expertise and a facts and figures\nAnd knowledge derived from elite to various kinds particularly educational leads but that's often means also economic elites on the one hand and this kind of populist tradition sometimes just as a rhetorical covers sometimes more profoundly put a story about the people being dispossessed of their\nBasic no how an instinctive sense of how things should be and how they are\nAnd Trump vacillates a little between those two registers but I think that\nThe pushback that we might call populist is shorthand comes also from a recent triumph of a more technocratic vision of troops so when Europeans protest against the European Union or Americans complain about politics inside the beltway\nThey're complaining about some of the same things which is a kind of politics that seems cut off from real people that doesn't ask real people what their concerns are doesn't care about their values and populism said you know ... swallow it all out throw out all that I'm\nOff he's skating euphemistic language all that um highbrow highfalutin a studies and get let's get back to what we know\nJust by going about a business you know just the the knowledge that comes from experience living in the world there's something of course really hypocritical perhaps you might say about a man like Trump but any of the number of political leaders have used that language a court tend them\nI had that level of ... trying to pretend they're sort of regular folks but Trump is sometimes described as kind of a cartoon character version of a regular person he sort of richer larger than life but still has the sensibility wow\nHe's there to support your take on or near her a lot of ways and yet he needs are on a author and they get\nOlder richer than everybody yeah\nThanks very much [noise]\nSevere Rosenfeld new book is democracy and truth a short history she's the Walter each Annenberg professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania [noise]\nYou can learn more about this program at our website which is true politics and power dot O.

R. go dot com\nThis is the one thing that is quite challenging one of the things that is a big challenge for democracy is that it is a system that relies on the greatest number of people to sustain it\nAnd the greatest number of people often stand outside of the ministry of apparatus of a democracy namely\nThey stand outside governmental institutions right so that means from a schools churches\nTo philanthropic organizations that means every aspect of society must serve as a training ground for democracy\nAnd that means that the the sort of virtues of the trust of courage that means that the willingness to show care and concern from ones fellows that we otherwise think is the hallmark of a governmental institution must\nAlso become the hallmark of all of those other minor institutions that are just gesture to write you know so that means that by democratic virtue has to run all the way down and that is both that both points to the enormity of the tasks that we have in front of us\nDifficulty of it but it's also contains with it the possibility of of of a different kind of greatness so the thing that makes democracy very difficult is the same thing that contains so many wonderful possibilities\nGetting back to John too easy for just a minute he was as we mentioned demanded many parts one of those parts wasn't as an educator and is it fair to say that he uh\nTo have an informed electorate oh yeah of course he and for great journalist and philosopher ... men and the Nineteen twenties had disagreements about whether or not\nTo sit and read was up to the task of being properly informed and Lipman disagreed and insisted that the demand that democracy places on us as too great\nThat we actually not poised to be properly informed and then in fact we need to rely on that kind of\nIntellectual elite John do just read with that and he disagreed based on the idea that ordinary everyday individuals know where the problems are that affect their life chances\nAnd do we insist that that because they know where the problems are that affect their life chances and immediate where they have a kind of local knowledge and then the aim is to combine that local knowledge was more sophisticated expertise\nTo offer a response is\nThat actually properly track and respond to\nThe concerns of the ... so do it was a very believe that all politics ... local politics I and I think that there is actually some truth to it which is why you see I think in our current moment that if you go from district district as the news has been reporting\nWhat you find that there's a good number of folks animated by by issues on on the ground and they seem to be driven to respond to those issues are on the ground\nAnd this is not to say and I'll I'll stop my point here but this is not to say that there still isn't a sort of deficit and the serious one\nUh in terms of being properly informed there's no way to get on about the business of engaging seriously with the Trump Administration and his base and not think\nThat one is dealing with both of the ministry ... and the citizenry our constituents\nAnd so ah how do we deal with that well the way we deal with that is to 'em and good heart does fashion to vote folks out um and devote other folks in\nThe ... come full circle to your idea of civic virtue NF personal virtue that even if you're not following the news and following every twist and turn of what's happening with the administration you need to make choices about who you are and who our societies and make those choices at the\nLevel of your schools and churches and your civic organizations even if you are not glued to the news every day\nSo two points here the first is yes I think that's absolutely right and the second point which I think is related to the comment that I made earlier than it has to be the case and I have to put it in this in this format has to be the case that one is still open to\nAnd willing to listen\nTo contrary information that is to say information opinions that seemed to to bump up against the views that you have\nAnd the moment in which one is no longer interested in looking at\nData opinion attending to views that stand in tension with one's own then we'll we'll be in big trouble and I think that this was one of the hallmarks right of the of the Trump Administration and in many ways his base and part of what is so damaging about this\nIf in fact it becomes the hallmark of the citizenry as such as that the very capacity we need\nIn order to be responsive to the grievances the problems we find ourselves confronting the very capacity that we depend on that is to say the openness the ability to listen to the other side the moment in which that that goes away\nIs a already dead\nIn these dark times what are you worried about the most\nWhat I worry about the most is that um do we may have been wrong and by implication I'm wrong but I don't worry about that in some kind of um of of sort of self preferential private land the sense that I Would I Would rather be right all the time and we we all get things wrong\nI worry about this because work to be the case or the day we got this wrong then it was largely me that the ideal of democracy or places to grade of demand on us to honor it\nAnd it may be that democracy places to great of a demand on us not merely because of the ideal that it represents but perhaps because it is far too noble um for us to attain and and that's that's what I worry\nAbout and what gives you hope so what gives me hope\nUh again I think comes from John to be but it's not just John do as a whole tradition and that is the sense in which we as ordinary everyday individuals are not set in stone that we are not a fixed creatures\nWith the capacity for transformation and for development is some true to who we are as human beings and then in the context of the United states we have actually made that elasticity of plasticity the hallmark the foundation of a democratic society\nAnd if that's the case then it means that who we seem to be and I'll current treatment of our fellows and our current practices of cruelty need not determine who we will become\nThank you very much thank you now than\nThe science at Brown his forthcoming book is that dark in light of faith race democracy and freedom in African American political
