studies that have come out and we've actually seen a few more come out just in the last couple of weeks I Am showing that the percentage of\nAbsentee or mail in ballots that are rejected I'm for people of color particularly black voters is just abnormally high and a lot of states and so you have a lot of people\nWho want to show up and vote in person because they know their vote will be counted um whereas if you mail in ballot there's a really big chance of particularly you know studies just came out of Florida in Georgia I'm that your ballot isn't going to be counted and so I think yeah definitely there's always an October surprise as easy as something that happens\nUm but then the likelihood of people wanting to change their mind at the last minute I'm\nIn a lot of cases it's going to be less than the likelihood that maybe their ballots going to be rejected and so I think you have to to really balance those things I'm you know again I think maybe if we had the full text of
