public media about the challenges facing our democracy\nThis is the democracy test Trump truth politics and power I'm Neil Conan\nAnd I'm Heather Cox Richardson elections are the essential mechanism of democracy in theory it works because the people decide on candidates ballot issues and so on its elections that give governments their mandates and their legitimacy\nBut there's an important distinction here the way it actually works out it's not the people who decide its voters and those can be two very different groups\nAt the establishment of the republic voters included only white male landowners obviously the right to vote the franchise has expanded considerably over the years but the history of American politics is a story of this in franchise meant as well systematic and deliberate exclusions that continue to the present day\nCare only understand is a professor of African American studies at Emory University her books include white rage\nAnd most recently one person no vote how voter suppression is destroying our democracy\nShe joined us from a conference room there at Emory welcome to the democracy test Carole thank you so much for having me Heather some history in a minute but you described for women I remember the whole problem of making sure that you're official name match the name under which you voted and of course\nAnd they're adults I've always thought that was fascinating example it was just like being down at the um Georgia version of the bureau of motor vehicles\nAnd watching women come in with all of these documents only to be turned away because of the documents aren't lining up with who they say they are and what makes this so infuriating is that all of this mess about voter id is predicated on a lie the lie of voter fraud\nThe lie of massive rampant voter fraud\nAnd that lie has consistently been targeted at the city's saying that in the cities we have\nPeople who are impersonating other people and voting multiple times they're voting from using vacant lots as addresses their you know coming under dead people's names and voting and\nYou tell the lie enough times that it begins to sound like the truth and that's where we are right now so predicated on the lie of voter fraud\nThan we're able to create this almost like rockstar fire that democracy is in peril in only these mechanisms will save democracy but those mechanisms like voter id in fact\nDamage destroy\nThe voting rights of American citizens\nWe said earlier that at the beginning of the republic voting rights normally extended to white males landowners and you know we like to think that there's a story of a steadily expanding franchise is that right\nQuite [laughter] um [laughter] you you know history is about changing continuity and going back and having to redo it all over again so\nWe get this movement um in Eighteen sixty seven the franchise has expanded to black men with the reconstruction activating sixty seven\nAnd then one of their voter id law suits a woman came forward who talked about how many time she had to go to the department of vehicles and never had the appropriate number or types of identification to be able to get the driver's license so that she could vote\nAnd you know that's a really important distinction between the idea that women are going to be radicals and therefore shouldn't have a vote versus the idea that women are going to vote like their husbands and therefore should have the vote\nAnd it's interesting to me that the suffrage movement in the early twentieth century women were very careful to dressed in white and to push their babies in their suffrage parades and to talk about how they were good American citizens and they were supporting their husbands and that's the era in which they get the vote and in fact women\nDo tend to vote like their husbands until the gender gap begins in Nineteen eighty that's when we get the beginning of the gender gap and it's growing ever since until it is now at the largest it's ever been in American history which is I think one of the reasons that people are don't quite know what to do with today's politics\nBecause women are not behaving the way they have in the past and no one quite knows what's gonna happen with that\nYou mean this women behaving badly thing\nWhere women differently thing yes [laughter] right you know that this kind of thing going you know what we should get equal pay for equal work what we should have control over our bodies\nUm we should have the kinds of protections that when our our rights and our bodies are violated\nThat the system works as well for us as it does for those who are doing the violating it quality beef\nMy gosh [laughter] and and and you and we're absolutely seeing that right now frankly\nI'm with this Kavanaugh debacle you've talked about a lot of different things that go into voter suppression what worries you the most what's the most important\nAll ties together I think the one that I find the most pernicious because it's the most hidden\nIs gerrymandering um earlier you had talked about the redrawing of these districts and of course the redrawing of the districts is constitutionally mandated and it's supposed to be done by a legislative body after\nThe the senses to take into account the population shifts and so that we get the kinds of a portion meant\nFor the number of representatives that each state should have in the U.S Congress except the way that it's been done and I mean we started out I mean Patrick Henry gerrymandered to try to to keep James Madison out of the U.S Congress and so\nWe've got a long nap me history of of gerrymandering but what has happened\nSince then after the ... election it took on a kind of\n... it's it's like on anabolic steroids or something I'll talk about Wisconsin and because it's representative of what's going on around this nation\nIn Wisconsin after the twenty ten\nElection a handful of Republicans basically sequestered themselves away in a hotel\nAnd using powerful computer driven mapping software I'm began to read draw the districts the congressional and the legislative districts\nThey had two goals one was to eliminate as much as possible the number of competitive\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ... H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learned more ed E. H. R. go dot com\nFeel like the game as rigged it doesn't matter if I'd vote or not vote because they're going to win anyway and so people stay home they're demoralized vast whatnot competitive districts do they drive a depression in voter turnout\nThe second goal for the Republicans was to say that regardless of how many votes they received they would always get the majority of seats in\nThe state legislature now I Know that that sounds backwards for the way that a democracy works regardless of how many votes we will always get the majority the maps that they drew\nThey were powerful maps to the point where no Democrats were allowed in the process at all\nAnd the Republicans who weren't in that room we're only allowed to see their district but they had to sign a nondisclosure agreement in order to see that district in the twenty twelve election using these newly drawn maps Democrats received fifty two percent of the vote\nAnd gained thirty nine percent\nOf the seats in the state legislature\nAnd to be fair or Republicans would argue that Democrats did pretty much the same thing in a state like Maryland it's just as Republicans control more states than Democrats due to the point\nWhere I think looking to the twenty Eighteen mid term elections projections are that if Democrats hope to win control of the house of representatives or they have to win something like fifty six fifty seven percent of the vote\nExactly that kind of imbalance does\nThe concept of one person one vote and where it also does violence is that because of the ways these districts have been drawn like in Pennsylvania where Republicans receive forty nine percent of the vote but Seventy two percent\nOf the congressional seats is that it has put somewhere between sixteen to twenty six additional GOP seats in Congress\nAnd it's created these kind of rotten boroughs where politicians are able to choose their electorate instead of the electorate choosing them and so they are immune in some ways from the will of the voters\nAnd you talked about dispiriting voters who don't bother to turn out these various things if you go to register to vote and time and time again you turned away 'cause you don't have the right documentation and all these different mechanisms they act to corrode democracy to destroy people's faith in what's going\nExactly I'll take Ohio for instance um in early voting was put in place to try to expand access to the voter booth\nBecause having elections on a Tuesday in November that's generally a work day for a lot of folks and so being able to to get to vote and then get to work when you've got a punch the clock is very difficult\nSo early voting provides access to people particularly working class people\nTo be able to fully participate in American democracy\nWhat Ohio did on the surface it looks equitable Ohio said we will have one early voting site for each county wow each county gets one except the counties are very different ah Cuyahoga County\nCleveland is God or county right exactly a has one point two five million people that's a big county\nWhat happens then is that you have a line for hours long lines in these big county's like Franklin County with Columbia Columbus and Hamilton County uh with Cincinnati\nAnd people are able to just fly through in the smaller counties what they did in North Carolina for instance in Mecklenburg county where Charlotte is\nAnd Charlotte has about seven hundred and fifty thousand people and Fifteen Percent of the states ... black population lives there\nThey reduce the number of early polling sites from twenty\nTwo to four twenty two to four\nAnd the Republicans say they sent out a little note congratulating themselves because by strangling early voting sites this way there were like wow in the twenties sixteen or election in early voting there were like\nAfrican American early voter turnout is down by eight point five percent yes I mean how do you congratulate yourself for denying American citizens the right to vote\nCarolyn Anderson thank you very much thank you Neal thank you so much\nCarolyn Anderson of Emory University her new book is one person no vote how

Heather\nThe cast from a pie and American public media\n... political reporter for NPR News\nFor November and beyond your membership powers to political coverage that keeps Minnesota engaged and informed and show your support today at NPR News dot org slash donate\nHardwick is eventually convicted and find I think it was sixty eight thousand dollars he did not lose his seat as a result of the conviction but lost in the Republican primary would have been the repercussions of what's changed since then\nOne big thing that happened in Montana which I think is a kind of a shining example for the rest of the U.S is that campaign disclosure laws were passed and there was a bill in two thousand and Fifteen and it was called the DISCLOSE Act\nAnd uh that basically specified all sorts of different ways in which the source of funding needs to be disclosed\nThat dark money loophole isn't completely closed because that is something that needs to happen at the federal level but one thing that states can do is to emphasize how much disclose it needs to happen in a way of who who are the funders behind these groups\nUm there's a lot of ways that states can mandate that all of this information is put on line very quickly so that voters can know whether this money is coming from before the elections happened\nOne of the things that I think it's really important to know when you're talking about this and about the dark money coming into Montana and elsewhere is that it's targets are not simply Democrats as targets are Democrats and Republicans anybody who's seen\nAnd not really with the movement conservative agenda you want to talk a little bit more about that\nYeah you know the basic architecture of our film is watching Republicans who some describe them as moderate all although I I mean these guys are pretty conservative Republicans it's not like these are these are squishy Republicans that we're talking to\n... no not at all um these guys are are really ... you know Republicans but they're attacked by a people within their own party that just feel like they don't represent the\nThe ideal said they want their Republican Party has so we're looking at this international battle within the Republican Party that's not to say that\nIt's only Republicans who are involved in dark money spending\nActually over the course of the six years that it's taken me to make this phone\nI think you have to be fair and admit that this dark money spending was really developed in I Would say weaponized at the federal level\nBy the political right but more and more I'm seeing this money spent on the political left for example\nIn the nomination fight for judge Kavanaugh\nThere was a bunch of money spent by a five oh one C. four group she advocate for the\nNomination of judge Kavanaugh but there was also another group that sprang up to oppose that and it did so by using a five on she for dark money group it's important you noticed a couple of things with that one is\nJust this very basic fact that ... when we're talking about dark money spending we're not just talking about candidates running for elected office that we're also talking about judicial nominations and sometimes elections and so let's think about\nThose judicial nominations I\nDon't know who spent money to get Kavanaugh nominated you don't know who spent money to get cabin on nominated but she answers our cabin I'll probably knows who spent money to get Kavanaugh nominated and how are we ever to know whether\nThere should be a recusal in a case that comes before him how do we know if there was any sort of influence that was operating and not nomination fight\nAnd I think it's just important to to realize just how especially pernicious anonymous money is when it comes to the election or nomination of judicial appointees campaign finance is a pretty abstruse subject what what sparked you're interested in is\nIt is abstruse and it's also super important and I think it's a just a really fundamental issue I mean regardless of which political issue that you're passionate about\nAnd which side of the political aisle you're on and it doesn't matter\nBut you can't really figure out any of those political issues until you figure out who's funding it and we're all this money is coming from and where that influences to be honest I didn't quite know what to do with it for a couple of years and chill in two thousand and twelve I saw that my home state of Montana\nOr was going to defend this corrupt practices act of Nineteen twelve that we discussed earlier\nAnd that that case was going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and when that happened it was sort of an a ha moment is like oh this is how we can tell the story of money in politics how we have this strong historical\nResidents how we can wrap it around real people talking about real stuff and not just have this\nMoney and going into this campaign are into that campaign\nBut then I could talk to the attorney general in Montana who was you know bringing up this very important historical case where I could talk to people like Republican candidate for office John Ward and we discussed earlier who\nWas blindsided by a group called you know mothers against child predators who was comparing him to John Wayne Casey\nAnd last but certainly not least is a journalist named John Adams\nWho was a reporter on the ground that was following all of these issues of money in politics and\nInitially in our film is kind of the lens through which we see this whole discussion play out\nBut when he actually gets laid off and faces a lot of the challenges\nThat the rest of the newspaper industry is going through John really becomes emblematic of not only how important it is to have great investigative reporters\nFollowing these issues of money in politics but he also becomes emblematic of what's going on with with the press in general and the newspaper industry in those financial challenges that newspapers are going through across the country today and um how important it is to\nTo follow the money how much you really need to have investigative reporters who were on the case who are who are ah hunting down these stories\nSpeaking to follow the money you're you even argue in the film that campaign finance was at the heart of the greatest political drama of our luck but my lifetime anyway you'd be younger than me and that's Watergate\nYeah that's right the former FCC chairman and unravel a tells the story about you know even the most people remember\nProbably probably through the lens of all the President's Men are for good reason\nBut why don't they really started and ended up as a campaign finance scandal it started with your suitcases full of cash on the floor of the oval office or that we're there to pay off the people who broke into the Watergate hotel\nAnd the whole mechanism that they had to buy these people off\nWas hiding money a that was coming from political contributions so it really was a dark money scandal\nAnd the whole campaign finance system that we're dealing with today really came about because it was such public outcry against just sort of corruption\nBut once again we're talking about ways to hide money in political campaigns and if folks are looking for for hope these days and times that um I think there's a lot of people on all sides at the ... really frustrated with ... with our political system and how polarized things are\nThere was a lot of foreign that came about in the wake of Watergate and um if if you're looking for help I think it's it's not unreasonable to see ourselves in the same situation and\nAnd be preparing ourselves for another wave of reform in the wake of the\nCorruption that we're hearing about today Thanks very much thank you so much for having me Kimberly reached film is called dark money\nHeather we spend a lot of this hour in the Jim Crow south and dark money Montana I wanted to put voting

R. go dot com\nNPR News dot org slash donate will go back to our conversation about what life is like at the end of the Mississippi River and it's an event we recorded in July in the rose Louisiana ... we were in partnership\nWith W W N o public radio in New Orleans and he didn't win Lund is the news director they're\nTaken um would you just explain for audience what's going on with this island where they basically have to retreat from the water sure ... chief ...\nTribe lives nearby another tribe that is really at at some of those folks are your relatives\nOn on this island called ill to Sean and Charles and they received a very substantial grant of about forty eight million dollars from the U.S department of housing and urban development\nDo allow them to move north about forty miles and so this has been grappling with how to make that happen and how to preserve their native life ways as they make that transition to an area that is\nFlat maybe you know grassy nothing like what they call home living off the land and water and in my reporting I've really found that coastal Louisiana represents sort of the last vestiges of\nAmerican I'm a ... like sort of independence there's there's so there was traditionally so much opportunity here like you could just have a high school diploma or not even and you get a a great job\nIn the fishing industry and make Seventy thousand dollars a year and I think traditionally that that was true in America back in the day\nAnd you don't see that very much anymore and so I understand that the value of the places it's not just I identity but it's a way of life that we're talking about walking away from her losing one of the things that we've heard through the weekend I guess we've wrestled with is\nPeople saying this is my part of the river and I have to protect that legacy and that livelihood and that may not fit with what goes on in your part as\nYou're part of the river Don um what how does that sound to you I mean that's part of the complexity of this right\nWe're a part of my job as a community organizer is filled the room with different ideas and I will say that we are in a fragile position because we have a lot of solutions at a table a lot of local people have solutions to the problem\nBut the ... is the financing of those solutions um department and of those solutions to stay have their own play and so one of my main objective is to merge these state plant with community organizing sort of community can have a voice\nAnd yes it is different because when we filled the room with different voices and because you know down here in the south we love each other we have close knit community is what oftentimes family fight\nAnd how do you facilitate those conversations when you when you were saying hey you might have to move out hey I might have to bring water into this community that if your argument or if you freeze a crowd with something they might affect your livelihood but it's better for my family\nSo how do we for let's say those conversations and so we are in a good place because we have solutions but this conversation is so fragile and it really takes the community coming together\nAnd I'm leaving out all the politics let's just have a conversation it's family first\nI'm going to walk over here to David who you are a shrimper\nWell here Don say that and and the chief say this about you may have to take a hit on the way your livelihood goes because we're we have to look at other interests besides yours how well do you think that's usually balanced yeah\nI I don't think that's a a fair statement at all for people to live in my area um I think it's a tragic statement to save one group\nOr to make sure that nobody gets a their area flooded are basically going to draw a line in the sand and create some Lebanese systems are that's going to flood an area that I live in I don't I don't think that's that's a fair thing to do to sacrifice one group of people to save another\nIs there any other way to do this to come up with solutions that some people are basically going to be on the losing end or is there any way to do this that there is not going to be some kind of loss Denise maybe ever thought on this\nOh my gosh my head space has been so much clearer listening\nTo those ... you're going to find wall\nTo wall campaign advertising on a lot of other media outlets and\nWe are campaign ad free we've got the debates we've got the big idea discussions we've got the issues that's the stuff you really care about is voter you're not going to make your

somebody who cares about science you care about literature you care about our sense of identity here in the state of Minnesota and our sense of who we are as Americans we've tackled all\nIt'd be adding to the approach that we take to the news and information eight hundred to two seven twenty eight eleven on line at NPR News dot org slash donate we've been listening to this I opened in town hall discussion that we recorded in July\nAt the end of the Mississippi River in little rose Louisiana was part of our weeklong focus on fly over down the Mississippi and our goal was simple we wanted people upstream an downstream to hear what life is like at the top and the end of the river\nDon I'm the patients that you've required from people with vested interests in the solution is pretty extreme isn't it\nYes it is very strange but what I often try to communicate to us the mole was saying that we we always changing uh in high school I may in high school during the summertime I'm a six hundred dollars a week\nWorking at ... my daddy worked ... there were the money was I got on my ... every day early in the morning and went to the government and I work I was a world of ... right out of school I became a welder McDermott is no longer there\nSo amount of oil day anymore so I think we have to train the next generation a train them to do something different which also can't contribute to their community where people patients run then it runs low and that's why we have to have many many conversations\nChief would you say something about that well as a Native American our people have been in our territory since time immemorial we've already given up more than enough I refuse to give up our homes I'm going to do whatever it takes we have always had to adapt\nWe're still adapting today and a lot of it came from no fault of our own and we right\nI'll be done the same way that they've been done\nAnd we've been speaking to that for over forty years now my mostly my men my shrimpers ... my commercial fishing men we'd go out and they would see land and then the next minute it was gone and they would get there and try to talk to the powers that me and say hey we have a problem\nBut because they didn't hold degrees\nAnd they they didn't have certifications they were never listen to\nTheir knowledge was never utilized I think we're starting to make changes there because we have so many different organizations now I'm near like USDA and all of these different organizations that are actually wanting to learn from the communities from the local knowledge\nYou know that we've had and that we've been trying to bring forth and\nLooked change is going to come\nWhether we want it or not\nI I Would think it would be smarter if we were the ones that were in charge of our change and worked with our planet rather than against or\nThere's no doubt that a master plan picks winners and losers to use a political term right I mean there's just no question about that [noise]\nWell I don't think we're going to say everything you know um but I think you know historically we've been\nHaving to make those type of decisions for many many years here in the food we had to lay out the levee system way back in the sixties and say we're going to run\nAnd you know we had a excellent group of businessmen on our lovely district that have done that and we have other excellent groups now that are saying you know what's really important to saving a the economic base so people can have jobs\nAnd at the end of the day it saves our culture because then that gives us you know jobs in a place to live here\nLance so one of those solutions I was a part of\nIt was going to be displaced with diversions and coastal restoration projects was ah\nThey were training the fisherman to uh\nYou know use their knowledge of the water is to help with a marsh restoration planning and stuff like that so there was a group of about twenty five fisherman that were trained in a water survival CPR you know an array of things we were trained in but uh it never came to fruition we had the training and\nWe were promised jobs in no jobs ever came from it so you know that's one of the things I think that should be looked at when a when fishermen are going to be displaced does have some sort of\nMake you know ways and means for them to make a living until\nThings get back to where you know they figure out what they're going to do\n... um my biggest thing is we keep saying that you know we want our voices be heard but I thought this would be packed and look at all these empty chairs you know we\nWe sometimes we side with the oil and gas company because they provide us jobs but\nThey should be held accountable we should be able to work it out together and we don't want to kick them out and want them here\nWe also sometimes tend to vote against their own interests you know I mean this is\nHow many people here I don't want anybody to raise their hand would believe that you know manmade climate change is contributing to I've you know rising water levels and sometimes we tend as a community or to vote against our best interest and I just I thought this place would be screaming so that vices could be hurt\nAs far as I'm individuals' voices been her one of the challenges as an organizer is teaching people how to play chess and not checkers there as a as a lot of things that happened in our government and it's easy I on one of them is easy to blame a politician but when you go into a politician office and you talk to him\nAnd then he explained to you the tax base and then he explained to you to individually they'll come to the town hall then he or she said down on my hand what you're saying then I had to go back into the community\nThat you

violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day or so the first thing we become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the fight if you do it comes through in its reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might violate our policy so for instance terror propaganda now we remove of the terror propaganda that we removed from Facebook more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags it for us\nNow once content has been flagged as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nAre and making a decision if it violates the policy than ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up that's\nGot to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area of the person is working in all constant reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise we have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent\nOf people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have NATO\nThe other way that language is used so that's a big focus in our hiring\nOnce you're hired as a constant review or you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one so for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm\nWhen you catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook that violates the terms\nWhat's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it is the kind of thing to say a reviewer or bought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with we\nStill rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side that said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag violating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it's harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can slide the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very can textual for instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or\nAt our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the worded I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch so it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look\nTopics as opposed to content patterns how does that pattern recognition work\nWell we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves\nFor instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we'll remove your account even if you're not otherwise violating our content policies we also have policies against terror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance wanted to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens in rain does we would still remains it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's representing al ... page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that is going to come through to our review teams

T. as the there's the veteran suicide\nIt enters the same type of a peso us as\nAh the opiate crisis right where these people have given up themselves for our country and yet they're they're in a mental health state where they choose to to end their lives and so we believe that through just the experiences we've had thus far we're working with a focus group\nAnd there was it and and once again I'm not trying to make a medical claim this is anecdotal evidence based on a focus group with which we worked with for over a year\nThere was a gentleman on suicide watch who was able to utilize night where and within two days the the the people providing care to him were able to downgrade his chances of suicide ... so it's had very profound effect\nIn multiple cases and what we're hoping to Barrow with the randomized clinical trial\nSo how many habits can you're apt to help out with\nSo we're very focused on these body focus repetitive behaviors that the umbrella term for this mental health condition so that's ... nail biting\nOr the price that itself can train up to four gestures at any given time\nOr the idea though is to start with one\nTo start learning how king works in terms of its gesture detention is Tina's are smart faces yes how the bracelet worse but more importantly\nWhy you were doing this behavior what is the underlying trigger whether it's stress anxiety sleep Fordham trauma so that you can start recognizing when it's happening why it's happening how it's happening\nAnd start using that information to actually\nEffect change in the right way for example for Twenty

utilizing wearable technology to make someone aware of their own behaviors and that's a very appropriate use\nOf technology for for mental health and and there are many out there there are hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in digital therapeutics for mental health\nAnd and so by augmenting what mental health professionals are already able to do with off the shelf technology that is

psychotherapy it's really broadening the number of people that can get mental health care and provide mental health care and potentially ... making the entire ecosystem more healthy and so I think\nTo to speak about what we're doing in context of what's already in place 'cause there are so many professionals doing great work across the board and they all want to do more so how do we get the data and get the outcomes necessary so that they feel comfortable prescribing and recommending\nSo I really feel that it's in the case of Tyler I saw what he was doing\nA and I said I see something there and I started to work with him and\nDevice and mental health professionals here in the twin cities area and then we really started to get some momentum early last year\nI totally agree with ... it's it's not about you know taking the customer away from treatment professional if you will if it's about in racing technology so that they can do their job better so that power of awareness\nThat we're both creating is now enabling someone to use the tools that they are taught from their treatment professional you can't change what you don't know what's happening but now\nIf you are aware you can

that have built companies where they're taking so much risk they're they're in for tens of millions hundreds of millions of dollars pre market and they've got provider partners right there with them and so the willpower and the steely resolve of Minnesotans has really come through and so\nIn in the case and night where we've we've greatly benefited from that are in in many different ways uh\nAccess to capital or having spent\nFifteen Years in San Francisco I've been in contact ah with investors and I can say that they don't blink an eye and when I say that we're in Minnesota and we're not interested in moving to the coast\nThat they understand that there is this there's this run on talent on the coasts and so the cost of acquiring talent and recruiting people in the competition for talent\nAnd the lack of expertise and regulated industries has really come to bear right there's going to be your top players out at Stanford and places like that but in terms of the threats of capability here ah you know\nThere's been so much talk this week about male and it's for good reason right there are just so many fantastic institutions\nThat that we're able to benefit from and so while there isn't a huge amount of\nSources here that you would find on the coast or it's never been easier for a Minnesota company to raise money and build a team here and not have to move to another geography and I'm\nSo one of my puzzle messages are there are a lot of apps\nThat are growing that are out there so how does the consumer to figure out which app has you know a scientific basis to it that this is\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ... H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learned more ed E. H. Argo dot com or experience\nAnd the user interface and you know or or their little prompts I can get it in my day to day lives as of integrate well in my life which is kind of on the experience side\nUp but there are certainly those that would be you know at the political side and so we we strive to provide both types of access to information experience so that you know when our sophisticated consumers are looking across the array of apps\nUm they know what we are and and I think also by distinction they know what we're not\nNew for us we benefit from\nThis body focus repetitive behavior community being fairly close knit so they're on line in online support groups sharing information sharing what's working whether it's you know keep that keen bracelet or another replacement strategy\nAnd so for us it we've been benefiting simply from the results that we've been able to to create and people sharing they're good they're good experience with the product in building their awareness heightening you know that knowledge of where their hands are so that they can make change\nAnd what about with the the professional community\nAnd the ... the same exact thing that the ... you know the first step of cognitive behavioral therapy is awareness and that's exactly what we're providing and that's why so many colleges are on board with what we're doing because now their patients are doing that homework and that session is just so much more impactful because\nThey can talk about what's really wrong it's really happening\nEveryone needs to learn cognitive behavioral therapy not just people with mental health issues this is like his life like if you can teach a child in a behavioral therapy all of these things are elements and ...\nThat you can go and take on any challenge in life it's not just the mental health adversity you're going to someone in your life if you're going to die or you're getting into a car accident or you're going to lose your

can just really see the promise of what all three of you are talking about\nBut what is the limits\nI think that's\nTo be determined I I Believe that\nDigital mental health tools will become the most prolific category of mental health treatment because of the ubiquity of data once again a practitioner\nWho was in an intensive therapy can only get covered for ten to twelve sessions so at best that's ten to twelve hours with a person over the span of a couple of months and so if they're able to benefit from that data\nWho knows where this can go in fact within our focus group\nOr a a veteran prescribe a severe PATS the is utilizing night where for daytime anxiety disorder so utilizing the sensors on the watch setting their threshold to make them aware of daytime anxiety disorder and so\nTo your point about consumer applications there are hundreds of sleep apps out there\nAnd they're very limited in what claims they can make and they're they're limited in what\nIn in where they can go from a a professional medical\nA perspective in terms of coverage with one cab yet and I want to commend both companies because there are\nSupport comes from urban homework stable homes

programs like ours that do a lot of checking during the day that are also Web based um that tackle very specific issues that also then learned to connect to a a bigger ecosystem and that's one thing to an eel is point I think it's exciting even about here in Minnesota\nIs that here the three of us said with complimentary offerings I and also I think one of the things that will prove itself out over time is those with the real outcomes those with those that have great capital fish and sea or those that have you know when when we're on the west coast you know we're fortunate to here I think at first\nWhen they say you know you have great bone structure you know with your company you've done a lot with a little\nYou know and uh I've learned to really take that as a compliment bats are on the head it feels like they're you know they're sitting at higher and I said yeah um but I but I think\nThere's the reality of that is you know we've been very focused on outcomes and we've grown over time to really make sure that as we scale that we we keep our outcomes in a very specific place and consumers know that you know they're they're very sophisticated and\nThe organizations we partner with no that as well and so I think the the proven apps what are you know apps are wearables will be the ones that that stand up and then link to other points of care in the cause of\nIndia what about

know how he felt about actually recruiting informants\nWell he says he felt conflicted I mean here he was a sworn FBI agent knowing full well it was illegal to leak classified information to the press but he says he didn't agree with how the FBI was going into communities of color to turn people into informants\nAnd as an African American agent he says he felt racially isolated depressed and that he experienced racial discrimination within the bureau\nI should say that the FBI has acknowledged it needs to diversify its ranks it does remain largely white organization in court records safe fewer than seven percent of the staff in the ...\nParties so what are prosecutors saying about this\nWell they say no matter his motivations all very abused the public trust they say if he was so offended

year has attracted a record number of algae to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that as we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican or ...\nAnd I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run a million ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at the table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table and and you know it's it's hard for me to separate being an allergy to be the woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans\nAre definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations damn you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades and the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nThis is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell I remember that and I've got you know some wonderful fellows in and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm\nThe good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so in so little time um but it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way of says he and twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh\n[laughter] and I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard to murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but\nWhen you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first president to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy\nThe person doesn't like the ... community and I would say that there are certainly in both parties folks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about I mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans women especially trans woman of color into their political scene", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Rochester", "day": "16"}
