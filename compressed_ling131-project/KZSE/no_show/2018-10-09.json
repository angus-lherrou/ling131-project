H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology in healthcare learn more at E. H. R. go dot com\nFranklin Roosevelt to address could he a recreate face than hope in a a democratic institutions\nBecame a important significant and isolation as it was a pretty much in the saddle we had these neutrality laws that aimed uh keep us out or involvement in the European conflicts\nAnd the Roosevelt was not going to breach that he didn't want to rush into anything that would cost him a populist support Dede in Nineteen forty one\nThe British ambassador pressed Roosevelt to go to Congress and ask for a declaration of war heroes we'll said I could do it and I could get majorities in both houses but\nAt off first setbacks and the fighting or lose that consensus\nAnd uh he saw that as impermissible and so that was an act of great political shrimp ... on his part\nBecause of course in that sense Pearl Harbor was a godsend to unite the country and bring it into the war as a a a a solid failings of a support\nWell that does beg the question now how did he hold on to popular support when his critics on the right we're calling him a dictator and a communist and of course his policies did know succeed after some recovery early on FDR cut back\nThe economy how didn't Roosevelt managed to keep Americans behind him\nWell in fact if they had not in World War two if the war had broken out Nineteen thirty nine\nI don't think Roosevelt would have been able to win a third term\nBecause in his second term when as you just described the country\nHad that recession and a Roosevelt Nineteen thirty eight try to defeat conservatives and the Democratic party in the primary elections specially across to the south and he uh the fell short in\nAll but one instance in fighting the conservatives in his party and I don't think he ever could have gotten the nomination again and certainly not the winner third term so it was a war that really in a sense gave him the second opportunity\nAnd the country rallied around him and of course the fact that we ended up winning the war brings him down to rush through history as one of the three great presidents of American history you\nSaid earlier that Roosevelt did and and the depression relieved that in fact the war mobilization\nEnded the effort or your biography does not shy away from\nFranklin Roosevelt to mistakes or from his failure to take in Jewish refugees from his failure to address racial issues more forcefully his decision to turn Japanese Americans in the second World War given all of that and more you still argue that his legacy is one of greatness\nWell it is because he was a brilliant leader in that he used radio to reach people in the grassroots so to speak and if you look at the polling data throughout his presidency at least in the Gallup polls\nSee what a contrast that is to the current incumbent who is never achieved fifty percent\nIn his going on two years in the White House you see now it speaks to Rochelle ... ... as a politician and\nYes there were stumbles those shortcomings there were limitations but again he reflected the public mood in the country when you know he didn't press the case energetically to rescue ... knowledge costs\nHe was reflecting the mood in the country which was very much anti immigration there was a lot of feeling that at the end of the war the country was going to get back into a recession or depression\nAnd that bringing in lots of immigrants would add to the unemployment rolls and so Roosevelt was very reluctant to challenge that outlook that sentiment you see and also as late as Nineteen forty four people in the country we were asked\nIf they believed that the Nazis systematically killing Jews in concentration camps and something like sixty percent of the poll said they didn't believe that they thought it was what time propaganda from the British\nHad joined us into World War one and so they were very skeptical of that\nI'm going to go back to something you said before and use it to look forward you alluded to the fact that FDR might well not a one third term\nAnd it was really World War two that pushed out into the creation of the liberal state the new deal state yes are you saying that we might not have had that state if it had not been for World War two\nWell it is certainly a loud roast\nThink that there were things that he had already put in place like Social Security\nYou'll see an approval in Nineteen thirty five ... through the Wagner Act for a labor unions\nLegitimizing them and I don't think those would have disappeared because you see once you get things like Social Security and more recently Medicare or look how difficult it's been\nTo overturn the Affordable CARE Act that President Obama put in place to see\nWell here's the next question then behind that what it changed how was American society how American democracy different in Nineteen forty five than it had been in Nineteen thirty to write an FDR done or how it American Made such a profound change\nIt was it was a permanent change that this sort of notion that you were going to have some kind of ... involvement of the federal government in the national economy in a providing a bedrock of support\nFor people who are are less fortunate than the ... society that these had become accepted propositions of the society and that they're not going to be repealed you know Social Security and Medicare\nI don't think they're ever going to go away as long as we have a democracy in the Democratic voting with a small D in this country because these are institutions that strike resident in ... with people\nYou see the new deal humanized the American industrial system\nAnd lots of things that Lyndon Johnson did added to that and\nObama added to that and so people don't want that to go away yes there is a certain conservative impulse and the country and they still have faced it a a self help the notion of ...\nPeople increasing the prosperity and having a better life the children these are still central propositions I think of American society and of the American ...\nSo I don't think this material will go away it was pretty much a change in the twentieth century than industrialized society could not continue to operate the way it had it a nineteenth century economic and political culture\nRobert Dallek thank you very much\nRobert Dallek the latest presidential biographies Franklin Delano Roosevelt [noise]\nComing up after a break how the inequality gap sort again over the past Fifteen Years ago that undermines our democracy and when we could learn from American history about making

A. L. U. N. E. N. law\nDot com this is the democracy test from truth politics and power I'm Heather Cox Richardson\nAnd I'm Neal Conan by any measure the economic boom that followed the second World War was phenomenal here's one number gross domestic product two hundred and twenty eight billion dollars in Nineteen forty five one point seven trillion in Nineteen Seventy five\nAs in any period some did better than others but no group prospered more than the white middle class this was the arrow in automobile production exploded America built the interstate highway system a housing boom created vast tracts of new homes in New suburbs that wants to norms gap between rich and poor shriveled\nA variety of efforts geared to this ah I think the open primary and California is one that many of us are watching closely I think the results so far been mixed\nThere are suggestions about creating more of a kind of run off system you've heard ranked choice voting as a possibility is being tried in Minnesota I think the main too you know and then and you know right choice voting intriguing idea and I think the results there also a bit mixed\nAnd deserved further analysis I did not think there's a magic bullet I think the most fundamental thing is to engage the majority of Americans when you have about half the country sitting out presidential elections\nAnd two thirds of the country are so sitting out midterm elections and even larger numbers sitting out local elections and then you've got the people in power making decisions that are really quite extreme these are not the kind of Nineteen sixties or Nineteen\nThese are people once they're in power they're going for it\nAnd if they don't they know that they will be replaced then the next primary the sense of moderation response from this responsibility to the majority of Americans has disappeared\nAmong our political elites those who are in office or are closely connected to the process that elects officials there's been a major break down than the norms and the behavior of our political leaders today it's about go as far as you can as fast as you can\nVersus the pattern before the Nineteen seventies which was a bit more cautious and emphasize building coalitions and finding where the majority of Americans were at least on salient top of the agenda issues\nWhich brings us back full circle to where we started which is your correlation of people's faith in the government with the Democratic process\nAnd that brings us to a point where we have opinion polls that show the policies that would reduce inequality higher minimum wage for example whole show those are broadly popular but those have been Norman's difficulties getting an act it is that the result of this polarization of the political parties that using\nAbsolutely I think one of the biggest signs one of the most significant vital signs of a democracy is whether those in office\nListening to what the majority prefer and America we're in a dangerous on again and again on the major policies\nFacing our country particularly so is affecting the economic well being of Americans you find majorities of Americans supporting those policies whether it's health care reform minimum wage\nAnd others and then you find a political class in Washington and our state government that are on moved\nOnto what most Americans prefer instead they couched how to the ideologically extreme activist within their party they know if they don't follow the party line that they will be replaced and that has become a tremendous corrupting influence\nThe path forward for beginning to address the deep and growing economic inequality is with America is well known we don't need to study for it the problem is that our political process is paralyzed\nAnd has been unable to respond to this transformation of our economy that is driving the upper classes even higher and stagnating are pushing down just about everybody else that America\nI'm actually an optimistic person by nature but I'm also someone who follows\nResearch and data and I find this moment in American politics to be very sobering this is a hard period for me as someone who studies politics and public policy to be optimistic we're really at each other's throats\nBut here's something that I find interesting which is when you leave Washington or state capitals and you go out and you spend time with people in the country\nThere's some things that are developing that I find quite interesting I see a lot of energy\nParticularly among young people and folks who maybe have not been part of the political process I see a lot of communities coming together and looking for solutions because they know they can't trust Washington in her state capitals\nI'm also encouraged that even over these policies that are so polarized like health reform we see movement if you look carefully I've been doing a study with a colleague at Cornell University\nIn a group of Americans since twenty ten when the Affordable CARE Act was passed and when we started it was what you'd expect our group of Americans representative of the country were very divided along party lines\nBut now that we're moving into the eighth or ninth year of the four to CARE Act we're starting to see real movement\nWhere Republicans would favor repeal are now saying well maybe this is not such a bad idea let's see if we can improve it\nWe're starting to see greater support for some of the very concrete provisions like protections against preexisting condition exclusions or expanded Medicaid coverage or subsidies or benefits for seniors and as some of those partisan divisions of B. gun to break down\nWe're also starting to see the uptick in political advocacy that sense that the government response to me and said I've got the capacity\nTo influence government to me that's a hopeful sign and it goes against the grain\nOf our political process the question is will our elected leaders listen\nThank you very much for being with us here today Larry yeah pleasure this is Lawrence Jacobs at the University of Minnesota his books include class war what Americans really think about economic inequality which he wrote with Benjamin page [noise]\nWanted to ask you about this you've just finished a book about the tension between democracy and oligarchy through American history I Wonder whether what some see as the golden age of the post war boom is that the American worry about a prosperous society where many people have opportunities or is that\nAn anomaly and that kind of inequality we saw in the Nineteen twenties or today is that more than ... you know I think we actually\nWe have periods in American history where people really focus on equality of opportunity and the gap between the rich and the poor tends to get a lot smaller than it does at other times and then there's the policies that you need to put in place to guarantee equality of opportunity\nCosts money they cost tax dollars and they have in the ability of people at the top of society to do whatever they want and they start to get angry about that and they fuel a backlash against that kind of legislation\nSo you have after periods when you have an expansion of equality of opportunity say in the Eighteen sixties\nOr in the progressive era or in the Nineteen fifties you get a backlash against that that tends to be racist and it tends to be anti immigrant it often is anti female and you get the argument that any kind of equality of opportunity any kind of government attempts to guarantee equality of opportunity\nCosts too much money they cost too much tax dollars and therefore are infringing on the liberty of people with money\nAnd you get as I say this Xena phobic and racist backlash that tends to make sure that money concentrates increasingly at the top of society until you get to a place as we were in the Eighteen fifties or the Eighteen nineties or the Nineteen twenties or the president\nWhere there's way too much money at the very top and not enough in the next Ninety nine percent and you have to have a revolution in the system and I don't mean literally a revolution as in guns in the streets but people's minds have to change and the governmental system has to change and it does it's happened cyclical throughout our history\nWell let's go back to the actual revolution or were there were drunk or at least most groups and right after the period when the framers wrote and adopted the Constitution's now obviously there were enormous opportunities where the continent are behind you are but\nSee fairness as a goal so when the phone to talk about the revolution they're not actually talking about\nMines that takes place before it to them the fighting was actually sort of not exactly hottest all that sort of uh the way you cemented the change in ideas that had happened before the fighting broke out so when you talk about the revolution and what they were really thinking about was the way people thought about government\nAnd what that meant was the acceptance of colonial's at the time they're not Americans yet but the acceptance of colonial's of the idea\nThat all men are created equal and of course you gotta put fences around that they meant white men they tended to mean ... men of property they certainly didn't include women but the concept that all people had equal natural rights was indeed revolutionary\nAnd it was not clear that that kind of a government the idea that people should have a say in their own government\nTheir own in the rules under which they lived it was not at all clear that that was actually workable that this was gonna actually turned into a country that\nCould survive so in the Seventeen nineties when they're first hashing out what the world will look like or what America will look like under the constitution people are really really worried about the rise of monarchy\nSupport comes from top shelf creators

excluded from the process you are treated as\nThe least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as

series we're calling this American moment we're talking with writers and scientists orders artists activists and religious leaders about the long view\nWhere we find ourselves in this moment of American Life and what it says about who we are\nWe're also asking our guest to reflect on how they maintain a sense of clarity in a world that feels pretty chaotic and disordered we're opening the series with Carol Anderson she's a scholar political scientist and share of African American studies at Emory University in Atlanta\nHer new book is an investigation of voting laws and disenfranchisement for voters of color in America and she examines a history that goes back to the years after the civil war\nBut her book also concludes with examples including here in Minnesota of efforts to remove impediments to the ballot box and perhaps\nClarity on the road ahead Carol Anderson's new book is titled one person no vote and she joined us today from Atlanta Georgia Carol welcome back to the show and I'm really grateful that you're inaugurated our new series so thank you for that as well oh I thank you for having me in a larger more philosophical\nSense does this\nMoment in American Life feel precarious to you does it feel in any way hopeful for you\nTake a step back and tell me how you perceive that\nIt feels like we are it feels like we can go one or two ways\nUm where we can go the road less traveled or whether we can fall into the abyss that's what it feels like right now I'm it feels like the kind of chaos or before the civil war it feels like the\nThe the chaos the the [noise]\nThe intense intensity of rights violations or during the civil rights movement it um\nIt feels like the last gasp of white supremacy trying to strangle liberty and democracy out of the United states of America\nIs there a sense though with all of that urgency\nAnd all of the\nThe precarious as of what you've just described that people are engaged\n[noise] yes and yes and that that really is truly where the hope is um and it's the kind of engagement where and I I Would say that for many years I Would say that many Americans have been rather complacent\nIgnored the less you participate right it's driving out people who are\nI I I guess I think of them is kind of on the fence should I be involved in this give me a maybe they're the people who say give me a good reason a better reason than just everybody every American citizen ought to vote [noise]\nBright and and so one of the things I mean and you you ... if we were on video you would just see me nodding my head [laughter] issue written rocket I'm\nBecause this is what happens in that that that skewing in his like give me a reason so I Will go to when I talked in the book about ah the resistance yeah I'm In Alabama one of the things that they did in Alabama is as they're talking to people who\nHad been just pounded on by the state in terms of massive voter suppression um and so people are the the activist or talking to people in the community going\nYeah so what what ... what do you care about and people would start talking about well I care about schools I Want my kids to be in good schools and you know I Want to be able to get to the doctor or in and not have to choose between\nYou know going to the doctor or or going bankrupt um I Want to be able to to have a clean water I mean if people are talking about the things that are important to them\nThen it becomes really clear the way that those things that are important to the way that people live their lives the quality of their lives is absolutely embedded in the policies that him and ate out of these governmental institutions\nAnd it's from that moment understanding how the quality of your life is set by the ... the legal frame\nUm that are are are put in place then you begin to understand why\nVote why vote\nIt it's such a challenge though I think today to make that connection right because Washington feels so disconnected from your everyday life in a city in Texas or a small\nTown in Alabama or ... you know my I landed up or is that people feel like they have the luxury\nVoters feel like they have the luxury to say I'm sitting it out and it won't matter what I hear you saying is it matters in so many ways that you haven't even accounted for exactly\nAnd it matters as well that we're not just talking about Washington We're talking about who you're governor is who you're secretary of state is who sets up the election\nFrameworks um it it matters in terms of who you're mayor is city council person who's on your zoning board who's on your school board all of those things matter to the the quality of the functioning of the administration\nSo that you can live your life to the fullest with those things go off the rails when it when a system is for instance replete with corruption than things aren't happening in your community that should be happening\nI'm when I'm there's dereliction of duty when people who aren't competent\nAre at the helm than things that should be taken care of routinely are not and we feel that most urgently in the moment of crisis say a hurricane um\nOr a

C. is that the way that our system has been gerrymandered\nUm we have sixteen to twenty six additional Republican representatives in the U.S Congress than would normally be there if the district lines had been drawn I'm In a non extreme partisan away\nWith that also does is it has created these districts where people are safe where the politicians are safe from the will of the voters so this is why you see these massive disparities between the polls talking about what people want ... and ...\nAs the Republican majority was trying to gut the Affordable CARE Act\nYou had Seventy percent of the American population talking about they wanted that actually strengthened not got it but the politicians were moving forward in trying to dismantle um the Affordable CARE Act not strengthened it how do you explain that war\nHow um you had about twenty percent of the American population was for the tax bill that went through that provided one point five trillion dollars of benefits just reading the U.S treasury the kitty\nUm for the job or wealthy\nOnly twenty percent of the American population thought that was a good idea and that may be trickle down would work it it hasn't it doesn't but you saw that tax bill sailed through so how is it that you had eighty percent who are against it\nBut the bill sales through you know what\nMan during when I think of this issue and I connected to a specific issue in debate in Washington I think about Medicare negotiating on drug prices ... is there is there a clear indication of\nThe connection between I'm safe in my seat I'm safe enough to\nIgnore a lot of what my voters and voters at large in America say about this issue or to to except you know the\nApproval and the money of the big pharmaceutical company so for me that issue really says disconnected from what American voters want and safe to let it be the way it has been for so many\nExactly and the and again this gets to the way that we live our lives and so while this may seem 'em you know distant and remote you think about what access to 'em [noise]\nI think that um\nIt's been a long time since I've been in school [laughter] but I think that\nPart of it is is that we get um a very kind of flatten narrative in terms of of American history and civic engagement that uh this kind of progress there were the founding fathers and they created this fabulous constitution\nAnd then\n... there was a civil war in the north one\nDay and then\nYou know there was this thing called over over one I don't know what that was but then there was like a ... World War two\nWe have a lot of skipping over for history of egg I hated saying [noise] right\nRight and what it means and what it means that so it just feels like there's this kind of blight through and that's it just happens in that to me that builds and a kind of complacency that\nDemocracy just works in that you just have a few people who are you know making decisions and not making decisions and boom wow\nAnd so we miss what that full engagement looks like and we miss the battles over the right to vote and engagement\nAnd when we have the opportunity so for for instance in North Carolina before twenty ten in North Carolina North Carolina um had high schoolers six\nKeisha that's great yeah well when the Republicans took over [laughter] they didn't want those young folks voting\nAnd so they eliminated in their their modified\nA voter registration pieces voter suppression peace where they did the voter id where they did the gerrymandering where they did the closing of the polls where they did the constriction of the early voting hours they also we lemonade it pre registration for Seventeen year olds\n[noise]\nSo I just [laughter] I Know [laughter] but right but only on the flip on the flip side of it\nUm [noise] California um that has a very low voter turnout rate like forty two percent I Believe\nI'm it's secretary state was dissatisfied with that and said we have got to do better and looked at what Oregon did with automatic voter registration is that a ha I'm and was automatic voter registration Oregon um which is one of the high is\nNot as high as Minnesota Dr Frick hide in that I'm telling you I was like a\nVoter turnout rate 'em when Oregon implemented automatic voter registration\nTheir voter turnout rate increased actually as well as the diversity of their electorate increased and so California looked at that if that were going to go you one better and Ella foreign your pre register sixteen and Seventeen year olds to vote\nAnd that has been gone to look like a swell this massive wonderful beautiful democratic swell in the electorate you know and it's not like they're saying only Democrats are only Republican\nThat's how we have this democracy um and so by including sixteen or Seventeen year olds that that is part of that civic engagement it gets people understanding that your your you have the right to vote when you exercise that power\nWow we have a very different kind of America we have an America that for instance begins to deal with the issues of student loans wow\nKirsten in leg feel called Carol to say she thinks one of the reasons that voters aren't more keen on participating as that you have no control over what happens after the election there is an accountability for those elected officials until the next time they're up for for election\nI I I hear the heart of that frustration from cursed and says\nWe get a limited choice it's shaped by gerrymandering and a lot of other forces that\nWe can we feel like we can't control we elect somebody\nThey go to Washington or they go to the state capital and then they're open to all of the the interests you know some of which Kirsten might agree with right and uh we have there is no accountability ... what would you say about that\nBut there is accountability [laughter] and you know and this is with us so this is one of the things that I've seen really come to the fore since the twenty sixteen election um congressmen\nAnd women and senators would hold these town halls and like the the regular five people would show up [laughter] but ooh remember when Congress was going after the Affordable\nAct yeah yes is it all\nAre packed people are calling into their their their representatives offices\nLaying out what the consequences will be for not adhering to to to um ensuring the wellbeing of their constituents and you saw Congressman Ellison going like you know I'm here I I don't think I'm going to be having a town hall [laughter]\nOh well you know that kind of civic engagement because part of what we have to understand that\nOur engagement does not stop when we when we um cast a ballot ... that's when our engagement begins actually our gauge may begins before then but it it's like we think that once we vote then we're done until the next election went\nAnd it's this moment in between where yes they may be hearing from the lobbyist but they're also hearing from\nUs and that is where we will make the difference one\nOf the guests in the series is an ... and she's out with a new book about hope and I I Wonder if this sentence from the prelude what

I think that the sort of what I think Jason I call the older kind of conservative judicial position which is that the constitution says nothing about abortion and indeed it doesn't end up in any explicit\nWay um and so that that was a that roe versus Wade was a a an assertion of judicial power an overreach the court should be more humble\nUm that's you know that's in some tension with the what he described the kind of more libertarian or\nA newer thinking in the in the federalist society and and so then it then it comes down to well you know what\nIf you are going to be a bit more active as a judge and strike down more laws the question is which areas are you going to do that in and we have a ... a disagreement to certainly on the court between the more liberal justices who would focus their\nIn validation on a discriminatory laws a criminal criminal procedure positions on criminal defendants and the more conservative justices who seem more willing to at least a couple of them might be more willing to take on economic regulation and administrative regulation and the name of a more conservative\nView so um you know that the judges suggestion to have a super majority was a reflection of the the older a judicial restraint position\nAttractive to liberals when they see the the court going the other way uh but uh liberals I I think the ... and I think they often end up coming back to rely on the court has said counter majority\nArea and means on protecting minority rights\nIt Jason are there specific issues where as you were researching this change in perspective and the federalist society they you think are ripe for you know seeing that scene that emerge in these new justices yeah\nOh I didn't get anything having to do with government regulation of economics at business I think will be an area um I mean it was interesting during both the the cabin on the Gorsuch hearings before\nThe the first round of the out here I thought the second but there was a lot of attention paid by a liberal activist Democratic senators to abortion social issues like that and I think that\nUm you know the conservative justices nominees\nTend to ... tried to hide the ball there are a little bit they you know they talk about respect precedent their opinions but when it comes to questions of economic regulation business regulation they're they're quite explicit um in terms of wanting to uh you know go to war with the administrative state or at least rain in the industry to state and I think ah that that's an area where\nUm there are there I think you'll see\nSome move but I think uh that's that's an area where there could be a number of five four decisions are and and the conservatives fate or a favor\n... call here from bill in Roseville, Minnesota Hi Bill thanks for waiting\nLook area I've just I've been reading where I'm part of the problem with the Supreme Court on much lost so much respect is is the weakness of Congress they just aren't willing to do their job so they dumped a lot of social issues on the Supreme Court but they're never meant to deal with\nSo they why they have such bad ...\nBad approval ratings and and Congress is just very very weak you know\nJason is there something to that\nOh yeah definitely I mean Congress has become you know\nIt it's not very effectively functioning legislative body at this point and ah you know it's not so much that it goes it's gridlock and they can't get anything done that increasingly all of our our political disputes which you know you would hope would be settled at the ballot box are now being result of the courts and uh\nI think that's something else that contributes to the that's the view of the court's these days\nYeah I have to say we mentioned immigration a minute ago that's a prime example of that right how long does Congress been trying to pass some kind of an immigration reform and now we've got these issues that are flowing out of\nA Trump policy headed for the court can you think of is another issue Thomas where Congress has basically not done anything to 'em reform it or work on it and it it heads to the court you're looking at me with ...\nSays oh let me so I mean I think that definitely happens ah let me let me raise an issue that so that might seem a little bit obscure people but I'll Try to explain why it now and as we could be really one of the most important cases there aren't a lot of big a big uh so\nObviously controversial cases on the docket right now but there is a case that actually has to do with a sex offender registration a and the question is who decides whether somebody who's a sex offender if they have to register\nWhen they were convicted before the effective date of the federal statute that requires registering and Congress did not address what to do with those people it's punted on it and it punted it to the attorney general [noise]\nUm so the question here\nWe should all lawyers called the delegation doctrine or the non delegation doctrine which says Congress can't just punt the ball completely to the administrative agencies you have to set up some kind of a standard which is basically to do here\nCongress does that a lot in the administrative state partly because issues are really hard to resolve and partly because Congress doesn't want to take the heat yeah and\nUm so this is a case that's a kind of a civil rights case about sex offenders but the implications are much broader if the court says Congress has to start giving more of a detailed standard to guide agents agencies that could have effect across the whole range of ...\nAnd if they're gridlock now can you imagine what comes out of that right [noise] less\nLead they do a show I mean and you know to the better I think there is any of the the counter side to that is do you really want Congress setting these [noise] how how into the weeds due on Congress to go I mean why didn't you know the right if this is\nWhat strict at NPR Twin

fueling our economy\nIt's the delivery drivers who bring Amazon's packages to your door and other people and the gig economy which happens to be one of the biggest growing segments in our economy\nThey don't have health insurance and their only option for health care is to either across their fingers or show up in the ER\nWe're lagging way behind comparable countries we lagged behind and other measures you've heard the other debaters talk about this costs quality an access in fact we actually spend twice as much in this country and we get half the results\nIf you want to address cost quality and access for all than retail is not enough\nWe spend Eighteen percent of our GDP on healthcare other countries spent ten percent\nIf you go to CBS they can provide you with some convenience and that's great but that's not actually addressing the major costs drivers in our system if we look at quality measures\nThings like hospital admissions from preventable disease or life expectancy we lagged behind other countries it's frankly kind of embarrassing to improve the quality measures we really need to invest\nOutside of health care and to the social determinants of health\nRetail alliances are for profit they leave people out and they don't have the scale of retailers bottom line is really not societies bottom line\nThey are not oriented towards doing the common good they need paying customers they take a short term view they have to their priority as their shareholders not what's good for society if you're a low income Medicaid customer and you have a lot of different complex needs\nOr you're in the Amazon driver in between gigs retailers don't really see you as a money making opportunity if we turn to employers they insure less than half of our population\nDrive change is very small and when you look at the alliances like Amazon Berkshire Hathaway taping Morgan they only cover a tiny fraction a million\nIn fact it's government that has that scale government is playing an increasingly large role in the role of hair bows for Medicare and Medicaid and if we look at that silver tsunami that's coming at us that's only going to grow\nRetail alliances are not enough Washington actually has to be part of the solution when you look at the health care industry is unique it's actually full of market failures like monopolies short term incentives all kinds of things that the private sector won't solve on its own we need Washington at the table\nWe have to have retail employers they are necessary but they're not sufficient\nOther developed nations have actually made that\nThey provide overwhelming proof that this can happen we don't need scattershot solutions\nWe need a better functioning system\n[noise] and I\nWant to hurt us debate where a resolution\nIs retail alliances not Washington will save us health care system now we move on to round to end and round to the debaters address when another directly they also take questions for me\nAnd from you our audience here at the Mayo transform conference or the resolution again returned alliances not Washington will save the U.S health care system\nWe have to debaters arguing in support of this motion ... and Greg Slager arguing that Washington is broken that the u._s. and too many categories is last last last with the government does not know how to surf consumers\nThat the retailers know how to scale that they have multiple ways to reach not just their employees but also their customers they asked rhetorically the question who really has the incentive to fix the problem and to reward the best service and do so with transparency and their answer to that\nSo it's on the retail sector the team arguing against the motion at least ... and Rosemary day there say they are not arguing that Washington is the sole solution but they are definitely saying they're going to a clinic such as Wal Mart's may be convenient but it's just not the same thing as going to the doctor they questioned the motives of these retailers\nThey say that they cannot scale the kind of health care that needs to be delivered system why does not just primary care but really the big big problems and they don't see these companies getting interested in that\nA lot of area of disagreement and I want to work through some of it but I Want to start to you Greg Slater you're both of your opponents argued that retail companies ultimate loyalty is to shareholders not to the health of their employees or the health of their customers is just the fact of life\nGives to lie to the whole notion that we should be trusting them to take on this job\nWhat's your response to that first off I think that if you're lowering your health care costs for employers so you can buy more goods\nShe called the junk there's a big portion of America that doesn't think it's junk and its survival for them I think that that's important because what you've done as you gave them choice you reduce health care costs which is not a choice and you gave them choice CBS\nTook cigarettes out of their store two billion dollars in sales\nGone overnight because they want to be viewed as a health provider they are building trust they're becoming more mission based not sick care this is health care this is helping them live healthier lives to this is helping them with nutrition this is keeping them ... those are the big problems I mean you look at\nDiabetes and heart ... actually I mean there have you've made it quite a few points I just want your opponents response than what you're saying is mountain\nCosts I mean when you talk about employers asserting control I Am all for\nIt but when you get right down to at large\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio

I live here in Rochester I function as an emergency doc my question is what you think the government and retailers could do for the homeless and others who currently are being underserved what about the homeless people\nWhich I Would like to go first from the J or\nI'd like to hear from them yet\nWe totally agree the government has a role in here too and I think one place where we fill in this country that other countries do a much better job of is in our social networks and creating those safety nets the government and retail should work together and figure something out like that but I really do think that social terror is really something that we really need to invest in\nI work as a physician I used to work and homeless clinics in San Francisco a city that is played by a significant homeless problem Medicare and Medicaid are great negotiators but you know if I'm running a homeless clinic which I've done in the past\nWhat do I prefer to pay Medicare and Medicaid prices for a band aid and Tylenol or what I prefer to pay Amazon prices\nThe changing the distribution that we can have is going to be meaningful and it's going to allow us to provide better care for the poor\nAnd it's going to free us up to expand Medicaid government has a very important role to play in the future of our system our point as a government isn't going to save our system but rather retailers\nAn employer alliances in our drive costs down and the homeless will benefit from that as well the weakest of all Americans from the other side response to that question so\nI read that they're still gonna be the forgotten people until they actually have some money to put on the table\nGovernment needs to play that role to not forget about the ... folks who are homeless and our country does very poorly relative to others in terms of our investment in social services so that's something that we have to have the collective well to do retailers can partner in that I think they're innovative programs\nLike the idea of a trickle down health care benefits\nGoing to lower costs and will make its way nobody made that argument\nWhat I like to get every person that he was a federally qualified health center which prides fantastic primary care and mental health benefit to a lot of American\n\nIf you could tell us her name to\nThank you my name is Spencer merchant from Minneapolis, Minnesota I worked for the insurance side how are the retail agency is going to transform clinical care who spoke and mostly about price points and negotiation and\nWhat does this future really look like nuts and bolts sense yeah a great deal to take that\nIt's going to involve the more money is going into consulting rooms and expanding the care facilities and these large retailers some of these entities I mean there are food deserts and there are a pharmacy deserts too but some of these retailers they're effectively the community centers they know all the people in the neighborhood they come in\nWal Mart has a hundred and fifty million visitors to their stores every ... you know the engagement that they have with the folks in their community and I think it's going to help them\nIn terms of preventable care I think the health care as opposed to secure I think it's going to stop ER admissions to they've got a built in advantages I mean because people are going there that they got the convenience they got the access there also subsidize as I mentioned I mean their buildings are subsidized so it can continue to Dr Laura ... throughout the continue\nTo get the other side to respond on that plane and the reason in my own reporting around the country there are parts of the country I now go to where\nThe downtown small downtown is gone because Wal Mart came to town but you know at Walmart replaced at Wal Mart is the village square there is a sense of community there and so your opponents are arguing that that sense of community has a real tangible positive thing to be taken into account in this debate I just wanted to see what your responses to that\nSo it's hard for me to get by their Walmart really is creating a sense of community compared to like that mom and pop climate\nYou know maybe in some spots that's true but I really see Wal Mart has a pretty big corporations cycling millions of people through its doors every day I'm hard pressed to see a true community there unlike\nWhat we talk about with a federally qualified health center or a doctor who has a long term relationship with their patients so I Do think it's different\nI Want to go to a question here Hi I'm ... Barton I'm from the University of Wisconsin Madison and we've spoken a little bit about how you need money to access the system as it exists today but what about the incentive that retail has to actually\nCreate a future where you then have money to participate in retail in a way that I went to\nA foot or you're seeing that dynamic as an argument to support the foresight or as a challenge to the far side for both sides okay okay well let's take the reason I asked the question is I thought I actually heard that's the only reason that Walmart is interested in bringing down health care costs so that you would have more money to spend on\nOther products and Wal Mart you you didn't actually argue whether that's a good thing or a bad thing but a phenomena but I Want to take it to the other side first\nThe dynamic of these retailers I think having a motive or or just an effective putting more spending money in people's pockets because their health care costs have gone to\nThis I mentioned I think that's a good thing because what you've done as you move\nSomething that was not by choice to something that is by choice something that's a burden to something that's an opportunity to think about those families in what they need to know their life do they need to pay more for health care or more for other than the food and the subsidies to help the social determinants of health the other impacts on health outside of just visiting the health system\nSo he's not a bad thing if they drive down the cost and you can buy more stuff at Wal Mart was ...\nThere's two points first being okay they might free up a little bit of disposable income by changing how are you by a drunk or get ...\nA fantastic thing but if they're really going to transform the system you're going to have to trust a retailer to partner with you on something like cancer care\nAre you ready for that are you going to do like Walmart telling you where you have to go to get your chemotherapy\nI Would also did not go directly to retail is the only solution that can free at more of our disposable income from health care um it may not be minus the theory political stance that a lot of people are arguing that Medicare for all would do that for the average American so I think there are myriad ways we can get there\nOkay I Would love to continue with the question answers section but we're out of time that concludes round two of this intelligence squared us debates where\nOur resolution is retail alliances\nWill save us health care system and now we move\nOn to round three where each of the debaters makes a closing statement first Greg Slater senior partner and global health transaction leader\nAnd young is a follow on to that question actually so I mean I just want you to imagine everybody knows and Irene Irene is fifty six years old she lives with her husband she's on fixed income she's got diabetes\nAnd she's struggling with high blood pressure she goes to a retailer once or twice a week with her husband to buy products that she typically buys that the retailer no suicide intimate relationship an engagement and through using data analytics\nWhile she's in she goes to the pharmacy she reveals a script she bought some influence strips\nShe stops to get her blood pressure tested to compare it to her home result she's got one at home and since been spiking a bit so she goes into Walmart for free she gets her her blood pressure taken it's hot so she stopped by the clinic to get some questions answered and what they do is they put her on a pillow health monitored with a doctor who\nWho asked her about what's going on any other kind of things in her life that might be causing these things and then gives her new prescriptions so she goes and she passed\nStart your
