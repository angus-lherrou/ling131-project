winningest coach and college football history\n... grew up in Colorado and became a player coach for his high school football team after the head coach left to serve in World War two\nIn in Nineteen Ninety nine interview with NPR he said that many of his unorthodox ideas about coaching came about because he started out as a peer to the other players\nYou know a lot to lose the coaches head or people at I suppose one of them believe it or not you're not supposed to drink water when you play in school or any athlete so and I took over that was the first thing we will get tired viruses less

cloud times for thirty three years and now works for St john's the land talk to NPR's Andrew Krieger about ... legacy\nFairly early in his college coaching career at St john's he gathered the team around him at a practice and he pulled a quarter out of his pocket on a sunny day any kind of help the quarter out in front of the sun and he said to his players say this quarter is football\nSon has

Saturday and ah you know you can't count how many concussions he probably saved over the years just from just from that one simple thing alone\nWas gonna ask that those unorthodox approach is um he just didn't feel constrained by you know the the tradition in the system he just felt like he was free to\nBest marks of a of a of a good coach is that it's not like they try to mold their talent to a system it's like he'll take a look at the talent that he has and make vascular system I mean he won national titles with teams that Randall all the time never threw it he won his last national titled with the team through it all over the place\nYou know he molded his system to the Taliban had available\nThey certainly were chances for him to leave over the years why do you think he stayed around\n[noise] he did have some opportunities they looked at very carefully in the eighties he very new took a job at least by the San Diego state I Believe he was approached by the Vikings at one

gets where I grew up and he was really good understanding when someone had told him a remarkable thing so he would come home talking about\nGiven up a trumpet lesson to he was a band director for many years and they'll say guess\nAnd you had a way of making things exciting to me mom and dad both told stories\nTo me before bedtime when I Would go to bed and I would get a story from each of them and mom would always come in and talk about you know something that would be put me to sleep such as the butterflies um she would talk about\nThings that were sort of cozy and nice but I couldn't wait for

sort of shake off at kind of adventure\nDo you remember what the first sentence of Treasure Island and it's one of the best opening sentence I don't remember the last I guess what I happened to have

but the bearings of the island and that only because there is still treasure\nTo not yet lifted I take up my pen in the year of grace Seventeen and go back to the time when my father kept the admiral

I was transcribing that sends I thought could any I didn't know how old you are when you first heard this but could any kids' attention\nYou know survive through that as exciting as it is survived through an opening sentence like that that's a ... or ... well I didn't remember right\nBut you were captured I was I'm sure\nYou know I mean uh it's such a great story and Stevenson if you read them now is is fascinating because he was writing in the Eighteen nineties um but he was ahead of his time his writing despite that first sentence who's writing is is remarkably modern if you compare him with some of his contemporaries\nUm wow Cooper doesn't really hold up that well I mean he told great stories but his language was a really for both since Lowery and and he was he was very worried about getting all those adjectives and there he really was and and he got them all into nothing was going to keep that [noise]\nUm but if you read Stephen ... it is about the the tail and the character development and hands on the economy was words that's that's pretty marvelous [noise]\nUh I I don't know as has anybody um ended up with the Mark Twain I'm a autobiography that has been published since he was dead for a hundred years\nOr ... I don't know I don't think that reading big doorstep of a book and it's his autobiography that he specified not be published until they'd been gone for a hundred years because\nThere were I Can't believe you don't remember this it was a huge deal with it was published a few years ago a Robin gave it to me and I I've been I've been sort of working my way through it dipping in here and there\nAnd\nThe way to read that book because it's not linear and and so it's it's very difficult to just start at the beginning you go back to the index everything is cross indexed so if you want to read it whether it had an interaction with with Robert Louis Stevenson for example you look in the index and their Stevens' name\nAnd so I learned that that one day and I don't remember the year uh Steve it's happened to be traveling through New York and he got a hold of twin and Stephenson and Mark Twain sat on a park bench in Central Park New York now for an hour and a half and talked about literature [noise]\nUh what would you give it to be you know a kid flying a ... next to that park bench did Mark Twain recount the details of the conversation he did a ... and they had kind of an interesting conversation um which I Will not recount here because I'll do it wrong [laughter] um but I imagine that if you uh find the book it\nProbably find out exactly what Mark Twain said about that meeting fascinating stuff\nSo let's say that Virgil wander had gone off to your editor Elizabeth who's here tonight yeah and it had a\nRun on run on run on first sentence [laughter] I've asked

thinking why don't we get a ... why why can't writers get away with that\nIt was worth seeing but when I stood when Elizabeth first saw this manuscript it was a hundred and fifty pages longer than it is no oh how\nInteresting so a new meaning okay meaning what what did you feel should be in it and then we'll talk about what is and\nWell if you knew where you realize that the last thing she ever does ah I thought wow fantastic [noise] um it it seemed like a change for the better and and I appropriately some of that for for my my projection of ...\nI mean also think about ruined he's figuring

meant to be raised by a father who was either larger ... larger than life or domineering in the family or someone that the town the community told stories about\nAnd you flip that\nRight ruined arrives and he starts to hear the stories of the son who is gone\nYeah because as soon as it was kind of a local legend right he was a he's a little piece of pathology\nHe was um a minor league pitcher for the ... superior Dukes of the Northern League [noise] um and he had one perfect game one perfect game in Nineteen Ninety four\nWhich was the last year that the actual due to produce superior Dukes were in existence before they really has a city we we used to take the boys when they were small and drive over from our house in Crosby and go to wage stadium\nAnd watch the the Dukes which was fun there were never more than you know a hundred and fifty or two hundred\nBut the baseball was good the fog would roll in off the lake and it was wonderful just to you know dollar hot dogs and a sort of crazy a sailors off the Italian grand ships in the harbor drew really really a great scene I don't know if anybody here went and saw the Dukes but they were fun\nAnd so really I needed to write a character like that imagine imagine having\nOne game where you're fastball which has always been fast it's just that you could never control it before suddenly it goes exactly where you

and they're passionate about it and [noise] and then you sit down and you know we've all these and two or three and a half minute piece yeah I Do miss of course I miss\nI mean that that's the I think that's really the incredible privilege of journalism which gets a bad rap these days but think about it think about how people invite journalists into their lives in their homes and their experiences

there is nothing better than when someone is really on it and um and they're telling you what their most care about yeah that's that's magic\nSo was that training in some way for for what would follow oh\nYeah absolutely it was the best training in the world because [noise]\nBecause you meet so many different but you know you get sent out by your editors to to go chase a story and um and sometimes it's a story that that has a deadline and ... and it involves a political moment or a hot issue and and that's okay but that's never when I was\nUh interested in really I mean I was I was interested

[noise]\nAh because look for an introvert that's not the easiest thing to do um you know I I I used to just be frozen for thirty minutes before I could pick up the phone and try to really oh yeah absolutely\nUm but then I'd be in the car I'd be driving there I'd be nervous about it you know or they're going to be my shy or is it going to be ... or they\nAre they're not going to like me I mean you know how it is and um and then I Would get there and when I found it or what if you know I kinda interview this person that I Know on a very visceral level I maybe not going to like\n[noise] uh and then I'd get there I talked to him for five minutes and it's like oh I'm totally on your side I mean I was just a chameleon I'm\n[laughter]\nHelpful because it gets people to talk but uh but essentially what I learned is that if you talk if you listen to somebody for five minutes which is more important than talking to them for five\nI'm almost all the time you kind of like them and that helped with writing characters because I I have just never um I've never written a character I didn't really like I like them all\nEven the ... especially the bad ones I really like um [noise] um they're they're interesting and they've they've got something going on um people have something going on a really interesting and and likable you almost\nOh is that most of the time\nI think you used an important word there to listening which is less and less of a practice art\nDo you think so yeah oh yeah yeah um I think\nIt's I think we live in kind of a culture that says a search what you think

Jerry Miller this is NPR News this hour what white kids and their parents say and believe about race sociologist Margaret Hagerman spent two years listening as white middle schoolers talked about race\nWhy they're black school mates were picked on by the teacher why no one like the only two black girls in their school why it hurt to be called a racist she also talked and listen to their parents and that was a high opening to\nThe result is a new book that explores how kids come to their understanding about race how their schools and sports and interactions with their parents shape that understanding\nProfessor Hagerman writes in the introduction\nHow light a fluent children make sense of race not only reflects but also reproduces and reinforces the existing racial order\nAs Maggie Hagerman joined us I Know we both like to hear from parents and the audience this morning are you aware\nSo that your pre teen kids have about race what happened the last\nTime you talk directly about racial divisions with your kids are those conversations you ever have\nSo as we begin the discussion parents I'd like to hear from you this morning how well where are you of the interactions and the opinions that your middle school age or pre teen kids have about race and racial bias what happens when you bring it up do you ever talk directly to your kids about it\nHere's the phone number six five one to two seven six thousand eight hundred two for two twenty eight twenty eight wherever you are in our five state region and if you're\nHanging out with me on Twitter at carry K. E. R. R. I. NPR Margaret Hagerman is a sociologist at the University of Mississippi the new book is titled white kids growing up with privilege in a racially divided America\nAnd she's with us today from ... Mississippi and Maggie welcome we've rescheduled this a couple of times I'm so glad you were patient with us and we can get this get this going so thank you for being with us still thank you for having me\nIf I was about ... if I was to deconstruct that quote that I took from your introduction it sounds to me like you're saying that unless we're more cognizant of how the next generation of white Americans are understanding race\nThe divisions that we see today are going to continue ... what would you add to that\nWell I think that's a great way to put it on and yeah I think that the ideas that support system and I'm a sociologist I'm very interested in sort of thinking about our society as a system\nHow those systems stay in place you know the idea of support those systems and so my research is really trying to explore how ideas about race form in our newest generation of young white people\nDiscussion to understand here is not\nOh you know these kids were constantly spouting out racist ideas and epithets and that kind of thing and their parents were appalled that it's nowhere near as overt as that it's the signals and\nWell it it's funny actually reminds me of one of the children in my study who sort of had the same comment and he was going to a private school for middle school and he was very concerned about the fact that the only other kids at a school for the most part we're also white and we're also you know quite affluent\nAnd he actually you know it sort of talked to his parents about this and was like you know why can't I go to the public school you know I I don't think that this\nYou know school is really teaching me all the things that I Want to learn you know I Want to learn about different people interacting across different you know social divisions all this and so um you know he was certainly um I think unusual from the sample but um I Do think that sort of some of the some of the things that\nAnd when he was just saying you know certainly relate to that child's experience and that desire to be in spaces that\nAre beyond just to sort of you know ... white privilege community\nIt Maggie ... was that a Greg and Conor Greg the parent Connor the the sun because I think Conor he's got a somewhat advanced understanding\nAbout race and racial bias and Greg the parent is kind of saying I Know we could do more I'm you know in some ways I'm kind of figuring this out in real time and I'm I'm open to what Congress bringing back is is that the the father and son you're talking about\nIt's actually a different kid but yes there and there's some similar dynamics there too and yeah so the the thing was Connor if the economy has always gone to public schools and his parents purposely chose to live kind of like some of the other callers and and people on Twitter mentioned you know purposely chose to send their children to I'm an ...\nBut even in that family you know that God is talking very openly with with Connery in front of me about how even still you know on there's work to be done and and there's problems even the ... and that public school especially in high school with tracking and\nYou know the ways in which white children are are white teenagers are put into the honors and AP classes and the black kids or not you know so um I I think that there's someone mentioned recently that just called in I think maybe you were reading it that you know the worked as an end you know that that people still have to keep trying and and I think that that's true just sending their kids to integrated school is not going to\nNecessarily mean you know your work the work is done\nA a call here from Alex in Minneapolis hey Alex how does this work in your household\nGoods yeah we're in a white affluent households on the east ...\nMhm and\nOur school district just by default is a very integrated school it's about a third Somali if there's been no third wife and at first I was a little nervous about it I thought you're going to be like a\nChoking child and maybe one of those classrooms [noise] I'm Sorry I'm a little nervous [laughter] that's okay [laughter] and go\nBut really the more it's gone on as an eight year old has agreed on them in a four year old and high five mhm\nAnd it really seems like [noise] the more you see people as people as individuals as regular people then it's harder to\nWrite a whole group says other than that and I think getting daily exposures has been really nice\n[noise] so do you talk to your to your son or about ... ... what's it like to be one of perhaps one of the few were white kids in the class I mean how director the discussions you're having about this experience that he's having every day\nI mean it hasn't really come up too much but recently I had to talk to them about the whole black lab better movement uh-huh\nKnow good and I thought well this is pretty healthy but I talked to him about it and I talked to them about you know the history of the the privilege what he does have and he's going to be kind of distressed [noise] um you know by all these ... and I think that was good I mean it's obviously something you thought about and then later I\nActually heard them talking to some friends about it like you know that if you're darker skin was you know the police can eat it you know what I thought that was kind of cool\nYeah Alex I'm really glad you called you got over the nerves they're a little bit good to hear the experience\nMaggie I'm One of the things that you say that parents can do is find the language to talk about this within the household and and I hear Alex saying it doesn't come up that much\nAdvice for him perhaps on how to bring it up or is that not necessary given what what's going on there with his his son\nWell I think what's really great actually about Alex is example um is that his child asked him a question about seeing you know the black lives matter science\nAnd then he engaged in it and the thoughtful conversation and dialogue with his son um and that's actually in I think in in my experience leases my research unusual because typically what we see is it's in the aftermath of a racist hate crime or something that suddenly there's this call for people to talk to their white kids about race and actually think that\nOn you know a better a better strategy would be to have\nYou know everyday kinds of conversations about race when when it when things happen you know when things come up just sort of an everyday life like noticing a sign on as opposed to waiting until there is a moment of crisis and then not having any foundational you know work in place so that then then the child is really sort of confused or overwhelm so\nAnd I also think it's really important to note that while parents you know who are white might feel like it's like stressful or it's difficult to find the right words to talk about race with their children\nRight that they're meanwhile there are families who are raising you know African American children and children who are in recent immigrants and so forth who had who ... who feel they have to have these conversations with their kids so I guess I just want to encourage Alex and I and everything that he thought I think is really is really great\nAh from Twitter here we discuss race but our choices speak louder than words we chose Spanish immersion for our kids put our son in a neighborhood school\nThat is thirty percent white make sure that we see movies like hidden figures in the majority of our books feature minority leads my three year old granddaughter Sarah was talking about the mean black girls\nTurns out the main girl characters and purple Alicia is where black clothing\nTroubling and to the phones here to Wesleyan Rochester hey Wesley Hi thanks for waiting\nOh thank you what's your experience with us\nSo I'm not ... I'm hustling lights um individuals who we regard to the children from foster care you're Rochester or both of the African American send ... and I can attest to\nGood white privilege or something that we don't even think about as white ... until you know it's forced on every single did you have to talk to my kids about these days and I'm just\nShocked how much I have to discuss with them on a regular basis just to feel like a ... cities\nCan you give me an example of the last time you you felt like you had to have a conversation with your kids about it the kind of what happened\nWere put your wrists with them with regard to Congress raises the question we always answer ... of course is the way we are to those as well until they start asking questions but you know when it comes out um why was this\n[noise] ... um you know we we can talk about um the Glen I'm an old is going to leave lose ... ... ... you\nKnow mega curious about what you would you here with with what Wesley and his wife are having to say to their kids yeah\nI mean this is the reality for people raising children of color and particularly black kids in America I mean\nUm there's there's actually some really great scholarship I'm On this topic in and sort of survey research with parents as well as from our interview based projects on\nTheir you know certainly there are some really powerful um data about how um how parents were talking to their kids particularly black children about um the death of Trayvon Martin murder murder of Trayvon Martin I'm the murder of Michael Brown I mean there's there's some research you know sometimes I researched takes a minute to catch up with what's happening on\nIn the news but certainly we know that there's a scholarship that's documenting exactly some of the dynamics that that he was just mentioning\nUh I'm remembering the discussions I think you had with Holly or which which were pretty instructive she's a parent one of the families that you talked to in researching the book and you ask her if she and her husband talk about the fact that their child's school is so white and she says this to you\nKnow we don't talk about it it's you know it's a non issue for us I Would welcome more people of color but I just want everyone who is here to be on the same page as all the parents like me\nAs a sociologist what are you picking up there\nSo as a sociologist I'm picking up that she's really talking in racially coded language you saying that she doesn't she doesn't mind as you know black people from the city moved to the suburb where she lives um she's not using that language exactly but\nValue education and the the insinuation there is that black people don't value education and certainly that is not true in fact\nThere's um you know a generous amount of infer of of um research that shows that actually parents who are raising black children\nMay even in some studies care more about at their child's education and give their children and tools to navigate and not only their school but also raises another school and that's you know and that's another way to measure the ways that parents black parents are caring about their children\nWhat do you think's going on there well certainly I found a similar pattern in my research and in fact one of the things that they did to try to make kids still more comfortable talking about race um was to show them different pictures of celebrities and to use that as a strategy to get them you know just to sort of you know tell me who your favorite celebrities and then I Would ask\nCan you tell me what you know raise these different celebrities are and again I was just using it as a way to sort of you know warm up you know get the kids feeling comfortable but um I Do some of the children actually said no I don't I Can't I don't want to tell you what raise these people are because that's racist like talking about the money is race is racist\nAnd that was the message that they were being you know sort of taught by their families and their schools\nAnd that any discussion of race is racist and therefore we don't talk about it um and certainly there was even a school actually that on how to rule that if you used the word racist as an insult or even even talked about racism racism\nThat that was breaking schools' rules and I asked a little girl who told me that's like well what happens if someone at your school is like actually doing something that you think is racist\nAnd she's like oh well that would never happen at our school because people aren't racist that our school [laughter]\nAs I was like they literally didn't even have the language they weren't allowed to use the language to even identify racism let alone have a more meaningful conversation like the ...\nI I also I'm kinda concluded from the conversations you're having with parents for the book that\nParents have some pretty shallow discussions about this where they say things like\nWell it's about a exposing my children to different foods are different music ... you know kinda nibbling around the edges\nOf a more direct discussion about race and you say however well meaning parents maybe when they fail to acknowledge inequality and racism in a way they are unintentionally complicit in the reproduction of it\nI thought the of course those parents would be appalled by the idea of that but\nBut what are you saying\nSo so you gotta have three different groups of of family is in this study and this is families that fit into this category are families that said that they really value diversity they say that they care about multiculturalism\nBut then they make decisions like sending their kids to private school or sending their kids to public school but then advocating for them to be in certain classrooms that are predominantly white\nAnd so for these parents their understanding of you know raising race conscious children is about celebrating diversity and celebrating multiculturalism and like you said you know going to festivals or there's different foods from across the world and sort of celebrating different um practices and and languages and while that's all wonderful\nYou know that's not addressing power and privilege inequality and oppression and history and white supremacy and all these things that\nUm you know I think based on my research are actually you know topics that that that really can help children think more critically about race and racism I'm from a position of structural privilege and so on you know scholars talk about this Joyce ... one of my colleagues talks a lot about diversity discourse\nAnd there's this concept of shallow multiculturalism you know that\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

R. go dot com\nGet ahead and that our children's lives will be better than our own\nThere's always been a gap between rich and poor now intention between a broadly based democracy and the power of wealthy elites today that gap as as big as it's ever been and it's helped corrode faith in our basic institutions and belief in democratic solutions\nBut we've been here before in the Eighteen nineties the progressive movement a rose to challenge the power of the trust some the robber barons and in the Nineteen thirties amidst the despair of the great depression the new deal transformed the role of government and restored faith in democracy\nLater in the program we'll talk with political historian Lawrence Jake and it's from the University of Minnesota about how and why inequality expanded in late twentieth century and how that eats away at our institutions and we'll talk about what we learn from history and about democratic solutions but\nWe begin with Robert Dallek whose latest presidential biography is Franklin Delano Roosevelt a political life\nRobert Dallek joins us from his home in Washington DC welcome to the democracy test like you and good to be with you and I want to begin with a quote from Europe prologue which is titled everything to fear you set the date march fourth Nineteen thirty three quote\nThe weeks leading up to Franklin Roosevelt induction into the White House where a nightmare as an unprecedented economic collapse it quieted the cheerleading about America's future that\nBusiness leaders in the press and politicians had made a hallmark of the Nineteen twenties optimism was in short supply voices of despair crowded out the promise of American Life\nIn January Ninety thirty three Calvin Coolidge the retired Republican president said in other periods of depression\nSome things that were solid and upon which you could base hope but as I look about I now see nothing to give ground for hope nothing of math\nYou go on Herbert Hoover on his last day as president says we're in a pitiful position we are at the end of our strength and Robert Dallek is it fair to say that many were ready to pronounce American democracy offend ya\nWell they were and in fact what you have to remember all of us have to remember\nIs that this was a time when fascism in Italy\nNot Susan in Germany and communism and Russia were competing for those Kennedy later put his hearts and minds are those the feeling that democracy had reached its at\nThe end of the line and that these other ideologies these although it's just the government of one more appealing and of course that was the challenge for Franklin Roosevelt to address\nCould he a recreate faith than hope in a a a democratic institutions\nAnd a Roosevelt was not going to breach that he didn't want to rush into anything that would cost him a populist support indeed in Nineteen forty one\nThe British ambassador pressed rose about to go to Congress and ask for a declaration of war heroes we'll set I could do it and I can get a job\nAt off first setbacks and the fighting or lose that consensus\nAnd uh he saw that as impermissible and so that was an act of great political shrimp ... on his part\nBecause of course in that sense Pearl Harbor was a godsend to unite the country and bring it into the war as they are a solid feelings of a support\nWell that does beg the question now how did he hold on to popular support when his critics on the right we're calling him a dictator and a communist and of course his policy did know succeed after some recovery early on FDR cut back on spending and there was another profound slump in the economy how do you read about managed to keep Americans behind him\nWell in fact if they had not in World War two if the warhead bumped broken out Nineteen thirty nine\nI don't think Roosevelt would have been able to win a third term because in his second term when as you just described the country\nHad that recession and Roosevelt Nineteen thirty eight\nTried to defeat conservatives and the Democratic party in the primary elections specially across the south and he uh the fell short in\nAll but one instance in fighting the conservatives in his party and I don't think he ever could have gotten the nomination again and certainly not the winner third term\nSo it was a war that really in a sense gave him a second opportunity\nAnd the country rallied around him and of course the fact that we ended up winning the war brings him down to rush through history as one of the three great presidents of American history you said earlier that ruse\n... and did the effort or your biography does not shy away from Franklin Roosevelt to mistakes or from his failure to take in Jewish refugees are from his failure to address racial issues more forcefully\nHis decision to turn Japanese Americans in the second World War given all of that and more you still argue that his legacy is one of greatness\nWell it is because he was a brilliant leader in that he used radio to reach people in the grassroots so to speak\nAnd if you look at the polling data throughout his presidency at least in the Gallup polls he'd never went below fifty percent and see what a contrast that is to the current incumbent who was never achieved fifty percent\nHis going on two years in the White House you see now it speaks to Roosevelt ... ... as a politician and\nYes there were stumbles shortcomings they were limitations but again he reflected the public mood in the country when you know he didn't press the case energetically to rescue Jewish knowledge cost\nHe was reflecting the mood in the country\nWhich was very much anti immigration there was a lot of feeling that at the end of the war the country was going to get back into a recession or depression and that bringing in\nLots of immigrants would add to the unemployment rolls and so Roosevelt was very reluctant to challenge that outlook that sentiment you said\nAnd also as late as Nineteen forty four people in the country we were asked if they believed that the Nazis\nConcentration camps and something like sixty percent of the poll said they didn't believe that they thought it was wartime propaganda from the British which had joined us into World War one and so they were very skeptical of that\nI'm going to go back to something you said before and use it to look forward\nYou alluded to the fact that FDR might well not want a third term and it was really World War two that pushed us into the creation of the liberal state the new deal state yes are you saying that we might not have had that state if it had not been for World War two\nWell it is certainly a loud Roosevelt preserve it\nBut I think that there were things that he had already put in place like Social Security you'll see an approval in Nineteen thirty five ... through the Wagner Act for a labor unions\nLegitimizing them and I don't think those would have disappeared because you see once you get things like Social Security and more recently Medicare or look how difficult it's been\nTo overturn the Affordable CARE Act that the President Obama put in place she\nWell here's the next question then behind that what a change how was American society how was American democracy different in Nineteen forty five than it had been in Nineteen thirty two what an FDR done or how would American Made such a profound change\nIt was it was a permanent change that this sort of notion that you were going to have some kind of ... involvement of the federal government\nIn the national economy in a providing a bedrock of support for people who uh\n... society that these had become accepted proposition ... of the society\nAnd that they're not going to be repealed you know Social Security and Medicare I don't think they're ever going to go way as long as we have a democracy in the Democratic voting with a small D\nIn this country because these are institutions that strike resident call ins with people you see the new deal humid lived the American industrial system\nAnd lots of things that Lyndon Johnson did added to that and the Affordable CARE Act\nObama added to that\nAnd so people don't want that to go away yes there is a certain conservative impulse in the country and they still have faced it a a self help in the notion of the\nPeople increasing their prosperity and having a better life that they have children these are still central propositions I think of American society and of the American ...\nSo I don't think this material will go away it was very much a change in the twentieth century than industrialized society could not continue to operate the way it had it a a nineteenth century economic I'm sort of culture and\nRobert Dallek thank you very much\nRobert ...

automobile production exploded America built the interstate highway system a housing boom created vast tracts of new homes in New suburbs that wants to norms gap between rich and poor shriveled\nIs a example of trial and error I don't think there is a kind of a magic play book there have been a variety of efforts geared to this ah I think the open primary and California is one that many of us are watching closely\nMixed there are suggestions about creating more of a kind of runoff system you've heard right choice voting as a possibility is being tried in Minnesota I think the main too you know and Maine and you know right choice voting intriguing idea and I think the results there are also a bit mixed\nAnd deserved further analysis I Do not think there's a magic bullet I think the most fundamental thing is to engage the majority of Americans when you have about half the country sitting out presidential elections\nAnd two thirds of the country are so sitting out midterm elections and even larger number sitting out local elections and then you've got the people in power making decisions that are really quite extreme\nThese are not the kind of Nineteen sixties or Nineteen seventies moderate politicians these are people once they're in power they're going for it\nAnd if they don't they know that they will be replaced then the next primary\nThe sense of moderation response them this responsibility to the majority of Americans has disappeared\nAmong our political elites those who are in office or are closely connected to the process that elects officials there's been a major break down and the norms and the behavior of our political leaders today it's about go as far as you can as fast as you can\nVersus the pattern before the Nineteen seventies which was a bit more cautious and emphasized building coalitions and finding where the majority of Americans were at least on salient top of the agenda issues\nWhich brings us back full circle to where we started which is your correlation of people's faith in the government with the Democratic process and that brings us\nPosted show the policies that would reduce inequality you you know higher minimum wage for example host show those are broadly popular but those have good norms difficulties getting enacted ... is that the result of this polarization of the political parties that using absolutely\nI think one of the biggest signs one of the most significant vital signs of a democracy\nIs whether those in office\nListen to what the majority prefer and America we're in a dangerous on again and again on the major policies\nFacing our country particularly those affecting the economic well being of Americans you find majorities of Americans supporting those policies whether it's health care reform minimum wage\nAnd others and then you find a political class in Washington and our state government that are on moved there don't seem to be motivated to respond to what most Americans prefer instead they couched how to the ideologically extreme\nActivist within their party they know if they don't follow the party line\nThat they will be replaced\nAnd that has become a tremendous corrupting influence\nThe path forward for beginning to address the deep end growing economic inequalities of America is well known we don't need to study for it the problem is that our political process is paralyzed\nAnd has been unable to respond to this transformation of our economy that is driving the upper classes even higher and stagnating are pushing down just about everybody else that America\nI'm actually an optimistic person by nature but I'm also someone who follows\nResearch and data and I find this moment in American politics to be very sobering this is a hard\nOn who studies politics and public policy to be optimistic we're really at each other's throats but here's something that I find interesting which is when you leave Washington or state capitals and you go out and you spend time with people in the country\nThere's some things that are developing that I find quite interesting I see a lot of energy\nParticularly among young people and folks who maybe have not been part of the political process I see a lot of communities coming together and looking for solutions because they know they can't trust Washington state capitals\nI'm also encouraged that even over these policies that are so polarized like health reform we see movement if you look carefully\nI've been doing a study with a colleague at Cornell University Suzanne Mettler and we've been tracking a group of Americans since twenty ten when they ... was passed\nAnd when we started it was what you'd expect our group of Americans representative of the country were very divided along party lines\nBut now they're moving into the eighth or ninth year of the four double CARE Act we're starting to see real movement\nWhere Republicans would favor repeal are now saying well maybe this is not such a bad idea let's see if we can improve it\nWe're starting to see greater support for some of the very concrete provisions like protections against preexisting condition exclusions or expanded Medicaid
