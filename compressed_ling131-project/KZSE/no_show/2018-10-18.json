one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up\nIn in the job market is adjust and aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways and that well I think the main thing that it that we see right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to\nBringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent\nOur spurts economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs do you get by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn\nKind of reversed course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that their lives to crunch\nGlad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel

manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U.S has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed overtime wheels\nArt increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and we're out and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months and we're really struggling with two items one is employed turnover wherever there\nAre chasing higher wages and and new facilities and new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your ... your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers

times\nEspecially within a the the African American community where we see in the in the guys and the public\nPresence of of Martin Luther king he's doing battle\nWithin his own ranks African Americans are becoming more impatient with uh the liberal approach to things um there there's a desire for more aggressive action\nAnd uh on the other hand even though Martin Luther king is feeling some of the frustration as well he represents a moderating sensibility so he's dealing with warring factions within his own caucus\nAnd I think a guy in the larger sense of the Democratic party is split between the more establishment group and the more liberal group\nAnd I'm a win win a party wins the election is largely as the President Johnson won in Nineteen sixty four I think it was the

coverage that we're bringing you leading up to the midterms become a contributor now and thank you\nFor all the focus on how the Democratic party shifting to the left nationally\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district\nIt is deeper ed and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat Ben McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear democratic Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump how do you view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump pressure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he's a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans had a Thirteen point advantage in this district the votes I Need\nTo win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican\nRace she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist\nGoing into Washington I Know exactly why I'm working with I build ... relationship on both sides of the aisle\nLove is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act she was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration\nAs a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right\nRepublicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years and it's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I tried to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence and Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit\nSupport for

that you know take up a lot of carbon dioxide every year in fact they take up twenty five percent of all the CEO to that we emit into the atmosphere so imagine losing that that think if we were to lose that seat of carbon dioxide warming would be much\nA past one point five degrees of warming so it's a it's really important to maintain that sink\nAnd when we have burning we are directly emitting C.

the campaign where there isn't any time for for waste or to send the president to a place that a ... in which the outcomes already decided so he's in places that are competitive that are up for grabs and and and in which he can make a real difference\nTrump's ability to help is limited though control of the house could be decided in suburban swing districts outside of major democratic strongholds but an NPR analysis finds Trump is largely avoiding those areas Jesse Ferguson is a democratic\nTo a suburban swing district most vulnerable Republicans would likely be busy washing their hair\nTrump is concentrating his efforts in areas where in twenty sixteen he outperformed previous Republican candidates places like Erie, Pennsylvania where he campaigns last week areas ... says\nThat are you know fashions of of Trump is that it can really are are more Trump and Republican\nTrump is campaigning for a mix of House Senate and gubernatorial candidates who is Debbie and puts it are echoing the president's message on policy triumphs most boldly and proudly boisterous rallies or a big part of the Trump experience\nBut the people who attend to these rallies aren't necessarily Republicans or

members those in attendance with the Republican nominee\nRepublican pollster Robert blizzard who worked on a congressional special election in Ohio where Trump held a rally on the eve of voting says he saw the president boost enthusiasm among based Republicans and in the places Trump is going he doesn't see much risk of it backfiring since\nI mean democratic voters on a one time scale or any other like Thirteen\nWhich is to say democratic enthusiasm is\nSee among Republicans is a bigger concern\nAt this point in time Republicans will get all the negatives that are associated with the president we sure as heck my you know like going to go after the positives as well\nThe Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson isn't so sure about that\nWhen he goes to a district she is a reminder that Republicans in Congress had become is yes and voters rely Shaq and balance [noise] not a servant\nDoes the president help more than he hurts it's a debate waged every midterm Trump said this week
