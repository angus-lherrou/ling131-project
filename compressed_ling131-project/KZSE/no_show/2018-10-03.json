Johnston is known as the first lady of Minnesota civil rights and with good reason she arrived here in Minnesota in the mid fifties and by the mid sixties had become one of Minnesota's and frankly one of the nation's preeminent leaders on a full range\nOf civil rights issues in Nineteen Seventy one she became the first African\nAmerican appointed to the University of Minnesota board of regents uh later on she went on to serve as associate vice president for academic\nAffairs after you and I think it's fair to say we're all fortunate that all these years later after doing all of that stuff both Dr Johnson and vice president Mondale are still dispensing wisdom\nAnd calling on all of us to do what we can to make this world a better place to live\n[laughter]\nYou to go back an awfully long way a\nBetter part of sixty years yeah how did you get started working with each other we read um because they're both devoted to civil rights\nAnd Joe see was the leader star and are we became friends

chief lobbyist for the fair housing so I had a chance to learn about\nDespite the problems here Mr Mondale we were still where are we not seen as a kind of national leader on civil rights\nOr like I say here's where we went bring up Hubert Humphrey Humphrey Humphrey was a mixed drawer very pioneer\nAnd the manager was to get rid of racial activities and he uh\nStarted out here as mayor of Minneapolis\nAnd um he among\nOther things he got rid of discrimination against Jews missions and very ... community\nAnd um he\nThe fight for for employment ... and started the the the long march were Minnesota ended up leaving the country\nYou are very much a part of it but he\nUm [noise] when you look at this she ah\nRight from the beginning had decided that this was going to be the central issue is life and you even\nToward the end of his career you just scratch them a little bit and he started talking about civil rights and before before he got done Minnesota\nWe were perfect even then but we'd come a long long way and the ... and Minnesotans had come to believe that civil rights was the right way to go not everybody but most and are\nYou talked about it just started about fair housing I'm One of the last great civil rights\nBills to be adopted was the fair housing act which I offered and you you were fighting for it here may be the toughest of all the civil rights\nIssues because it was civil rights coming north it wasn't just\nAh being irritated by how bad the southerners we're was\nContemplating what we were doing to deal just with our neighbors and um so we've got for housing Supreme Court just strict for about three years ago four years ago but it's still being poorly enforce so\nYou have three really three major victories back then fair housing act sixty eight civil rights act sixty four voting rights act Nineteen sixty five [noise]\nUm and again I think it's fair to say a lot of people assumed well Bert everything's taking care of 'em but here we are or what fifty sixty years later\nJustice for a mirror at Westminster is talking about or eliminating dismantling racism all these years later what happened well first of all I'm Glad you're doing to the edge it's absolutely no shirts went to take a short period of ... yeah or clean up after them\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] I\nI Believe um\nPeriod I sincerely hope church\nThat we really talk about this there is a tendency is you know in Minnesota\nWe are nice and we don't really talk about things to the dance that they must be the election of twenty six days in my judgment was one that\nFor me\nDefinitely proved how deeply edge in the fabric of America supremacy and the actions of racism are we as a nation\nActually allow old all those things that have not been discussed\nThat are deeply etched in the fabric to surface and to have someone give us permission to do this kind of talk and crushed and we are in my judgment\nAt a moment in Minnesota\nWe have the lowest\nEconomic success\nWhere Mississippi Alabama et cetera and we ask ourselves\nWhy and how did that happen as I said to have Hubert Humphrey\nFritz Mondale Don freezer and a dozen or more on the state and house members who were committed to this issue and\nAnd I believe that a lot of it is so deep it is so deeply etched that we respond on instinct\nAnd much of the instinct is to not really except that there is prejudice and discrimination here why I'm hoping that we'll talk about it\nBecause I have a theory\nThat I Believe we must acknowledge for is in order for us to really talk I maintain that the people who brought my ancestors to America as slaves\nBrought them from West Africa one of the bridges cultural\nCountries and the treatment of my ancestors was so bad\nTreating us as if we were less than human abusing all of our people children included\nThose slave masters in my job\nRules to themselves what they were doing was okay 'cause I don't think you can abuse people day in and day out and remain saying so they had to convince themselves that we were less than\nAnd then design laws policies programs to justify that and to prove that they're right and that's what I mean about it being hatched\nIn the fabric because if you then deny my ancestors\nFrom the rituals that they were accustomed to language cultural behaviors is one of the richest\nParts of the world different language different cultures match just didn't understand that they assumed that we then or ignorant and unable et cetera et cetera so that gets at ... in the fabric\nSo even in Minnesota\nThe image\nOf my black skin and behavior is one that triggers\nThis inner belief that the\nMasters had to justify the treatment and I mean in my friends that unless we can talk about that\nUnless we can understand why people felt that it was better to be in neighborhoods that we're all one ethnic group or\nDeny our children the quality education that they deserve unless we can talk about that and understand it will keep on keeping on it\nJust keep doing it and we try to justify it and figure out what's going on and you've done everything that I Know you could give them\nYou know we're if we're meeting here\nTwenty five years ago or so\nWe'd be talking about the federal law enforcement officers about the department of justice about the U.S attorney here about a state officers that picked up the cause\nAnd lots of progress or making in all across the board where racial discrimination or his heart of us\nWere perfect yet but ah\nIssues of religious freedom for example in America that we need to devote our attention our focus our resources on making sure that everybody's getting a fair shake in the area of religious ...\nWell let's see what they're doing they're trying to change the subject away for why the laws were passed on to other things that they dreamed up and they've got great civil rights advocates like sessions out there trying to tell us what's important and I think I'm a\nWe have not solved civil rights in this country\nWe still have the problems are across the board with minority Americans\nAnd to say that we solve those problems that the laws that were designed to do with them or no longer needed that's that's ridiculous outrageous and um\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

you have done in this room\nAnd I think a lot of it has to do with it for me the struggle of my ancestors\nThey believed in education they sacrifice for education they believed in justice they believed\nIn love care and protection of our children\nThose are the those that was the spirit of black people and their struggle and when you get just a glimpse every once in a while that something is working\nYou then try harder and you find yourself be leaving perhaps there is hope\nIn the future and so you cheat at it I Am beginning at eighty\nSeven years old to question [laughter] how much

not proving to them that the struggles have paid off\nWere not free were not\nBeing the best we can be our children are not getting the best of everything is\nSo they keep trying part of our ancestors

they are telling their stories and their message\nTurks and her colleagues set to work there were huge logistical hurdles to overcome not least the question of whether the show was even coming to Minneapolis when the turtle was said there were more logistics\nAnd one big thing was if it came for two weeks you can't give to matinees\nBut if it came for six weeks we could do to matinees\nAnd

and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nNow some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA ruin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University\nHe says testing the system makes sense\nMean the thing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it'll be good for the president\nBubbling but this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nWe share of the fact that the president might be using such it's just there for political purposes or get trade version of the presidency was under threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real concerns I it'd be so one thing about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts George W E s\nThe suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump they say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes\nAnd that wants to turn people cell phones it's a government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFamous as an accusation is baseless in a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded well there is no opting out of the alert system is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it and attempt to send a personal message\nAnd besides he has Twitter for that Brian Naylor NPR News Washington\nAnd\nComing up later today on all things considered we'll

presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate oh no I don't know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California\nAnd the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom and what did they\nSo the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution\nAnd apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right that enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter dad took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness and too important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you could you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels or ...\nBut he's um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies are in development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel Z or ... or actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price deal\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean France is Arnold is only a fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years um the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know ... it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying

I'm Steve Inskeep Theresa May prime minister of the United kingdom is in a gym she's tried to get a deal to leave the European Union that so far the U.S rejected and many in our own\nConservative party oppose it to today at the party's annual meeting in Birmingham, England she tried again to sell it\nWe are in ... challenging the e you but if we stick together and hold on I Know we can get a deal that didn't isn't the British and NPR's\nFrank Langfitt always holds his nerves and is on the line from London either Frank hey good morning how would you say the prime minister did she actually\nDid pretty well Steve you know usually she is a stiff performers she came out actually in the hall dancing to have as dancing queen she was fully yeah which is not atypical I'm Theresa May move\nBut she was making fun of these awkward robotic dance moves that she put on at a school at a recent trip in South Africa that became a huge name here so for her to poke fun at yourself probably a very good way to start off on the political fun as you're saying she's under pressure from both sides but she remains defiant and she basically doubled down\nTower free trade on good with the EU which of course the giant market over five hundred million consumers but would stop the free flow of your workers coming here and no longer would you be subject to laws made in Brussels is this is the way that she put it\nBack control of all who has no money good job good for the union ... stay with the British people in the national ...\nFrank I suppose it must seem to be in Britain's national interest since she's demanding such good terms that there is no indication she can get them hasn't the European Union already said it won't accept this deal\nWell they have and that's why I think domestically this sounds good but it doesn't seem to fully recognize what the European Union has said and the other challenge that she faces ears that\nShe may have trouble getting a deal like this through parliament given that there was a lot of people in our own party who are against it now she got a couple more weeks these uh before there's this other meeting in Brussels to hammer out an agreement\nAnd you've got to wonder if there might be a compromise down the line although that could be embarrassing given the kind of speech that she just gave the was adamant that you can have the free movement of goods without accepting you workers that would break the rules of the club and eventually people ... think it would lead to this integration of the union\nFrank and I just tell you something that I hear from people here are short as we talk to your periodically you tell us essentially the same story that the British are proposing unrealistic terms that they can get and they go back to square one again and somebody will be listening to that story and say to me have they thought of maybe just voting again on whether they really want to do breakfast\nYeah that that comes up here as well and that is in the newspapers in the conversation there are some polls that have shown a small change but also if you look at the polls actually people are more entrenched in some ways than they were back in two thousand and sixteen I was out in Liverpool last week talked to more than ... eighty people\nAnd today is before a prime minister may she was adamant that there's going to be no re runs of two thousand and sixteen this is what she said\nOh second referendum would be a politician and politicians hunting people on the fifth time and should try again thanks for the moment when he would do just say in all of\nIt is really interesting the conservative party leaders including the likes of may have set all along there not total fans of this Brexit thing but they want to respect the will of the people and that's what I guess you said again what else did she said in the speech\nWell it's interesting branch who was actually the smallest part of the speech it mostly was focusing on his domestic agenda jobs the confidence of the conservative party which previously it's definitely been known for as well as just even the diversity of her own cabinet\nAnd that's because Brecht it has been really divisive for the party it's been a mill stone around the neck of conservatives in last week I was labor party conference up in Liverpool\nAnd they were very they seem pretty United they felt like a government party and waiting and may and the other conservatives I think they know they need to stick together their worst nightmare is being forced into a general election and losing to the Labour Party and that would put labor's leader Jeremy Corbyn he's a socialist in number ... Downing Street and that's something they absolutely don't want to see\nFrank thanks very much happy to do it Steve NPR's Frank Langfitt\nI'm Carrie Miller the princess stayed release nine new prince

NPR News I'm students get\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it is Nobel Prize week so far no bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winters in Stockholm\nComing up the scopes I got to be and how to do this not to let you go and talk on the ocean vents D.C semi NPR's now\nBut you're not gonna do it verbatim translate oh no I don't know who won so half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California\nAnd the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia\nAnd Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution\nAnd apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right that enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did took phage display and applied it to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of\nDiscoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel Z or ... or actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price sale\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years um the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know ... it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to keep

one this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nNow some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA ruin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University\nSays testing the system makes sense\nI think having a testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak directly to the public\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially says when it comes to this presence\nWeight shattered the fact that the president might be using such a shift that for political purposes or get trade a diversion if he felt the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real concerns here I I it'd be something about it but these are not our is that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed a suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts George W E s the suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes that wants to turn people cell phones it's a government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFamous says that accusation is baseless\nIn a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded while there is no opting out of the alert system is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it\nAnd attempt to send a personal message and decides he has Twitter for that Brian

Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked forward at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get or don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years you don't want I don't know [noise] and today and the White House\nBriefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nEither that or just the motor used very compelling and she is like a very fine woman now he\nSeems to be sort of hewing to the line that congrats\nWhich was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really the verging from that line and he was playing it to laugh and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today some\nHow the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine\nHow either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night right well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said\nHer words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her votes now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct absolutely\nHe has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nIn one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise laughter cheered\nAnd you know he was really he really seem to be saying she's an attractive

... and the fabric that covers it comes from China\nBoth products are hit by the new tariffs\nJust within the last week or so we started getting notifications from our vendors that they're going to be some surcharges on a a many of the products that we sell\nThe severity and timing of terror related price hikes will vary for instance some suppliers have inventory in the U.S federal pointed the new tariffs but Schumann says he'll have to pass increase costs along to customers eventually\nWe're going to get hit okay we're unless unless this gets resolved um there's just the time to lay\nThe trade with China will cause him some headaches but Schumann praises Trump for trying to slash the nation's trade deficit with China and boost employment and the U.S\nIs not a particularly nice person but he's willing to step up and take the hit and make this an issue\nA lot of retailers say it's too early to tell what the latest round of terrorists means for them that's why for instance Jeff Sheldon

Cornell has said the retailer is concerned about anything that would cause higher prices on everyday products for American families Cornell has also said that there are many things targets\nUntil a

like the threat of steeper terrorists in January that could spread to more products\nWere really concerned about the potential for these terrorists to hit the clothing that you put on every day the shoes that you put on your feet and the toys that American family the play with everyday\nWhite says it's not fair that consumers are caught in the crossfire\nWe've been trying to tell the administration that these terrorists are being paid by American consumers\nHow much pain retailers and consumers field and when will vary but one thing some retailers had imported holiday season goods from China before the latest tariffs hit\nSuppliers and retailers may also choose to absorb some or all of the cost to avoid raising prices or look to other countries to supply stuff that now comes from China\nBut at the China terrorists go to twenty five percent in January and expand to virtually all imports from the middle kingdom there'll be inescapable paying for retailers and consumers Martin Boylan Minnesota Public radio news\nAnd we continue with all things considered on this Wednesday afternoon the mother of a man killed by a Hastings police officer on Monday says she still doesn't know what events led up to the fatal shooting Tania ... Johnson says or twenty three year old son Keegan Johnson Lloyd\nHas long struggled with mental health and chemical dependency problems but she says she doesn't know why a police officer shot her son Brent Williams spoke with Tonya Johnson and joins us now from the ...\nUm what did Johnson say about her son's first\nWell Johnson said her son was a a guy who would love to make his friends and his family laughed she said he loved to read books or he was working on a memoir of his life\nAnd Jones is that her son's struggle with mental illness began when he was very young she said at the age of four Johnson laid began exhibiting symptoms of anxiety and she said I'm he began self medicating himself at the age of twelve\nNow none of the therapy and medications seemed to help her son and Johnson said that just only frustrated him\nDid Johnson more you have any other run ins with law enforcement before\n[noise] yeah he had and in a twenty fourteen or Johnson Lloyd pleaded guilty to spitting on a police officer\nWhich is a felony or and during that proceeding or Johnson Lloyd's defense lawyer expressed concerns that he may not be competent to enter that kind of a plea\nSo I found a court document which described in an evaluation of Johnson Lloyd and it says quote that he demonstrated many symptoms of major mental illness and chemical dependency he's clearly in need of medical intervention to stabilize his condition to an acceptable level and to quote\nNow Johnson Lloyd underwent a civil commitment proceeding in ... county for chemical dependency and twenty fourteen and was petition ... to be committed as mentally ill in twenty Fifteen\nWhen you spoke to John ... mother was she able to shed any light on what happened before the shooting\nNow she told me her understanding was that her son didn't actually step anyone now Johnson said her son had gotten into a fight with one of his roommates at a sober living facility in Hastings she said that man suffered some scratches in was not going to press charges\nNow Johnson Lloyd apparently he walked away from the home which Johnson said was a place where for the most part residents could just come and go as they pleased but Johnson still\nShock now this incident will sound similar to some others that we've seen do we know if there's been an increase in incidents were police officers killed people who are experiencing or in the midst of mental health crisis\n[noise] you know time we have numbers of people who are killed by police each year but we don't have a good way to definitively say that mental illness with a factor in those shootings now Johnson Lloyd is the seventh person to be shot and killed by Minnesota law enforcement officers this year\nNow some of the people who've died at the hands of officers so far this year were reported to have been experiencing mental health problems remember in July this year Carver county sheriff's deputies shot a sixteen year old boy and chain Hassan who is reported to be suicidal in was carrying what was later found to be a BB gun\nNow I also spoke recently with the head of the Minnesota peace officer standards and training or posts board an eight goals\nAre now ... told me that even before the legislature passed a bill last year\nWhich required a police officers are police departments to train officers in the escalation techniques department said already started doing this type of training and he said that training can be very effective so what are we still waiting for in this investigation\nWell as of now we still don't know the name of the officer who shot Johnson Lloyd we also don't know if Johnson load was armed or tried to attack police on VCA has said officers at the scene where equipped with body cameras but it's still not clear if those

Wisconsin we are talking about ... grove heights Oakdale white barely west St Paul that storm right now near you or very shortly\nAnd then in a few minutes St Paul Rosemont south St Paul in lake Elmo that's a severe thunderstorm warning will get more from meteorologist Paul had near in just a few minutes as we continue with all things considered\nBut only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents to talk more about the d._a. chess inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel\nHey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration well\nIt contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary just in the Olson\nIt is important is Jeanette that these miners are very well taken care of don't believe that perhaps they are very well taken care of it\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da jazz\nHeld hundreds of migrant children border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days and many of these children were held\nHe is near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assist in after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere was no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nAs the administration often does it is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote ... does say that it deserves some credit for working quote ...\nAgain they were ordered to do so by a judge but the age has also acknowledge that the government's computer systems still do not communicate across these agencies ... are there any children who still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Joe You're welcome [noise]\nMany people in the U.S auto industry are breathing a sigh of relief this week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd we'll send a senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies and make auto parts you're in the U. S. thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the Green Belt will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be in in ...\nContent that will be required for parts to travel through the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum\nA so all of that will impact our members and in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required\nOne of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrible for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they haven't I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent so this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they used to conclude there's this new NAFTA\nAnd be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old me under NAFTA isn't an improvement is worse\nWell I think for the United states perspective one of the things the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U. S. content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral looming them that's from North America and our\nAre not members are going to have is the administrators cost and we're gonna have to work really hard that's all three parties can minimize starts costs because consumers are going to get any value added fed and that's going to be our next a real challenge facing the fault that gray and that\nAnd we'll send is senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association thanks for speaking with us today\nAnd care for pleasure\nSupport from Minnesota Public radio comes from the E.
