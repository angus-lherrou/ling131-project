derisive Lee called the deep state that all started according to many ah with the new deal\nAs as well as a lot of the policies that went along with it the notion that government would be\nResponsible for a lot of things that at least through the nineteenth century and early twentieth century the national government hadn't been responsible for but the states and localities had been doing so the new deal nationalized a lot of what had been previously local and state\nUm and that became known as the new deal revolution um and what I meant by the the the term hedge ammonia or hedge pitch demonic was that it was so successful\nThat even opponents political opponents are Republicans who had been opposed to the new deal when FDR proposed at\n... personally opposed were actually a supportive of

R. go dot com\nRight so is that true yeah [noise] um\nWell no it's not true that the founding fathers sought to minimize in fact it's it's ... it's even less true when it first appears\nBecause the anti federalist had two aspects to their argument one was what they thought was bad about what was being proposed that it would be a national government rather than a state or in government but the other was what would actually happen\nIf you adopt this constitution\nAnd one of the fundamental arguments of this book is that's been lost in American a thought in American history and it was really the real deepest source for this conservative tradition is that originally the anti federal and the federal is if you take out the question is it a good or bad constitution\nSet that aside for a moment and just say well if we adopt this constitution what is it going to look like what is the country going to look like a hundred years two hundred years from now what are the broad parameters what's power are going to look like what are we going to be a commercial or rural country are we going to have cities\nAre we going to be big or small all those kinds of broad\nDescriptive questions that don't\nBear upon whether you want it or not they were almost in complete agreement the anti federal ... painted a picture of a future state of affairs that we've actually come to live that was more a overtly accurate than the federal is themselves painted\nThat it would be a nationalizing regime over time it gets more and more national\nWe're in a over time and they did that by way of harsh criticism right they were trying to rally Americans to defeat the constitution because it would they find a way to end because it would have this trajectory so let me ask you this is a\nAnother Ronald Reagan quote it's from Nineteen eighty eight state of union address he Ronald Reagan says President Reagan quote were for limited government because we understand as the founding fathers that that is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual\nThat actually is the argument of those who were opposed to the constitution\nIt is but the same people that were opposed to the constitution were saying if you get this constitution it won't be that kind of limited government\nAnd eventually the federal is are agreeing with that the federal is make an argument eventually they they make their argument in stages because people had to be persuaded\nOr so initially they would say it's not that different but eventually they do say yeah the NFL's are right where a government of limited purposes but we're not a government of limited powers\nSo we've we've done we've talked about that uh your number one yeah ah we want to get back to the Barry Goldwater okay but before we do can you just say literally a few words about the second moment with Andrew Jackson's comes to jobs of excuse me Andrew Johnson comes just after the civil\nWar heights or after the civil wars you know making as assassinated his vice president is Andrew Johnson\nOr who had been a southern Democrat who he put on his ticket and was at that point at least nominally and in fact in a bit of news station also a Republican and as the war ends\nThe question is what's what are we going to do in this country and as as you know most people in Congress\nAs reconstruction the remaking of the south on terms that the victorious north would dictate\nAnd Johnson opposed to all of that\nJohnson ... Andrew Johnson represented the south even though he was president for a different conception which he called restoration\nAnd the court to his idea was they would certainly can see the proposition that the war settled the question that slavery was now illegitimate slavery is over\nBut everything else including a lot of the institutions that surrounded slavery\nOr how freed blacks would sustain themselves and what would happen to them and all that all that stuff which was of concern to the reconstruction Republicans\nIt is it's sad that the I Would say that the the the ray of light for the libertarian\n... wouldn't be so much that the the story was ended at the beginning that the state would grow it was the story was ended at the beginning unless we have a revolution\nOr that the national government would be responsible for national problems has a policy matter however if the national government has a robust argument and conservatives prevail that the national government should for example decentralized policy\nThat is actually well within the bounds of progressive political architecture of the constitution um because there's a difference between as long as you say as long as you can see\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoors through October an indoor markets open throughout the winter you can visit farmers' markets of M. P. L. S. dot org for market times and locations\nBusiness the argument that that has prevailed and you might say keeps expanding is it is the central government's business but how does it is still very much up to ... up for debate\nSo um what's interesting about this is that means for example because it is the national government's business you even get a Republican president like\nGeorge W. Bush passing a policy No Child left behind which is a national education policy that we used to think was as local as it should be and then you have Democrats turning around and saying hey maybe really just stuff back to the states\nAs long as it's the national government that that has the authority you can have national or decentralized policies and you can have a very robust\nConservative liberal argument within that frame still\nSo is what you're arguing that liberals have basically one in terms of the\nCentral framework of a national government with national responsibility for Social Security Medicare increasingly Medicaid um you know parts of a K. to twelve education but on how it's done on how it's done that there is a vibrant ongoing of aid and the source of that\nIs this conservative tradition that remain alive right yeah so is it really then I'm the most that conservatives can hope for is the kind of um you know kind of do these um ambushes when it comes time to implement policies is that is that they're the greatest possibility\n[noise] well ... in the policy realm as opposed to the constitutional realm or conservatives can do and do do a lot\nSay you know we've been doing things wrong let's do it a different way and ah let's make the bureaucracy smaller and in some uh places that's being done\nWhat I think has been lost however is the argument and I think it actually should be lost unless we change the constitution and it's always ... where in principle always open to changing the constitution even though it's politically\nUnlikely that you would do that by the way it mainly because the conservatives um but the constitution is what set settle the issue of where the authority lies\nBut it's not merely policy matter um you can actually do quite a lot are now the one exception to this that I find interesting which we do talk about in the book\nIs um you remember the big push back against Obamacare by conservatives it's bad say national health it's like socialized medicine\nAnd one of the arguments they made against it is it was going to take away their Medicare\nWell they were opposed to Medicare when Medicare was proposed\nBut once the stab list people get used to it Hamilton mentioned this in the federalist papers and if it's working pretty well for them they're going to like it\nAnd so conservatives ended up defending Medicare in their attack on Obamacare and it was partly out of fear by the way that if Obamacare lasted long enough people might like that to your book\nIs I Would say a I'm a helping hand conservatives to show that there is this\nThis um conservative intellectual tradition it deserves more attention but you're also a free with the criticism that the confidence and understanding and using that conservative tradition is is not I'm always there and I actually I think the health care debate\nIs another example both the confusion about Medicare it's a national program\nThe other side of it is that the compromise that ... bomber made was to include some very significant market mechanisms such as these individual market health insurance exchanges and this is precisely what is being undermined\nToday by Republican right it is the kind of traditional conservative approach does that fit in this kind of pattern of I I don't like today's Ikle yet or every\nI don't think it does I think that what you're describing now a has to do with something that is really fairly recent and it's not something that is is explicit topic of our book it's sometimes called hyper partisanship other people call it tribalism\nA there's a a a book or it's even worse than it looks by men and orange ... uh about this if you're interested in the basic idea behind it is that uh if you if you can seat of your party as tribes rather than traditional political parties\nYou actually don't care so much what they stand for anymore so that what they described in there as you actually oppose\nBills that are offered by your opponents that you had that you had designed because you don't want them to get credit for and he give they give a lot of examples about like that\nAnd so that puts you in this perverse situation in which Republicans will oppose a Democrats on the ideas that they themselves had previously been four and less often but sometimes the Democrats will do the same thing against Republicans are just because they don't want them to get the credit\nOr we've actually got a several questions from our friends in the audience on just that the main one with one question on that theme is what would Barry Goldwater think of today's Republicans\nWell he already said before he died that he was ...\nUh he was a libertarian a and he thought that a lot of the social conservative aspects of Republican\nOrthodoxy today uh\nFor example the positions on abortion and so forth [noise]\nWe're uh we're getting into ... were were infringements on liberties of people and uh and and uh he was strongly opposed and began to distance himself from the Republican Party as it came to be developed\nSo uh I think that he would be upset with the party but I think he'd be even more upset\nWith the current president because if there is any\nOne who had a notion of leadership antithetical to to Goldwater's it would be Trump I mean Goldwater was all about a set of ideas and and the diminishing of his own person and Trump is all about elevating has person\nAnd either on concern with ideas or using them simply as resources\nJust to pick up on this question that several of folks have asked about uh about the the\nConnection or lack of connection between Barry Goldwater and the current Republican Party do you also see you'd mentioned the the social conservative part I'm a kind of run a against Barry Goldwater's\nUm thoughts how about some of the\nWays in which Republicans have actually ended up expanding government you'd referred to George W Bush's uh leave No Child behind which ended up nationalizing parts of K. twelve education there is also his creation of a new entitlement and the Medicare program for prescription drug benefits\nThat something also that yeah I think you're right I mean I haven't thought a lot about it but when I listen to you mentioned it I think\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoors through October an

against Macintosh Johnson how did the investigation and fooled will basically this was an organization that has had some rumors around it and it was no one in Liberia that there'd be an accusations of rape but a really no one had ever going deep and to\nReally find out what exactly happened and why it happened and also one of the interesting things about it is that the organization right after this happened it was never a negative repercussions their scope of operation within the country has grown there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nAre the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in its care or so when the rates came to light the organization essentially said and this was in their press statement that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central mine and organization had an intimate relationship with the wind or they\nDidn't acknowledge the extent to which they had empowered him by giving him the power to the educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school and then when it came to light that he had been reaping these girls they essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own\nOperating cultures and challenging context may have contributed to his ability to access and abused young girl\nDemand ended up in prison and went through a trial but that trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that way when he died he had aids so it's possible that\nThese girls would be raped will actually infected as well the challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so while the organization took steps to make sure that the ten girls who had testified\nAgainst him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named dozens victims pot denied it tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the\nInvestigation really failed to confront and meaningful way and uh\n[noise] so what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate do you know there'll be unity changes

sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually that was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped one of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time\nTwo girls were the first time according to their statements at least some definitely the organization type

Kennedy had enormous crowds in Nineteen sixty he was constantly straining to fire codes\nOr the night before the election he was at the Boston Garden weigh twenty two thousand people were estimated to be there I was actually there David and it was terrifying there were so many leave him while I'm but also keep in mind that in early history\nIt was considered unseemly for presidents and presidential candidates to campaign though they did it through surrogates a course which is pretty much what Trump is doing for Republican candidates this year where there was a time when Kennedy didn't want to campaign I Know isn't it doesn't sound restful and you know real but [laughter] but Andrew Johnson when he was president did go out\nCampaign against the Republicans in Congress that he thought a word to radical\nIt was called his swing around the circle it backfired totally um it didn't help that he often appeared to be drunk and sometimes fell off the platform of growing up but it's also true that much of the public and press a thought it was just undignified for the president to engage in that campaign\nWell then the next question comes from someone who uses the Twitter name with you hear this give me a freaking bridge above freezing branded after it was there ever a time when money wasn't an issue it sounds snarky but I'm hoping\nHistory has a positive example of where it wasn't that the question so was money ever not so involved\nI hate to disappoint give me a freaking break but basically money's been there since the beginning or we talked recently on one of these talks about how George Washington had wind and dined voters when he was running for the Virginia house of purchases right cause that body to pass the nation's first campaign finance law him\nThe first few presidential campaigns were not particularly a dependent on money uh but that changed with Andrew Jackson and Eighteen twenty eight when he ran much more of a grassroots campaign\nThat's going to be really important work to do and some of the political tension we have now is largely reflective of the banks that you know some Americans have over are changing demography\nSo you know when as you go in continue to do this work and other groups of course do this work we think reconciliation looks like in the state of it\nThe perspective that something like reconciliation is not an event a but it's a process and it it takes time\nYou know it took human beings thousands of years to push each other into a pit this deep it is going to take us a little while to climb out\nAnd so rather than looking for a political event or even a political process a mandate like the kind we had in South Africa um we really believe that this was a process that's going to happen kind of one relationship at a time one effort at a time\n[noise] professor trailer I'm going to leave it there thanks for your time hey thank you so much Anton Troyer is a Professor Rosen professor of job away at the ...

sales grew one hundred and eighty seven percent and the second quarter of this year on the other hand and always on always connected listening to by sitting home with a video screen or camera really freaks some people out\nSo let's dig into this and quality assurance the segment where we take a deeper look at a big tech story Tom Barrett is the hosted the pod cast daily tech news show he said before you decide whether to worry about smart speakers you should know what you're worried about\nIt's kind of the new the CIA is listening into my telephone I mean we all had Mike's in our house with telephones a long time ago and there were misperceptions about what could actually be done or even if it could be done how often it was done\nUh it's pretty well audited that these things are only listening for the wake word and not sending things to the cloud I think there's a lot of worry about the wrong things with the smart speakers you shouldn't be aware of what it is collecting but on the other hand I don't think that you need to worry that it's constantly spying on\nYou yeah I mean I feel like the reason we're having the conversation is fundamentally about this trust thing and it's hard to say yes they're gathering data about you and you don't need to worry about it I think\nIt's all about knowing what they're collecting and knowing what they're using it for I think that's where the trust got lost if people didn't realize it was being collected and what it was being used for people voluntarily let Nielsen collect information about them all the time because they go in with eyes wide open I'm going to get this benefit in exchange for giving them\nThat knowledge and I think that's the situation you need to adjust yourself to his what benefit am I getting by doing this I'm able to turn the lights off in my house with the speaking of a word is that okay in exchange for Amazon knowing oh this person as smart lights the next time I go to Amazon dot com I'm going to show them some suggestions for that kind of\nProduct we're kind of like guinea pigs I think at this point for all\nNew and it's where the first generation I think you could argue that really are having to wrestle with these questions about privacy can we even really understand the longer term consequences of the decisions were making today\nNo I I think that's a good point is that nobody knows these companies don't know what the consequences of their collection are uh I think in large part they are doing it out of a profit motivation or it's not necessarily for your good but I don't think they have an evil intent or either\nIt's an amoral intent for a large part and I don't know that they knew what the consequences were and a lot of this backlash is a surprise to them because they drink their own Kool Aid and thought yes but you're getting this great free service that were provided why would you be upset with the little data collection\nThat's Tom merit hosted the daily

I think his actions and trying to force a trade and become more and more dramatic\nIncluding the scene and Wednesdays practice where he reportedly grabbed a group of reserves and a beat the starters in scrimmage\nAnd a curse doubt anyone who got near him a including some ... and the direction of ah the the ... general manager so he's not doing anything that is conducive to having any kind of long term future of Minnesota will just put it that way okay\nHe's only been with the team for a season though right I mean did they truly a bunch of good players to get it\nIf they made a big sacrifice to get him but uh if you look back to ah his playing career with the Chicago Bulls this is pretty much how things ended there he was unhappy with the team he was unhappy with personnel decisions\nAnd he became more and more of a pain in the bud that uh the bulls felt it was in their best interests to trade him and um what you didn't know at the time is a this apparently is a habitual and one of the things that's interesting about\nThe teams that he's talked about going to in recent weeks as none of them are very good so he's clearly he clearly wants to be the big deal on a team and the the wolves or have not really heard any offers from what we can told from what we've been told that that make them want to sacrifice\nA butler but we may be coming to a point where owner Glenn Taylor might just finally say we've got to be gone with us\nFranchise uh just let's get this done even if we take a loss\nThat the timing of this couldn't be worse I mean they start the regular season what next week\nRight in tonight in Milwaukee is the final exhibition game and nobody's going to care about the game as much as what happens on the bench and in the locker room\nThe season opens next Wednesday at San Antonio and the home opener\nA is a week from today against Cleveland and quite frankly this uh the drama is not translating into a ticket excitement as you can imagine there's

F. D. Ninety nine\nIt close for check writing centers of by agency eliminated five percent\nOf our agency's workforce save two billion dollars improve the service the American people that's what I did with the job I've I've moved bill through the Congress I've worked in the Congress I have the experience to know where the bodies are buried and go out there on on earth and reform government and downsize government\nDancing in any response yeah Washington is full of Jim haggard once that's why it is broken right now people who are beholden to their party leaders people are beholden to corporate pacts and special interests\nWhich is why I have not taken a dime from corporate pacts because I Know that what prevents both parties for moving anything for my hope we get a chance to talk about health care and things like that is the ability of people to have an unwillingness as they do right now that's that's why it was broken and that's what people hate that's why people are cynical about politics today\nWill certainly get a chance to talk to a bone any number of issues if you guys want to uh ... let me I just stay on the area of agriculture for one second though because I did get a question from a listener who said what would you do or what could the federal government do to address\nIn almost all southern Minnesota lakes and streams\nDancing do you want to start with that one that's ... that's ... ... we have we have to take advantage that farmers are stewards of their own land first and foremost and the idea that I think you need to have to make policy through carrots and sticks\nAnd it's incumbent on the rest of the community that's not an farming to do their part to clean up water too\nBut you have to have investment too and that's where the idea of infrastructure comes in because empathy structure is not just roads and bridges butts in investment in water and no one knows that more than the south west corner of the state in the community Worthington that desperately needs not it's not just a matter of quality of water but having water in the first place\nThere's a role here for the farmers to play that because they've been a part of doing incredible work to clean up water along the way they\nShouldn't just be based on carrots alone that's something I Want to make sure and stand up because the idea of regulations as becomes part of a sudden imagine my opponent we'll talk about here has the one in which farmers are a part of the conversation leading the conversation because they at the end of day have as much interest if not more in the quality of land the soil and water to be there Jim Hagedorn and clean water\nI was just talking with Kevin pap the head of the Minnesota Farm Bureau about these very issues two days ago you know Farm Bureau endorsed me because they they want somebody is going to be pro egg and this has to be a balance you know what's been going on over the last many years against farmers has been an overreach during the Obama administration we had a war against agriculture\nAnd part of that was led by the APA under Obama that put out this waters of the United states which was a complete overreach we had people in Minnesota weather buffer strips and everything else\nAnd it's just it's gone too far you know they don't give the farmers credit for for being good stewards of the land farmers don't want to want to waste their fertilizer and and things like they don't want to do that costs them money and so they are good stewards of the land I think we need to work together but what needs to happen for somebody who wants to represent southern Minnesota very egg based district\nKeep the input cost of farming down get rid of these onerous regulations in Washington Let's have the reins act with\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from the E.

I Hope we can talk about that a little bit later when I support is this getting back to having insurance you know act like insurance let people and this would be the biggest tax cut most people get let people spend money for insurance medical care prescription\nNobody pays federal tax on that money anymore that's where what what are you should have an individual tax reform moving forward then have accounts out there that so they can invest that money say but they have incentives for healthy living because we don't spend it you get to keep your own money\nOr have transparency and cost very important across the board so people can shop major medical catastrophic coverage with a with a doctor bill that would be reasonable that can be done by the insurance companies for private sector and\nAfter that a a pool for people high risk pool for people with preexisting expensive medical needs paid for by the insurance companies backed up by the government everybody gets quality timely care everybody is a good spot nobody goes broke over it that's how insurance should operate\nCan I just ask you a question though because uh Obamacare said ah kids could stay on their parents' insurance till they were to six and it also said that the insurance companies couldn't discriminate against people with preexisting medical conditions\nThat we weren't doing that in Minnesota if you want to add twenty six that's fine\nBut the state's can handle it I trust that the state of Minnesota where the good governor and legislature going to get it right much more so than H H s bureaucrats deciding the standards of care for our doctors taking away our our doctor patient relationships\nLook you know Obamacare was an absolute disaster for southern Minnesotans we people paying twenty and thirty thousand dollars a year for premiums\nWould deductible so highly underline insurance is virtually worthless\nOkay let's let Dan Feehan talk about this how do you uh\nAn important point of approach to my my opponent likes to bring up conversations from two thousand ten\nBecause he's been running for Congress since two thousand ten and that's an important point I'm I'm living in twenty eight team right now in the reality of a health care system that is failing people in every way shape or form the status quo is not working but what you heard from my opponent here is offering a chance to go backwards I don't think that is a ... as an option right now that we can even consider with any seriousness we\nHave to go forward so we have to I Believe in the market of of of ah and the principal free markets here but\nLet's talk about the individual market I talked to a farmer at farm fest who's two kids had the flu went to get them treated and paid seven hundred and fifty dollars out of pocket for that her reaction to that was that she simply wouldn't go to the doctor next time because it wasn't worth it so what are you going in a country in a country where flu deaths are on the rise\nSo what I Would propose to do inserts simply as the idea of a public option that people can buy into public option into Medicare so that people are paying for it and it becomes an alternative because everything that my opponent just described here of the private system right now it is a for profit system in which people are attempting to make money off of people's health\nThere has to be something that has to be another option there that had has makes an incentive for companies to drive the prices downwards and not continue to make a buck off of people and the only way that Congress is going to be able to to\nDo all the way forward on this is to not have people under the influence of big pharma and insurance companies something which my opponent is under the influence of himself and something I'm not\nA gym hanging on what's wrong with letting people buy into Medicare uh well\nIt it will destroy the system for Medicare for one thing and it's not well it's going to cause the systems about bankrupt now so you're going to add to it here or hang onto it hanging out here as well okay take it to whoever you want but that's my my contention\nThe the concept of Medicare for all socialized medicine universal healthcare a single payer whatever you want to call it\nIs going to destroy medicine or do they know they're all different kinds of oil there isn't going to destroy medicine as you know it it's going to make sure that we have\nInferior medical quality medical innovation will suffer more if you want if you want people more people on Medicare guess what the Mayo Clinic and all the fine institutions of medicine are going to be reimbursed at fifty cents on the dollar rather than a dollar on the dollar they can't sustain the model\nIf you do this is going to destroy the progress and growth in Rochester, Minnesota and a lot much of southern Minnesota all those buildings going up all the people that flow and to Rochester that comes to an end\nOh you want to the vision you ought to put people in charge that are going to take us to socialize medicine or do you want people in charge to get keep us with a private so as far as incentives are concerned and this is America is the way we do business we have people instead of\nCompanies go out there and produce good medical devices and so forth and and drugs and everything else doctors go to school for many years and they want something to return there's nothing wrong with that okay Dan Feehan response\nAbsolute bringing in the in the Mayo Clinic is absolute right idea here and they have to be at the table with but this is an institution founded founded and has been a leader in the world on healthcare so why not to have them at the table and we're talking about large scale health reform\nI Do agree with that report and what would you do about it Dan Feehan\nYes I agree with that report and it shouldn't be a function of of that first question is what do you do about is an excellent we've had a couple of debates and last week uh we had one a couple of nights ago which my opponent\nOr declared that he wasn't sure about climate change that it was just the earth warming and cooling as usual well I I have a different perspective on this I have a perspective of people like secretary Jim Mattis and the perspective of the ... the chairman of joint chiefs General Dunford who believe that long term\nThe biggest threat facing our country in terms of security is climate change\nAnd in this question of what you do about has to be the next immediate question\nAnd the next immediate question has to be answered where the perspective of southern Minnesota to where we've had an incredible amount of rain recently and more and more continuously\nThat is changing the way we're farming that is changing the landscape of our district that's taking the hookah falls in racing them from the face of the earth it's real and it's here and so a function of what we do in the in the ... the advent of our president not embracing the Paris climate accord and not a bracing the threat that this poses to all of us\nIs to make sure we're doing everything possible locally and that's to make sure\nThat we aren't relying on fossil fuels and we're making continual effort to not do so and it's making sure that people like in the U.S navy or trying to become energy independent and that you were championing those technologies because they will be to the benefit of all of us along the way\nBut if you're opening premise again is the idea that I don't believe in it well then we have another thing coming because I I'd I'd like you to to give it as a response to the chairman the joint chiefs of staff for example\nHas a you know whether you believe in it or not really doesn't matter what you would do about it if you think it's a problem and it's manmade well then what are you going to do about it there are a lot of people out there including on the left who would say spend money to relocate make changes but to transform our energy sector\nAnd the turn our economy upside down over the premise that at some point the world comes to an end no I don't agree with that because it would be highly destabilizing for our economy and it would drive up the cost\nFor everybody in our country and make us less affluent why support is this I support a policy of energy independence for the United states\nAnd that means in all of the above approach now Dan doesn't understand the issue I don't believe because the United states is worse is energy independent for every source except crude oil\nSo the only way we're going to become energy independence is to drill for more crude oil in the United states which I support\nAnd I think the ... the Trump Administration has done a good job in this area and we also need to make sure that we have the infrastructure in place to utilize and inefficient way our energy resources and we have more energy resources than any other country in the world\nPipelines distribution points refineries those are the things that the Democratic party are too fond of anymore and that's why a lot of laborers are leaving their party they only want to build pipelines this and birch thing they don't they don't like Keystone you know that President Obama blocked that and then after that just make sure we have a policy in place that we have\nAbundant

climate accord support cap and trade do what do you what do you support\nThe support and you and do some portrayal regulations on fracking just to be clear you don't support any of those ... those answers to do nothing\nOr do you what if if the chairman the giants are here now are still and told you about the risks posed this is a very real thanks let's basis and national security there are military US military installations around the world at risk because of climate change\nTheir very place right now if if we if you came forward and say we need to do something about climate change with these what was your reaction\nBe loved if General Mattis said that and he said probably would say we have to adapt we have to react we have to do whatever we can but I didn't I didn't hear general manager came out safe for the Paris climate accord sees for for a ban on fracking now he's our that his\nWork too hard but as a tack roles that is to ensure that we are we're supporting and defending our service members and so again if military installations around the around the world these are these are American troops are at risk because of climate so how does it matter of belief how'd you get there Dan fee and do you put a tax on carbon what do you do\nLook we have to make sure that we're doing first and foremost an ability to make energy the make ourselves as a country energy independent and that means going away from fossil fuel\nAnd as long as we are engaging in anything with with fossil fuels we have to do it in the safest possible way\nBut if we aren't doing everything to make up for the inaction of not being involved in the Paris climate accord than\nWe are going to fall further and further behind the best thing I can do is a member of Congress is to make sure that it climate reform bill makes its way forward entertaining any idea possible to reduce our carbon footprint and that's why I'm open to it but it has you have to be open to actually changing things and taking advantage of the opposite\nIn southern Minnesota to take and champion in ... a renewable energy like solar and wind\nAnd or biofuels way one more\nYou know you walk through a parade last year in Albert lea with a sign that said to act on climate change will put it up on our Facebook page later\nAnd you come on the show and we had three debates and he was still won't tell us what you want to do to act on climate change you do support a carbon tax you do support the Paris climate accord\nYou do support that happened I read it twice already and it was a matter of listening it happened when you do support the regulations that Obama had on fracking and methane and all these things to stop us from getting our own resources\nAnd that's why the farm bureau in the farmers and other support me 'cause they know and what do you get what's the farmers supposed to do to act on climate is supposed to stop farm in the day or start to stop farm and tomorrow for hours but there are\nMore resilient and to actually deal with the impact right now something that I remember we had a tough time answering at a farm fest if I remember right\nHow do we actually make sure that in the advent of southern Minnesota that's dealing with more rain than ever before that's dealing with an acre of temperature is how do we make sure our crops or more recently along the way again this is a matter of action Jim not inaction down a difference between us again\nI think I think your positions now are clear and they don't represent reflect the views and values of southern Minnesota I Do believe minute will let the voters decide\nOkay I'll let me ask you this question or do we need a wall on the Mexican border\nCourse of course we need a wall we need a wall and need fencing we need every kind of security border we can so that ill illegal folks\nDrugs everybody else don't come over and don't come into the United states unless they come here through legal process absolutely Dan's against the wall we've we've got 'em on you know he's he's commented on that we get that\nBut you know overall what we need to do and this has been a problem for thirty and forty years we finally have a president that wants to deal with it let's secure America's borders once and for all now Wallace just a half the problem\nYou know the other half the problem is that we have five or so million people who have flown\nNever left there here unlawfully they shouldn't be some of them from terrorists countries uh some of them you know could be people just like on nine eleven who causes problems we need to secure our country and many different ways we also need merit based immigration where the most generous country in the world for bringing in immigrants a million a year that's wonderful\nBut we should be in a position to know who's coming are they going to assimilate it pretty good chance that they can contribute to our economy\nYou know are they going to become part of the fabric of America because if they're not we truly it's not good for us to have them here OK okay Dan Feehan\nAbsolutely at the the premise of the question is is law to me\nThat we need to keep our country safe yes absolutely and we need to make sure we're doing everything possible to do so and there was no one better to represent southern Minnesota in an interest in someone who spent two tours in Iraq\nServing this country keeping this country safe and who spent three and a half years in the Pentagon trying to keep this country safe and I'm insulted by the idea that my opponent thinks that I wouldn't be able to to be a part of this conversation\nBecause that's not what my service taught me frankly in the first place and if we're thinking about how to keep this country safe it doesn't start with the one way you do it it starts with a broader conversation about them very much the real threats facing our country which increasingly\nDon't have anything to do with the border but increasingly do what cybersecurity bioterrorism and the many different ways that you can enter this country if our entire focus is spent on the idea of the wall we are going to miss things that are bigger threat to this country along the way\nIf you want to have that conversation great do you have a conversation about immigration reform I'd be happy to do that because that's what I hear consistently in the district\nPeople in need of workers people who want an economic case for immigration reform a moral case a national security case\nBecause inside of the Minnesota we need to take advantage of the human capital we have to keep our economy strong NATO I'm someone who is a prominent a believer and a guest worker program a vigorous one I'm someone who believes and making DACA law and I'm someone who believes in the hardworking

that reflect what the people of southern Minnesota want\nThey want border security they don't want the sanctuary politics that view and walls and others are talking about you know you're on record

Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is and the knowledge meant by the Vatican\nIn Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think\nThat the people have Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely and eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nCourse but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but\nFace especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone\nTo come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nKnow what your offices report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think\nThere is our reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to\nHold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on but the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania's state attorney general

doing its workers ...\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven the document contained in detail list of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWe called the road map in our office because it was just that\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nThe national or let me see a lot of stuff from the water ... a year to that

court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry Schwartz stone\nRelevant historians it's relevant to the infringe that ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to
