Conan\nAnd I'm Heather Cox Richardson with democracy test the first thing Donald Trump did following his inauguration was to send his press secretary out to why Sean Spicer is claim about the size of the crowd on the mall was not only falls it was obviously demonstrably false\nSince and the president and spokespersons it issued a blizzard of lies so sick and so fast that it's hard to keep up\nIn this final episode of our series truth and faith will ask about the meaning and the corrosive effect of all of those laws will explore the moral and ethical basis of our faith and democracy and try to summarize some of the lessons learned in these programs\nProgramming is supported by Mira a new kind of precision pain clinics ... pinpoints paying at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up to the patients long term health and wellbeing mirror clinics dot com\n\nThanks so much for having me off so you argue that the moment I just mention the lie about the size of the crowd on the mall on inauguration day but that marks the transition for Donald Trump from what you call commonsense populism does something much darker\nWhy don't you begin with commonsense populism what do you mean by that sure\nWell there is a long tradition in American political life of talking about truth in a sort of folksy vain and there's always been something I think of a tension between a kind of highbrow resulted rhetoric off and backed up by\nSophisticated statistics and claims rooted in science and a advanced learning of various kinds and more folksy style that sort of says\nI Know things when I see them like the kind of a kitchen table logic that says you know there is no global warming because I went outside today and it was warmer than it was this time last year and in some ways that's a very long tradition American political life and at times I think Trump\nHits that court in an ordinary sort of way using plain language folksy analogies kind of appealing to an every man style but then there are other moments when that isn't quite the idiom that he draws upon and I think that moment you mentioned about the question about\nThe inaugural crowd is an odd one because to lie about something in which the evidence is so Shibley clearly in front of everybody is to suggest not ally as a cover up but a lie is a kind of\nPolitical strategy of sorts onto itself\nAnd what is that strategy\nSupport for NPR's brought you by the law firm of ... intellectual property group with offices in Minnesota in Los Angeles Inskeep ... group aims to help companies leverage the power of patents to protect their innovation you didn't find out more at ... dot\nCom already is essentially going to reside would in me\nBecomes a political strategy unto itself that common sense can become a kind of way to push back to say you know back to that inauguration crowd to say but you know I I looked at the photos\nAnd one of them is half empty and that couldn't be the biggest crowd in history and that might seem like it doesn't work into convince anybody in the moment\nBut it's essential that as many people as possible keep doing that\nKeep relentlessly reminding us of the sort of basic facts as a pushback against a world in which it's very hard to tell what's what\nIt's impossible to miss how often Trump pro to most outlandish laws in the mouths of others he says you know a lot of people are saying that broke Obama was born in Kenya to sort of thing is that just an attempt to plausible deniability or is that a specific technique\nAnd that's an interesting question it's a way to keep everybody confused sick as much as anything else I think it sets a technique that says how do we know anything everything's up for grabs\nSome people are saying that some other people are saying that uh he sometimes says I've been hearing you know but without saying from home or with what evidence so it seems to me a whole bunch of rhetorical strategy that'll work in the same way which is to say I don't have facts and figures I don't need facts and figures and if I had them they'd\nBe distorted any way you can't really trust into the FBI the center for Disease Control New York times whatever it is I go by instinct\nTo speak but the danger there is that nobody knows anything about anything then\nOther politicians can't help but notice that you appear to be able to campaign fact free and still be elected president these days do you think that's going to be part of the Trump legacy\nYeah that's that's of course the great worry because Trump didn't create the phenomenon of trumpet unto itself he didn't ... you know drop out of the sky and you won't be around forever either the question is will\nThis style of politics\nRemain and if it does what does it mean for democracy and going forward I think she at the moment all over the world we're seeing that this is a pretty effective technique that in the age of um [noise]\nThe Internet particularly it's very easy to spread untruth in such a way that it's not even clear what the truth and what's in truth any more\nPopulist style at least has\nTaken over in many corners of the world with quite different political traditions so whether this is going to turn out to be a sort of blip in American history that's certainly possible in the U.S has weathered many crises in the past including of course civil war\nOr whether this is going to be a sort of turning away from this moment\nOf enlightenment inspired ideas of truth I think is very hard to say it and I don't think we're at a point yet in which we can really protect which way the winds are going to blow not only the U.S but in England for instance as well Great Britain there's enormous political division I mean it's just about half the population is\nMoving one direction while the other half is moving the other way\nSo that kind of polarization either suggests we're heading to some sort of real social breakdown or that one side is ultimately going to prevail and what can be pretty brutal struggle\nYou know it's interesting we speak of transformational presidents worker Franklin Delano Roosevelt or or Ronald Reagan moved to ... to put down here\nMay be the case I mean he does seem in some way to be breaking from a tradition of their one can look at policies and say well there's certain amount of continuity with say that George W. Bush years and ah in some areas and the others not and certainly um\nThe Republican Party hasn't been transformed overnight\nBut yet there is something different and\nI think it explains some of the kind of hysteria in opposition and I think it explains the very fact that every newspaper in the country is now sort of putting on the front page of chronicle of lives of the President's Day after day something that's really hard to imagine in a previous moment in quite the same form\nSo something has really shifted beneath us and yeah that might make that might make Trump despite himself in some ways a transformational president\nIs he not simply appealing to the anti intellectual strain that has a long history in this country me at that whole idea of why should you listen to experts why should you listen to egg heads just use your common sense that seems to be something that's been a strain in GOP history since at least Ronald\nReagan absolutely so that's where I see a certain amount of continuity and ah I think in the long history of democratic public life in the U.S most evident but it's true elsewhere to has been a kind of conflict from the beginning between a growing\nA emphasis on expertise and ah facts and figures\nAnd knowledge derived from elite to various kinds particularly educational eats but that's often means also economic elites on the one hand and this kind of populist tradition sometimes just as a rhetorical covers sometimes more profoundly but a story about the people being dispossessed of their\nBasic no how an instinctive sense of how things should be and how they are and trucks\nBut I think that the pushback\nThat we might call populist is shorthand comes also from a recent triumph of a more technocratic vision of troops so when Europeans protest against the European Union or Americans complain about politics inside the beltway\nThey're complaining about some of the same things which is a kind of politics that seems cut off from real people that doesn't ask real people what their concerns are doesn't care about their values and populism says you know ... throw it all out throw out all that I'm\nA few skating euphemistic language all that\nUm highbrow highfalutin ... studies and get let's get back to what we know\nJust by going about business you know just the the knowledge that comes from experience living in the world\nThere's something of course really hypocritical perhaps you might say about a man like Trump but anyhow the number of political leaders have used that language a port tend themselves to be wealthy educated living right inside that bubble ... trying to pretend they're sort of regular folks\nBut Trump to sometimes described as kind of a cartoon character version of a regular person he's sort of which are larger than life but still has the sensibilities well\nHe's in his supporters secular and the taste of ordinary person alive and I play both ways I think it'd be a TV star at the same time it is also present themselves just a\nTo be a little bit richer than everybody yeah\nThanks very much [noise]\nSevere Rosenfeld new book is democracy then prove to shore two streets she's the ... professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from the ...

of this series is that American democracy has survived serious challenges in the past crises that proved the resilience of our institutions are belief in each other our determination to make our country a fairer and more decent place\nAll of those principles are being tested again and there's a long list of books and articles that raised dire warnings of democracies demise so it seems worth asking about the basis of our faith in democracy and how we\nIt's just a better country now than Rogers teaches democratic theory in the history of American and African American political an ethical philosophy at Brown he's the author of a book on the twentieth century philosopher an educator John do we called the undiscovered duly his forthcoming book is\nThe dark in light of the race democracy and freedom in African American political thought\nHe joins us from his home in Warwick Rhode Island welcome to the democracy test\nThank you for having me what was it was a man of many parts but underlying everything I think was his abiding faith and democracy is that something you share\nCan you describe more fully that rows of virtue that you talked about earlier a yes beyond the voting booth what other parts of society have to mobilize to beat back the ...\nThis is the one thing that is quite challenging one of the things that is a big challenge for democracy is that it is a system that relies on the greatest number of people to sustain it\nAnd the greatest number of people often stand outside of the administrative apparatus of a democracy namely\nThey stand outside governmental institutions right so that means from a schools to churches\nTo philanthropic organizations that means every aspect of society must serve as a training ground for democracy\nAnd that means that that that sort of virtues of the trust of courage that means that the willingness to show care and concern for once fellows that we otherwise think\nTuition must also become the hallmark of all of those other minor institutions that I'd just gesture to right now so that means that by democratic virtue has to run all the way down and that is both that both points to the enormity of the task that we have in front of us\nThe difficulty of it but it's also contains with it the possibility of of of a different kind of great\nSo the thing that makes democracy very difficult is the same thing that contains so many wonderful possibilities\nGetting back to John too easy for just a minute he was as we mentioned them in many parts one of those parts wasn't as an educator and is it fair to say that he uh educated in the belief that it was important to have an informed electorate\nOh yeah of course he and for great journalists and philosopher ... men and the Nineteen twenties had disagreements about whether or not\nTo sit and read was up to the task of being properly informed and Lipman disagreed and insisted that the demand that democracy places on us as too great\nThat we actually not poised to be properly informed\nAnd then in fact we need to rely on that kind of intellectual elite John doing just read with that All right and he disagreed based on the idea that ordinary everyday individuals know where the problems are that affect their life chances\nAnd do we insist that that because they know when the problems are that affect their life chances of immediate where they have a kind of local knowledge and then the aim is to combine that local knowledge was more sophisticated expertise\nTo offer a response is that actually properly track and respond to the concerns of the ... so do it was a very believe that\nI and I think that there is actually some truth to it which is why you see I think in our current moment that if you go from district district as the news has been reporting\nWhat you find that there's a good number of folks animated by by issues on on the ground and they seem to be driven to respond to those issues are on the ground\nAnd this was not to say and I'll I'll stop my point here but this is not to say that there still isn't a sort of deficit and a serious one\nOr in terms of being properly informed there's no way to get on about the business of engaging seriously with Trump Administration has base and not think\nThat one is dealing with both of the ministry ... and the citizenry our constituency that isn't properly informed\nAnd so ah how do we deal with that well the way we deal with that is to 'em and good heart does fashion to vote folks out um and devote other folks in\nThe ... come full circle to your idea of civic virtue NF personal virtue that even if you're not following the news and following every twist and turn of what's happening with the administration you need to make choices about who you are and who our society is and make those choices at the\nLevel of your schools in your churches and your civic organizations even if you are not glued to the news every day\nSo two points here the first is yes I think that's absolutely right and the second point which I think is related to the the comment that I made earlier than it has to be the case and I have to put it in this in this form has to be the case that one is still open to\nAnd willing to listen\nTo contrary information that is to say information opinions that seemed to to bump up against the views that you have and the moment in which\nIn at data opinion attending to views that stand in tension with one's own then we'll we'll be in big trouble and I think that this was one of the hallmarks right of the of the Trump Administration and in many ways in space\nAnd part of what is so damaging about this if in fact it becomes the hallmark of the scenario as such\nAs that the very capacity we need\nIn order to be responsive to the grievances the problems we find ourselves confronting the very capacity that we depend on that is to say the openness the ability to listen to the other side the moment in which that that goes away\nThen democracy is a already dead\nIn these dark times what do you worry about the most\nWhat I worry about the most is that um do we may have been wrong and by implication I'm wrong but I don't worry about that in some kind of um a a sort of self reference to all private land the sense that I Would I Would rather be right all the time and we we all get things wrong\nI worry about this because work to be the case um do we got this wrong then it was largely me that the ideal of democracy or places to great demand on us to honor it\nAnd it may be that democracy places to great of a demand on us not merely because of the ideals that it represents but perhaps because it is far too noble um for us to attain and and that's that's what I worry\nAbout and what gives you hope so what gives me hope\nAgain I think comes from John to be but it's not just John do as a whole tradition\nThe sense in which we as ordinary everyday individuals and that set of style that we are not a fix creatures\nWith a capacity for transformation and for development is so true\nTo who we are as human beings and then in the context of the United states we have actually made that any last his the plasticity the hallmark the foundation of a democratic society and if that's the case\nThen it means that who we seem to be and I'll courage treat but a lot fellows and I'll ... practices of cruelty need that determine who we will look up\nThank you very much like you know in Rogers is an associate professor of political science at Brown his forthcoming book is that dark in light of the race democracy and

violent other years in our history\nAnd violent times in our history but what has really always defined us until this moment is that the people who were struggling believed in American democracy and they believed that the problems that they were seeing where the American democracy was not doing what they wanted it to do\nNow it seems we have a number of people who actually don't believe in American democracy and would like to replace it with something else and how that's going to play out I think is anybody's guess at this moment\nI wanted to ask you a question ... another question

politics\nAbsolutely people don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these

accelerated\nObviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and and even before that a but it it is really accelerated with social media and also I think ah the Internet and social media allows

paper where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts oh a that conveniently arises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact check a little bit of what we just heard the president say there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get eighty five years of benefits or the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and work the job and creates a value for the economy correct\n[noise] well

talking point which is that they thought they were slow to respond to these problems do you feel like you came away understanding why Facebook was slow to respond\n[noise] it was a combination of things it was a combination of the true complexity of dealing with these types of problems\nThat's what a lot of former employees are saying about it that what do you do about misinformation what do you do about the ability of rumors to spread how do you do that at a scale of two point two billion people on your platform these are all really knew really complicated problems and they really

about\nA there's a book that came out I think ... is the author is called Thomas Jefferson's Koran when I first learned that\nThomas Jefferson owned up her on as a Muslim American who grew up I'm just sort of internalizing the idea that America is a Christian country ah it blew my mind just to think about uh\nThe the fact that folks who um were charged with building the framework for governance for

right to religious liberty and the right to to be um a two to believe what they want to believe\nAnd and have a place in this country and so they they did right way than and I think Thomas Jefferson thought with a bit of idealism about religious diversity I think the the really cruel part of this whole story is that um you know ...\n... the founding fathers probably didn't realize that a number of\nSlaves that were forcibly brought into this country\nWe're also Muslim uh and that there was a remarkable religious diversity at this time especially among indigenous communities that were already

volatile but the American economy is solid low unemployment companies hiring interest rates that remain fairly low and September consumer confidence number there was the highest in Eighteen years\nAnd yet if midterm polling is accurate the party in power may not reap the kind of electoral rewards that they usually would when the numbers are this strong some of that has about President Trump and we'll talk about why some of it is also about an economy\nThat still feels precarious to too many Americans and we'll talk about that too\nAnd here's where you come in take a moment to think about how your own household economy feels did you get a raise in the last year or so do you feel confident enough to make a big expenditure on your house\nTire meant because your savings look strong\nSo this is a moment to take stock of your own household economy and maybe use some of the measurements that I've just suggested\nAnd then think along with us and call in I Hope about whether you feel that this economy is benefiting you and how that's influencing the way you're thinking about the mid term election here's the phone number six five one to two seven six thousand\nEight hundred two for two twenty eight twenty eight on Twitter at carry NPR it Margaret Jones is with us She's an economist and host of the sip pod cast\nA more of that sounds very interesting I'll have to listen welcome good to have you had a show\nThank you and you can also watch it All right John failing is with us economist with the center for the American experimenting based here in the twin cities and in the studio John welcome back to to have you on the show it's good to be here John ... if we were to use the objective measure of are you better off financially\nNot emotionally but financially than you were two years ago would most Americans have to say yes to that\nUh the statistics would seem to show that yeah um we've had a increased uh GDP grows in the u._s. um GDP growing at a\nRate accelerate said I'm On the ... and the previous ministry most Americans feel that well they would feed it primarily in terms of wages now if you look at the white data um you'll often see the wages have grown from twenty ... twenty eight to ... percent which sounds pretty bad\nBut once you are correct that a recent report from the council of economic advisers that is\nUm if you look at using more accurate inflation measure if you look at the composition of the workforce or just changing over time ... um than you actually see that it's uh the uh increase in wages would be one percent of the same period I'm a ... ...\nDid this in more detail the go ahead\n... ... that's that's not bad that's not about increased um now of course if you make these adjustments and backwards into the bomber finished ration you see the same thing that ... fasted and guidelines I guess would suggest\nBetween uh in in in squeezing people's living standards\nUm because if you look at the dice that you'll often see a very popular chart that shows productivity gains in Nineteen Seventy three yeah it was just looking at that yeah and ... and why he just kind of ... along right now if you if you again you know if you're correct that the inflation rate inflation measures\nAnd various other things you find an actual facts about Seventy to eighty percent\nOf the increase in productivity seems I think is nine Seventy three does go ah to to work to the workers\nUm because one thing but that doesn't they for example it just looks at why he just doesn't look at you for compensation and one thing that you say is that um compensation benefits fringe benefits health Kevin all the rest of it are increasing portion of work has been ...\nAgain the benefits that we're getting through ... not necessarily salary increases like but go ahead with what you were saying about productivity was\nI think frankly that's the biggest macro policy challenge that he's faced in this country in the states or in other countries um because\nIf you don't have it in economic growth um you know that that stops all sorts of problems and I think you can look at some of the political things that go on\nAnd see them as people being dissatisfied with reasonably saying the economy's hurting people say you know when the pie is growing people don't want me so much about who's getting dislikes and that sliced but once the partial shrinking then it becomes a kind of zero sum game\nAnd people trying to be interested I'm from all at the expense of somebody else now if you ... if you look at 'em you know see every day so they both show your economic uh growth theory invites a boat show you that it's um ... anyway you catch a look I'm an economic growth the stem from productivity increases notes\nJust dumping a in ... when it comes from the increased efficiencies that you use these inputs wave\nMedical to see the inputs themselves that that's where we've kind of you know be be ... about\nI Want to make sure I I kind of interpret what you were saying they're correctly I think when you were alluding to the political environment that we're in and the zero sum game of this\nWhat you mean is ... some of the concern about immigration and are they are going to be enough jobs for Americans to work at ... am I right is that what you let any of\nThat yeah I I don't I wouldn't say that um all these concerns about issues such as immigration or whatever all driven Saudi by people's economic stuff\nThat is an element letting us so it right on it and it and it explains it in some ways in the midst of an economy that's good\nYeah I mean what one thing that one thing I Would say this is a fantastic books few years old now called the moral consequences of economic growth by like Ben Friedman I'm and he looks back over the long history of various countries the U.S France Britain um shows that a political turbulence often comes in the wake of stagnant rising incomes\nConversation here if you've just gotten in on it about how the economy which is a very good one but many Americans are not feeling all that settled they still have this perception of precarious miss about the economy but the numbers look good\nWe're digging into some of those numbers but we're also talking about how that's influencing the way people are thinking now one week one week from today out from making choices again in the mid term election\nFor candidates I mean how does consumer confidence informed that how does your own household budget informed that John failing here with us from the center for the American experiment and him origins both of them are economists and tomorrow Jones with as a former Clinton aide and host of this sip pod cast and I'm hearing from you this morning\nHousehold economy feels about getting a raise about do you feel confident enough to make a big expenditure are you starting to think about retirement but you're feeling really unsettled about what happens next with the stock market in your investment I think that would be\nThat'd be interesting for this conversation today six five one to two seven six thousand\nEight hundred two for two twenty eight twenty eight on Twitter at carry NPR also think it'd be interesting to hear when was the last time you got a pretty decent raise\nI think that's worth talking about two to Emily and even prairie Hi Emily thanks so much for waiting Hi\nHi Carrie thank you ... what does look like for you\n[noise] so in our household we are to working professionals with masters degrees in engineering and working for about eight years now and we're competing in our wages with people that are out sourcing arts edition in India and Czechoslovakia\nAnd so they're paid significantly less than us so we're not seeing big raises that we're anticipating when we started our career mhm also have a young son who was six months old and we're feeling the burden of childcare and says that\nAre greater than our monthly mortgage so we feel unsettled I'm with the economy and even though the numbers are good and moving into the midterm elections it than I guess I'm factor that we're looking at when you vote\nSo this uh this company did did you say that you and your husband are both engineers at the same company\nDifferent company different companies and both companies are outsourcing some of his engineering work overseas significantly\nAre are are you aware of that ...\nOf what's going on in this field yeah I mean I think I'm Dr for tremendous concern out first and has been renewed it out\nAnd there's up to engineering actually saying also legal services um various types of computer programming\nUm which are which are also concerned in the next economic downturn there probably we will be a huge surge like there wasn't automation last time two other new forms of technology which reduced labor costs such as\nUm uh artificial intelligence and robotics so there are lots of ways in which workers\nUm are concerned um and should be concerned I think that all of the some policy standpoint\nUm are things that are not being addressed um\nAnd one of the thing I just wanted to come to us as productivity question you know we know um\nFor instance that a key driver productivity is helping healthcare ... and we know that over the past two years on health outcomes in the United states have stagnated that is to say life expectancy has stagnated\nUm we're even seeing it in a in a decline for various populations um we also know that there's been a halt to H. B. one be one of these as\nI Would help bring people who are talented with unique skills and to the United states those have been um captain and are running out faster and faster we know that there have been curbs to other forms of immigration um there are lots of things which contribute to productivity\nHealth the ability to have lots of people coming into the country that can\nProduce ... the ability to be able to turn people out\nOn in terms of education and we've also seen education cuts be severe across the United states which is why teachers across the country are increasingly getting involved in politics so again even this productivity question I'm which undergrads if you say that well one of the reasons why people are feeling it is because of our productivity in that meeting there\nAre policy reasons under guarding that that translate into a lot of the things that we're hearing on these ... it looks like you agree with that\nThere's a lot of truth in it um I mean put activity\n... you can increase their productivity by giving them more capitals where it was um that will hit diminishing returns you know there's only so many shovels you can give somebody for example um so what you need to do then is to improving improve the capital so instead of giving them a shovel give them a big you know an ... an equal manner\nUm and then you can and the other aspects of that is that you um improve the quality of the workforce in education so I think those are the the key drive is innovation investment in education\nAnd it was quite right these things will are amenable tractable one policy um in terms of investment this is why I think that one of the good things that the administration has done as being the tax cuts and particularly the tax cuts and a U.S corporate tax rate\nWhich was very very high and people always say well do all these exemptions ended up ... trust me America is not the only country in the world has exemptions ended up to ... and other people have them as well so I think that's one good thing that the administration is not ...\nBut I I mean you've heard the debate obviously about who benefited most one of the questions that I have about the tax cuts as it seems like\nMany of these companies that are benefiting from the tax cuts had huge stockpiles of capital all ready and that they were not I mean some of the questions is Ben ... what is it going to take for some of these companies to invest more of that capital that they're holding\nBut I'm ... on that estimate the returns and that will be impacted by the tax cuts and even before\nThis going into the tax cuts go ahead\nOh well I mean I think what they will see now is that if they invest in a certain amount in plans or whatever and they will say I'm a ... ton on that\nI think one of the problems that you have and if you looked at the the dice of full of the core of the year business investment wasn't actually a huge um contribute to the economic growth that we saw um and that's something that\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

Richardson spoke this fall at the Minnesota Historical Society about her book to make men breed a history of the Republican Party you could hear her talk at noon and nine PM\n[noise] I'm Carrie Miller this is NPR News last week the Federal Reserve bank of Minneapolis hosted a conference on innovation in early childhood education\nAre set about the economic benefits of investing in early childhood development kind of tangential to what we were talking about this hour the panel is moderated by our NPR News education reporter Elizabeth shock men and the guess where Mary Brainerd former president and CEO from Minnesota based health partners\n... knew an assistant commissioner and the Minnesota department of education and our role next senior fellow at the Humphrey school of public affairs at the U. of them as their own starts us off talking about his research into the economic benefits of investing in early education\nI wanted um uh the business community in particular\nBut generally the public to think about early childhood development is economic development I had railed against for many years public funding of private companies you don't want to get me started on stadiums but\nFor the last ten plus years the state of spent a billion dollars on building sports stadiums arenas these are private companies they would have done this anyway in some form or another\nAnd probably whats well no not at all he was Amazon headquarters they are going around I think I got twenty communities bidding on that that headquarters I think New Jersey's up to seven billion dollars okay they're going to locate somewhere in the U.S that's no new jobs it's a question of moving them around where they can locate\nSo work Robin I work I mean we got a much better investment than that\nUh we claimed in fact an Eighteen percent inflation adjusted return based on the Perry preschool study ... I'm a at a uh Thirteen percent return but we have double digit returns\nFrom these studies and we're just making a very simple economic arguing we got a much better public investment because most of the return and investing in our most at risk kids the public benefits so the economic argument we thought was pretty straightforward a let's look at the best\nCurrent current workforce because as you build more early ed programs are going to be hiring more teachers et cetera and it's your future workforce so its economic real economic development and it's an economic development that we argued and no one's disagreed with this is Fifteen Years later\nThe best public investment we can make and I argue it'll create more jobs now in in the future then that Viking stadium over there so you want real economic development you want it in the places that need it the most you want to deal with equity issues\nYou can't do better than this is an economic investment the thing I learned the most is this isn't about empowering programs this is about empowering parents\nAnd if you think about the Minnesota model of early childhood education that we've implemented here\nStarts with the parents when we can prenatal with a home visiting nurse maybe ... to another type of current mentor but it's very much the north side of the treatment zone the NASA model in a way to GROW model I should point out that roughly Seventy percent of the kids in Minnesota start school ready\nA poverty kids it's thirty percent historically in the north side of cheese and its own Eighteen percent women or signed a cheap and Fillmore up from Eighteen percent close to sixty percent way to grow is close to Ninety percent\nSo we've got results okay so this isn't theory anymore I Know we can get better\nAnd my points in the political system is not five years from now we don't need more research now is the time to fund this for every child born into poverty for every child born of incarcerated parents for every homeless child we know it's a huge investment huge return on investment for the public\nAnd so hopefully in five to ten years we'll start showing that we can not only a close the achievement gap do this right and health is a big component of this we can prevent it\nDon't characteristics that you're seeing and programs that are really doing\nWith these great results show the programs that work the bashed\nStart with an earlier the better chance dark and so that's the heavy lifting them or it's not just simply taking a child and putting them it's freaky this is really about the sustainable results you get their parent if you give me an engaged engage in a powered parents\nAnd we may not get it All right we're not going to go too far well what\nCan you add to that Mary what have you learned about and I'm kind of coming around empowering parents investing as I really liked that phrase that art side not investing in a program investing in parents investing and people\nFirst I completely agree with arts points and I think what I Would do is is add\nUm first of all preschool is incredibly important\nBut the time before preschool is incredibly important and there are knowledge gaps all the professionals who deal with tiny children don't know the science\nParents don't work in California would say that's a big gap is young moms just don't know how critical those first three years of life are for brain development\nAnd so if we wait 'til age three were actually waiting too long which is why this earlier part of the program that are talking about is so important and that can be delivered a lot of different ways but we know\nThat when families have a I had a new baby they want that baby to do well\nThey want good things for their child and sometimes just don't know that the experiences that a child has in the first year of life\nReally set the course for their future life success and I think understanding that critical nature of that time and that we're talking about not rocket science kinds of interventions we're talking about smuggling and cuddling and\nThings that make a huge difference to a child's future\nAnd we just haven't helped parents see that all the time so I think that's a thing I Would emphasize it's where health care can make some difference because we see lots of families lots of times during her pregnancy and the early months after a child is born\nBut churches do too\nAnd other child care organizations do too and schools do too and community organizations do too and I sometimes think one of the things that's currently standing in the way is there's a lot of fragmentation so approaches that help parents make decisions and get connected\nReally important that's one of the strengths of NASA's making those connections\nIt's where you'd like to see huge scale implementation of things that we know\nCan help you know ending remarks on this topic\nI just say there are for things that UNICEF calls out worldwide as indicative of a country that is committed to kids one is support for breastfeeding\nAnd we're doing better on that but we're not doing nearly as good a job as we could in supporting breastfeeding for moms [noise]\nThe second is making sure that families have six month parental leave that's happening lots of places not happening here [noise]\nThe third one is making sure that all kids data is used to identify kids at high risk and making sure that there's an intervention to support those kids that's arts point\nAnd we're not really doing that very reliably either and then the fourth point is making sure that kids have universal access to two years of pre K education\nSo I are very many countries doing that no but are some countries doing parts of that yes\nZero for I think that's something we need to change for our future and it's ... it's why for me it's gotta be knowledge awareness social change an action\nI'm going to go back to something Mary said about um access to to programs access to resources and I'm a how complex that can sometimes be I'm way that the Minnesota office of the legislative auditor recently found that\nMinnesota's um early childhood programs where complex and fragmented I'm\nThe child of a preschooler who've tried to figure out what's available out there I can concur I it can be confusing how are you thinking about this um how are you

H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learned more ed E. H. R. go dot com powerfully\nAs in the Republican Party\nSo when you walk you through this a little bit the early years first of all\nAmericans believe that there was not a contradiction between these two concepts that of equality and that of property because they had this extraordinary land out to the west if you remember one of the reasons the colonists were upset with the government back in England was that have declared that Americans could not move across the Appalachian Mountains\nAnd it cut off all that western land\nThe Congress under the articles of confederation passes the northwest ordinance when it realizes the problems that are happening in Kentucky with a monopoly ... monopoly invasion of the land and the government by these rich men who make their money from a on their plantations through slave labor\nAny slave in those territories is property so by definition under the Dred Scott decision all of those territories are going to become slave territory\nAnd once they get broken up into states and of course at the time it looks like there's going to be a lot of western states because who knew we were going to make such giant states out there\nThe free states are going to be completely over awed by the slave states both in the house of representatives and in the Senate and it's only a question of time into slavery becomes national [noise]\nThat's what we're talking about and we're talking about the ...\nFeeling of that's it we're going to become an oligarchy of this fabulously of these fabulously wealthy man who are going to make the rules for everybody else and once that happens do you think there's any chance are going to give us equality of opportunity\nIn Eighteen fifty eight in the Senate\nJames Henry Hammond answered that question with a speech that come down through history as a cotton news kings beach but it ought to be the mud so speech called the month so speech because in that speech James Henry ham and laid out the vision of a slave holder in eight the late Eighteen fifties\nAnd it's a vision is going to be picked up and the cornerstone speech by Alexander Stevens in an aging sixty one\nAnd in it he says lessen\nWorld is made up mostly of drugs is what he calls me ... people and most of those are the uh if you know your prairie history there the pieces of wood that are driven into the ground before concrete I'm\nDriven into the ground deeply enough that they hit 'em a dry bed so that you can build a house on top of it\nSo they are literally driven into the mud to support what's above them\nAnd he says she'll get materials they're not very smart they don't care they just want physical pleasures they need to be directed by their batters in order to move society forward because what that does is those people at the bottom produce a lot\nAnd they um they ... if you if you let them actually have any of it they're going to waste it in like food and drink and you know housing 'em but [noise] if you let it accumulates if you let the people above you know people like me I'm accumulate fat money\nWe use it for\nChuck Haitian and to direct the economy in such a way that it brings benefits for everybody and we take care of those people at the bottom and they're loyal to us and the problem he says is that\nFirst of all you northerners make the mistake of believing that crap about everybody being equal because everybody's not equal some of us really are better than others and the problem in the north you let those people vote\nAnd if you let them vote they're going to want more of what they produce and if they get more of what they produce they're not going to be able to ... the society is going to stagnate\nBecause you're not going to be able to get those concentration of wealth and an education of connections and the the networks around the world that are going to enable us to move society forward you are literally going to destroy society if you let these months ills participate in their government\n[noise] that's the exact same argument that Alexander Stevens is going to make in a corner has a very famous cornerstone speech in which he says\nThe confederacy is the wave of the future we have refine that crazy idea that men are created equal they're not\nWe're better than other people and we are sacrificing ourselves to create this new forward looking society that's an ideology that's a mindset and that's where people like James Henry Hammond were in the Nineteen fifties and James Henry Hammond is a fascinating character\nGoing to give you a little bit on him um because his mindset I think is illustrated in part by his behavior\nHe was famous for bullying he's famous for his outbursts and his temper um and he was also infamous for raping not only his slaves um he kept to a a slave woman and her daughter and then later\nKeep the slaves in the family I Can't free them a because it would just make them miserable I'm but let's make sure that only our family owns my children [noise]\nUm but he also raped us four nieces who were the daughters of weighed Hampton which if you know you're southern history like a lot I can think of the equivalent um he was the wealthiest man in the south and in his diary because he recorded all the um gym to him and blamed the girls\nUm for for coming on to him for a for ruining his career which took a about twelve\nYears they wouldn't let him back into the Senate um because but then they did so um but that personality I think is is the last ...\nSo too did Abraham Lincoln think it was the last ... in Eighteen fifty nine in Milwaukee, Wisconsin he responds directly to James Henry handling\nAnd this speech really matters because in it he takes on that ... says there's some people out here I think that some people are better than others and the the way you move society for is to accumulate wealth with the top and keep everybody else down\nAnd remember Abraham Lincoln was one of those ... cells when his family moved to Indiana they literally\nCould not afford a fourth wall on their house that's where they kept the fire but they were played by squirrels\nAnd lights on all the things like that and he worked as a day laborer and he was actually quite well known as a fighter I mean he was a physical fighter those long arms help and um and he was one of those ... cells that James Henry Hammond who is raping his nieces\nSays is not good enough to make decisions about his own future\nAnd Abraham Lincoln looks at their said he said no that's one way to look at the world but but we disagree with that people think like me say that the the people at the bottom hard workers are the ones we're all the new id\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

turn to employ the people above them and they in turn employ a few finance fears and industrialists who will in turn it start people at the bottom it's going to create this\nCycle of prosperity that it's uniquely American because of how many um how much have how many resources the ... the American west especially but that America has and it's going to create a cycle of prosperity that will continue until every bag or in the country is equipped with a coach and four\nAnd this is true genius of America\nBut it depends on the guys at the bottom having a say in the way they're governed\nWell you know how this plays out an Eighteen sixty the Republicans who now have found a champion and found a language for what they believe in not just what they stand against they run Abraham Lincoln for the White House and when he wins an Eighteen sixty southerners a southern leaders by the way\nNot regular southerners who at this point or not supporting the the leadership which itself is an interesting story that I really don't have time to tell you about\nBut southern leaders declare that the south is going to preserve its system of oligarchy fickle slavery by creating a new nation and by destroying the old United States of America\n[noise] well this is the this new party and a bizarre position they've got this leader who's a bump gun\nFor the first one that tries to take advantage of his height and to emphasize that he's something different as opposed to the ones that tried to hide had different he was ready to put them in a ... it was too small so you could see how big his hands were for example\nUm which and be and yet the rest of them on a book um there's a lot going on in his portrait but you've got this back would bump Ken\nIn the presidency\nAt the head of a party that has no idea what it's doing\nSo it's always hold them a lot of of people from other parties but they don't really know what they believe in yet and all of a sudden they have to fight this war\nIs worth going to take over a million men it's going to create in the army in the navy is going to raise more than six billion dollar billion ... billion dollars and these are all things that are unsinkable an Eighteen sixty one\n[noise] but for our purposes today the other thing that the Republican Party does is it puts teeth into the idea that the government really should create equality of opportunity for people at the bottom\nAnd the Republicans very deliberately continued construction on the Capitol building despite the fact they were terribly short of money during the war because they recognize that people were looking at them to create a new nation\nAnd then if you stopped creating that that building it was a sign about what was happening to the nation so they do a number of things first of all they passed the homestead act which puts regular Americans on land simply for their willingness to live on it and work on it [noise] they also passed the department of agriculture\nGrant and they he and his friend Carl shirts down hair color shirts who's from Missouri and um spend time in Wisconsin they are looking for some way to a ... to attack the very popular grant\nAnd they buy into this idea that the Republicans were using the government that his protecting African Americans only to get themselves re elected\nThe idea of corruption that this is somehow looking quite a bit like what happened in the Paris Commune these people are redistributing wealth they are conscious\nIf you search the New York times Eighteen Seventy one word socialist communist are\nEverywhere it is not a twentieth century phenomenon in America so not modern day communism marks is writing now but he hasn't taken on any where this is way pre Lenin and all that but actually marks commented on the civil war and wrote a letter to Lincoln when he won and sixty four but um but they pick up that language\nTo attack grants\nNow crush or had a protege who clearly\nAdmired shirts Joseph Pulitzer uh the protege of Carl shirts this goes into the American newspaper system\nUm throughout the rest of the century meanwhile grant has to do something about the fact he's got this revolt in his own party and the teams up with [noise] the handsome man in the nineteenth century as he is no [noise] Roscoe constantly\nRuns New York in order to to win New York you have to win New York city against that tweed ring and you have to win New York to win the\nPresidency because New York has thirty five electoral votes compared to anybody else in the country ah Pennsylvania is the next closest with twenty nine most states have very very few so the Republican\nJumps on board this anti African American anti immigrant train in order to retain the support of Wall Street\nAnd the party quite deliberately switches from being the party of Lincoln to adopting this language of anti uh anti at this racial and as you know phobic language anti labor language to becoming the party of big business JD Rockefeller\nCongress and um and having an owning the White House and this is the Arab by the Eighteen eighties where Congress belongs to the rich guys this is the era when literally senators called themselves a senator for the sugar trust or the senator for the ... trust\nAnd they believe that this is the way it was supposed to be by the Eighteen eighties you get the Republican Party time itself to this concept that originally had been\nAdvanced by people like James Henry Hammond the idea\nThat um you could either on the ... the country with a few rich guys in charge or with the mob but the there was no compromise to be had and he says very famously this is a businessman's administration\nAnd the businessmen are going to be very happy with it Benjamin Harrison by the way was a lost the popular vote by a hundred thousand votes but got put into office by a trick in the electoral college [noise]\nUm people forget that Eighteen Ninety two before the homestead strike very deliberately stage to say is this really a quality is this man here in the bowler hats really equals Andrew Carnegie\nAnd this obviously is designed to say no and of course on the heels of this we get the panic of Eighteen Ninety three and a great financial disaster\nSo when I'm sitting up here at great length and I'm gonna go much quicker here uh to get you through the rest of the century is this pattern of the government the Republican Party being designed to protect equality of opportunity\nVenice tripping over the problem of the fact that that cost tax dollars\nSo that idea weekends under an onslaught of racism and xenophobia and later sexism and the party ties self to big business and creates an economic crash so me walk you through that\nTeddy Roosevelt and Bob ... for example take a look at fighting Bob La Follette from Wisconsin take a look at what's happening around them in the Eighteen eighties and nineties and\nSee this is not what Lincoln stood for and Teddy Roosevelt of course both of them are huge fans of Lincoln\nAnd they begin to argue that in fact the idea of the ... the government once again should protect equality of opportunity\nAnd they change the idea of liberalism from the idea that a liberal government comes from the idea of John Locke that the government must be kept small in order to keep it from a pressing the individual they begin to argue that in fact the opposite is true that the government must regulate\nA business in order to create equality of opportunity for everybody and it's during the early years of Teddy Roosevelt presidency that the concept of liberalism goes from small government to big government\nBoth with the idea of protecting individual ...\nThey're fighting uphill they produce the progressive era which gives us some of our early legislation but of course you have the rise of anti immigrant I'm great anti immigrant sentiment an anti African American sentiment and yet the KKK in the Nineteen twenties was focused largely on immigrant population\nBecause the African American population is already on the ropes the popularity of the clan in Nineteen twenty five meanwhile businessmen incest in this period\nThat the country's communist and it's one of my favorite quotes in American history and this is um the guy who gets involved in a teapot dome in which he says a majority of the college professors in the United states are teaching socialism and bullshit isn't\nA Thompson is teaching bullshit businessmen he may yet convert Lamont of J. P. Morgan and company vendor looked as a ... he's a banker\nSo is Charles are crane who went on to become a fascist so the bar for being a socialist here he's really really really long [noise]\nUm

progressive era and World War one destroys the progressive legislation\nAnd untrue Andrew under Andrew Mellon\nUm weakens a provides a lot of kickbacks to um to businessmen and populate the government with business as opposed to with the regulators who are supposed to be overseeing business and he says the government for now it's going to help business rather than trying to regulate it\nAnd of course we very famously have Calvin Coolidge saying the business of America is business which he never said\nHe said something like that but that's apocryphal and finally we get Herbert Hoover who is elected by a landslide in Nineteen twenty eight who says that the government must stay out of the economy\nBecause the idea of regulating in providing quality of opportunity for people at the bottom was the same philosophy of government which has poisoned all of Europe\nThe fumes do which is called ... which boiled\nIn Russia or the party of the mob\nThank God we still have a government in Washington which knows how to deal\nWith mom [noise]\nWe know what happened October of Nineteen twenty nine we get the great crash and we get the depression and we get the rise of ... of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who recreate a version of a Lincoln's vision of the government protecting equality of opportunity and providing a base he as a basic social safety net to that and that's the new deal\nThat's the new deal state what became called the liberal consensus that goes into the post war years it is designed to create\nThat's equality of opportunity and a very famous image from Nineteen forty nine\nFrom this remember boys and girls your school like our country is made up of Americans of many different races religions and national origins so if you hear anybody talk against a schoolmate or anyone else because of his religion race or national origin\nThat kind of talk is on American\nDwight Eisenhower of course believes in there's liberal state the liberal consensus the new deal state he doesn't like the FDR has gone after business quite as much as he has and he creates its own new vision of this called the middle way\nAnd he takes the Republican Party into a version of the new deal state that promotes equality of opportunity and yet pulls back a little bit on the regulations that FDR has put in place over business it's worth remembering\nThat Eisenhower a oversaw the\nLargest infrastructure system in American history and also he refused to lower the war\nTaxes that had the upper income tax bracket in America at Ninety One percent because he said I can how

citizenship they argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying well Republican\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House his critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get\nDoes she plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections um although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that the sushi will motivate voters on the other side as well\n... stopping people from voting and so the idea that we all have one vote and we all have the ability to make that choice is of who represents sides\nIf that becomes to separate and oh morals and ethics become separate\nIt's run by Marcia Zimmerman of temple Israeli

sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty eight teams it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle kneeling\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio

H R go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learned more ed E. H. R. go dot com [noise]\nWhy why\nWe can only and that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Rebekah Brooks brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice there's would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing ...\nI actually Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nLike I get up relationships in the middle of it because I Lived in the ... and the other police officers say something\nLife will he fits the profile\nAnd I'm like my dad used to my brother's history there were all star game we use ...\nLike everyday and in the profile\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything reveal Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nIs all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California\nMaking her own ... to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia\nAfrican American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of\nIt well black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American\nAt the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was unimpressed Lee in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day that the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation

somebody who's been monitoring gap for a while now before it was taken down how do people on dad react to the synagogue shooting\n[noise] there was a range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nIn the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the ...\nThere was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks after the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour bus again went on a media spree asking\nFor users and explicitly tied this then to the white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with Twitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms\nThat you wouldn't suffer the same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements and want to\nPlay a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gab CEO Andrew tour but about ... hours post when he said specifically the words I'm going and\nWould you expect us to do with those like that you want us to censor anybody that's a phrase on going in that what you're proposing hair and here's the thing he answered the bad or a beach or we wanted to find that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this referral\nYeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with troll cereal harasser as people generally opt out\nNot many people go on line to defend against these kinds of post that gets served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is\nOur Web hosting companies payment company's apps stories they've all cut ties with gap and yet gab in a tweet estimates Italy I've been writing by this weekend how likely is that well I Can't tell you exactly how likely\nIt is that there'll be able to replace their servers their domain their payments servicing and use the features that they are accustomed to serving to their audience but what we do now is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure\nAre backing out of these partnerships and I don't know if they're going to find companies that are willing to take the risk to their reputation to be known as\nSupporters of gap\nJoined on it and is with data and society a research Institute in New York City

fundraising and spending in state races so governor attorney general\nThis year for the record books and those contests alone more than forty four million dollars has been spent so far by candidates

most expensive races and there are several into well into six figures already are in the suburbs and involve seats now held by Republicans\nKeep in mind that most Minnesota house candidates are limited to spending about sixty five to eighty five thousand dollars in spending on their own racist\nSo the parties and outside groups they're taking over\nSo those are the legislative races let's look at the top of the ticket races the race for Minnesota governor what is the what are the numbers look like\nThey're it's another case the DFL being better positioned democratic nominee Tim Walz is outraged Republican Jeff Johnson by about one point five million dollars to this campaign walls also had more money in the bank for the final two weeks\nBut democratic allies are also overwhelming their counterparts on the Republican side Jeff Johnson has been pounded by for a million dollars in ads on line and on TV from one group alone there's another nearly three million dollars from a separate pro walls group\nBy comparison the main Republican group on TV against walls to spend about one point seven five million dollars it's nothing to scoff at but still shy of the Democratic effort\nThe attorney general's race what are the numbers look like they're\nUnlike anything we've seen before both DFL or Keith Ellison and Republican Doug war do have raised a lot were outraged Alison in the last month but Ellison has more money saved up and the DFL party has invested one million dollars in this race and the first few weeks of October alone\nAnd eighty percent of that has been used to go after ward though who's better position than any Republican in the last fifty years to win the job\nAnyone is watch T.
