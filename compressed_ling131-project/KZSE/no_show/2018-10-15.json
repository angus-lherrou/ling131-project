why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings did get better for

something that he's been saying at those rallies listen to this\nWho are saying I might sit out the midterms not this time so what does that portend do you think for control of the house if that poll is accurate three weeks out\nWell everything I've seen and of course this is not a national election these are individual races for the house\nBut everything seems seems to indicate that the Democrats do have enough seats they need to pick up a net gain of twenty three and ... with a record number of Republicans are retiring with a with a record number of uh uh women running you know uh for for Congress um\nBut he did not see this ... this is he is writing that ... and he is always believed that the president is a quote force for destruction\nBut he's also writing that it's undeniable that President Trump has delivered on a lot of the Republican agenda to age ... Supreme Court confirmations the nap changing the NAFTA deal although it didn't change that much the Iran deal the Paris climate deal\nI mean maybe this accounts for some of the loyalty the GOP voters feel for him oh there's no\nThat Donald Trump is delivered on a lot of what he promised and you mentioned two Supreme Court nominations would not to mention dozens I think two two dozen maybe two or three dozen\nFederal ... judicial appointments around the country which is the most in presidential history for a president and his in his two years of the term so all the all the things he promised\nConservative jurors are ending of an unfair trade deals a more aggressive foreign policy and a better economy look look I'm not going to say that that this economy is because of Donald

next thing\nYou know I I can say before I form I mean I\nIt was a conversation I was having with a friend in another state and they were um going through some issues at their company and so I started actually working with her and she said you know I've learned more from you on this particular topic\nThan I had learned it all those workshops we went to we pay a thousand dollars you should think about teaching the huh\nYeah that's actually what we do today if you and me and I write so no I I completely hear what she's saying that's how it happened for us some time to do I wasn't looking for

right how will I pay the mortgage da da da da da da da da da da\nDa in fact I mean what Debbie is finding is is based on narrow science that when she started studying something else started meeting new people walking you know working in different circles\nAs she started this her brain lit up I mean she got a new purpose in life in many ways and that's really what you see you have to push through kind of the sound barrier\nTo get to the other side but then your brain will tell you wow that was a really really good decision I'm happy now call here from Amanda in Minneapolis Amanda you're going through this right now yes\nAm and you know I I got to find it so hard with is um [laughter] it's kind of amazing I think one thing that\nThat is valuable hear this conversation is considering how a lot of us come out of high school and we are very young and any kind of get\nThrown into adulthood and you have to make decisions okay I Need a job they need to head in a direction I Need to go to school I personally went into the military and search for years and the army and realized very quickly that\nThat was not funny um and so uh being that I was getting out and I needed to make the next decision I was I was still feeling that pressure to be at an adult and get into a career and get into a job so I ... and\nAh it took me you know into my late twenties early thirties trivialize\nI gotta stop making these decisions really quickly and I need to take time to really think about what do I want to do with the rest of my life and not to say that I'm nursing has it been incredible\nChanging and I've learned a lot about myself and I've gained some incredible skills\nBut what I realized over the past\nThree years or so is that people had been noticing at least are equality is and now I'm In the middle of transitioning out of nursing\nAnd into something that I think is going to be a lot better for any long term that's going to be um uh the right choice for me and that's actually going to be Oregon I Am looking into dealing organizing and I just started a job six months ago and\nThat is an organizing job is my first one and so I'm In the midst of it\nAnd

Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paul the page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. veal AM radio back in July is part of what means governor said\nOr one thing I Know there's no way they can force me to put the state and reading and I will not do that to tell them to go to jail before I put the ... the stage rhetoric and their staff to court tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nThat's part of Maine Governor Paula page speaking back in July now read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feet or I mean how's this going to end well\nA ... page is a he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh he was the\nLoud and and bombastic candidate in a one two races that uh uh he probably shouldn't have won in the political sending that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came into shake up the old order and that's what voters elected in foreign uh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters I'm In the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point Paula pages turn out this year or the Democratic candidate is leading in in most of the surveys that ah that that up there um but\nAs a consequence of all the pages actions there are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have\nThe health care that they that they need and this is a it's a problem in Maine especially in a communities that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages and pretty dangerous jobs and\nUh you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs and issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with dozens of states pass laws this year the aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you\nWe spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about isn't about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the ... paid the retail price of the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would've been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers Kennedy and for their democratic state law\nWould ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with their with their pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because of that is consistently one of the big complaints we hear from our constituents on a on a regular basis as\nHow expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this\nIt is

A. M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question from months in law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support\nIs that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible\nWell of course the people who have an employer plans for the high tech our our our big problem in the lower income people of those have a particular large ...\nSupport comes from urban home works stable homes offer long term positive effects on families consider joining the stability makers a group of donors who believe in the power of equitable undignified homes for everyone urban home works dot org backslash donate\nIt was those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get 'em medicated people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big deductibles so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth between Medicaid and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plans that they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere to eat sidebar for just a second let me to the point of the series is to talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned what simple set of health care costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and there needs to be versatility\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going Julie\nActually it's where it's going is back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all the sort of small incremental changes that the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended to create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states still do an enormous amount of ...\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from the ...

public media about the challenges facing our democracy\nThis is the democracy test Trump truth politics and power I'm Neal Conan\nAnd I'm headed Cox Richardson election to the central mechanism of democracy in theory it works because the people decide on candidates ballot issues and so on its elections that give governments their mandates and their legitimacy\nBut there is an important distinction here\nThe way it actually works out it's not the people who decide its voters and those can be two very different groups\nAt the establishment of the republic voters included only white male landowners obviously the right to vote the franchise has expanded considerably over the years but the history of American politics is a story of this in franchise meant as well systematic and deliberate exclusions that continue to the present day\nCare only understand is a professor of African American studies at Emory University her books include white rage and most recently one person no vote\nSay she joined us from a conference room there at Emory welcome to the democracy test Carol Oh thank you so much for having me Heather so we'll get\nHistory in a minute but you described for women I remember the whole problem of making sure that you're official name match the name under which you voted in of course only women whose names tend to change when they're adults I've always thought that was fascinating example\nIt was just like being down at the um Georgia version of the bureau of motor vehicles and watching women come in with all of these documents only to be turned away because of the documents aren't lining up with who they say they are\nAnd what makes this so infuriating is that all of this mess about voter id is predicated on a lie the lie of voter fraud the lie of massive rampant voter fraud\nAnd that lie has consistently been targeted at the city's saying that in the cities we have people who are\nImpersonating other people and voting multiple times they're voting from using vacant lots as addresses their you know coming under dead people's names and voting and\nYou tell a lie enough times that it begins to sound like the truth and that's where we are right now so predicated on the lie of voter fraud\nFully gain access to the vote particularly in the south where over half\nOf the black population lift and so when you earlier asked about voting rights in the history of voting rights and how we love to have well we will be called this kind of wish sense of of just as progress this wonderful\nProgress that is not always the case the right to vote has been heavily contested and even in the implementation of voter IDs that issue of your last name\nHas become a stumbling block for many women because the name on their birth certificate doesn't match the name that they currently have\nAnd trying to pull all of that documentation together\nIs difficult in Indiana\nAnd then one of their voter id law suits a woman came forward who talked about how many times she had to go to the department of vehicles and never had the appropriate number or types of identification to be able to get the driver's license so that she could vote\nAnd you know that's a really important distinction between the idea that women are going to be radicals and therefore shouldn't have a vote versus the idea that women are going to vote like their husbands and therefore should have the vote\nAnd it's interesting to me that the suffrage movement in the early twentieth century women were very careful to dressed in white and to push their babies in their suffrage parades and to talk about how they were good American citizens and they were supporting their husbands and that's the era in which they get the vote and in fact women\nDo tend to vote like their husbands until the gender gap begins in Nineteen eighty that's when we get the beginning of the gender gap\nAnd it's growing ever since until it is now at the largest it's ever been in American history which is I think one of the reasons that people are don't quite know what to do with the day's politics because women are not behaving the way they have in the past and no one quite knows what's gonna happen with that you mean this women\nBehaving badly thing\nWhere women differently saying yes [laughter]\nRight you know that this kind of thing going you know what we should get equal pay for equal work what we should have control over our bodies\nThe protections that when our our rights and our bodies are violated that the system works as well for us as it does for those\nWho are doing the violating equality before the law [laughter] oh my gosh\n[laughter] and and and if you were absolutely seeing that right now frankly\nI'm with this Kavanaugh debacle you've talked about a lot of different things that go into voter suppression what worries you the most what's the most important it all\nTies together I think the one that I find the most pernicious because it's the most hidden is gerrymandering um earlier you had talked about the redrawing of these districts and of course the redrawing of the districts is constitutionally mandated\nAnd it's supposed to be done by a legislative body after the the senses to take into account the population shifts and so that we get the kinds of a portion meant\nFor the number of representatives that each state should have in the U.S Congress except the way that it's been done and I mean we started out I mean Patrick Henry gerrymandered to try to to keep James Madison out of the U.S Congress and so\nWe've got a long nasty mean history of of gerrymandering but what has happened\nSince then after the ... election it took on a kind of\n... it's it's like on anabolic steroids or something I'll talk about Wisconsin and because it's representative of what's going on around this nation\nIn Wisconsin after the twenty ten election a handful of Republicans basically sequestered themselves away in a hotel and using powerful computer driven mapping\nDraw the districts the congressional and the legislative districts they had two goals one was to eliminate as much as possible the number of competitive districts\nSo they were packed as many Republicans as possible into one district in as many Democrats as possible into another\nYes to do that in a way so that you'd have disproportionate populations in a district\nBut also what happens with non competitive districts are people feel like the game as rigged it doesn't matter if I'd vote or not vote because they're going to win anyway and so people stay home they're demoralized that's what non competitive districts do they drive\nI'm a depression in voter turnout\nThe second goal for the Republicans was to say that regardless of how many votes they received\nThey would always get the majority of seats in the state legislature now I Know that that sounds backwards for the way that a democracy works regardless of how many votes we will always get the majority the maps\nThat they drew they were powerful maps to the point where no Democrats were allowed in the process at all\nAnd the Republicans who weren't in that room we're only allowed to see their district but they had to find a nondisclosure agreement in order to see that district in the twenty twelve election using these newly drawn maps Democrats received fifty two percent of the vote\nAnd gained thirty nine percent\nOf the seats in the state legislature\nTo be fair or Republicans would argue the Democrats did pretty much the same thing in a state like Maryland it's just this Republican control more states the Democrats due to the point\nTerm elections projections are that if Democrats hope to win control of the house of representatives or they have to win something like fifty six fifty seven percent of the vote\nExactly that kind of imbalance does violence to the constitutional concept of one person one vote\nAnd where it also does violence is that because of the ways these districts have been drawn like in Pennsylvania where Republicans receive forty nine percent of the vote but Seventy two percent\nOf the congressional seats is that it has put somewhere between sixteen to twenty six additional GOP seats in Congress and it's created these kind of rotten boroughs where\nPoliticians are able to choose their electorate instead of the electorate choosing them and so they are immune in some ways from the will of the voters\nAnd you talked about dispiriting voters who don't bother to turn out these various things you'd go to register to vote and time and time again you turned away 'cause you don't have the right documentation and all these different mechanisms they act to corrode democracy to destroy people's faith in what's going\nYes exactly I'll take Ohio for instance I'm an early voting was put in place to try to expand access to the voter booth\nBecause having elections on a Tuesday in November that's generally your work day for a lot of folks and so being able to to get to vote and then get to work when you've got to punch the clock is very difficult\nSo early voting provides access to people particularly working class people\nTo be able to fully participate in American democracy what uh\nBooks equitable Ohio said we will have one early voting site for each county wow each county gets one except the counties are very different ah Cuyahoga County\nLoose right Cuyahoga River on Cleveland's God our county right exactly a has one point two five million people that some big county\nWhat happens then is that you have a line for hours long lines in these big county's like Franklin County with Columbia Columbus and Hamilton County uh with Cincinnati\nAnd people are able to just fly through in these smaller counties what they did in North Carolina for instance and Mecklenburg county where Charlotte is\nAnd Charlotte has about seven hundred and fifty thousand people and Fifteen Percent of the states ... black population lives there\nThey reduce the number of early polling sites from twenty two\nTo four twenty two to four\nAnd the Republicans say they sent out a little note congratulating themselves because by strangling early voting sites this way they're like wow and the twenty sixteen or election in early voting there were like\nAfrican American early voter turnout is down by eight point five percent yes I mean how do you congratulate yourself for denying American citizens the right to vote\nCarolyn Anderson thank you very much thank you Neal thank you so much\nTo the IRS the first time he ever heard about any of this was three days\nWhen a postcard that was essentially coming from one of his opponent she wanted to knock them out of the primary race\nBasically compared to in two famous serial murder John Wayne Casey because John had voted for gets in the weeds a little bit of the cloture motion to actually have a discussion about the death penalty\nI'm so him a voting to discuss the death penalty got I'm acquainted with John Wayne Casey and uh when that happens three days before a primary election with a small race for state Senate\nIt's really hard to fight back and he was completely blindsided he didn't know where the attacks were coming from\nFigure out where the money was coming from that was paying for these groups in what motivation they had other and then they just didn't want John to be in the Senate\nSo yes she was she was knocked out of the race and that became kind of the canary in the coal mine those groups got even more aggressive in two thousand and ten\nAnd then with the passage of Citizens United it really took the lid off of the ability for these nonprofit organizations to port unlimited money into campaigns and\nEver since two thousand and ten it's just been you know everybody's off to the races and the actual amount that of dark money is being spent in our elections has just done has just become a\nTorrent so it actually costs a lot less in a sense to buy a state legislature than it does to by Congress so it's cheaper to buy a state legislature through these five oh one C. for nonprofits and get them to do with the state level what you're hoping to do with the national level is that the way it plays out\nIn a lot of ways yeah it's it sort of a bottom up approach in what we found\nBut but there's a a national group that was called the national right to work committee\nThat was setting up from groups in Montana so some of the mysteriously named groups that like for example the one that was it attacking John Ward was name as mothers against child predators and I don't know ... that doesn't strike you\nAt first blush is something that has to do is right to work legislation um but it turned out that that's really what ultimately they where\nThey were after so by setting up to use a false front groups that are so misleading you can't even determine what political policy that really gunning for\nIt just becomes a a very confusing thing for these legislators are running for office and something that's really impossible to defend against\nOne thing that states can do is to emphasize how much disclosure needs to happen you know ... who who are the funders behind these groups\nUm there's a lot of ways that states can mandate that all of this information is put on line very quickly so that voters can know where this money is coming from before the elections happened\nWhen one of the things that I think it's really important to know when you're talking about this and about the dark money coming in is that it's targets are not simply Democrats as targets are Democrats and Republicans anybody who seems to be considered too moderate and not really with the movement conservative agenda you want to talk a little bit more about that\nYeah you know the basic architecture of our film is watching Republicans to some describe them as moderate all although I I mean these guys are pretty conservative\nRepublicans it's not like these are these are squishy Republicans that we're talking to ... no not at all\n... you know Republicans but they're attacked by a people within their own party that just feel like they don't represent the\nThe ideals that they want their Republican Party has so we're looking at this Internet seen Donald within the Republican Party that's not to say that it's only ... Republicans who are involved in dark money spending\nActually over the course of the six years that it's taken me to make this phone\nI think you have to be fair and admit that this dark money spending was really developed and I would say weaponized at the federal level by the political right but more and more I'm seen this money spent on the political left for example in the nomination fight for judge Kavanaugh\nThere was a bunch of money spent by five oh one C. four group she advocate for the\nNomination of a judge Kavanaugh\nBut there was also another group it's that sprang up to oppose that and it did so by using a five on she for dark money group it's important you noticed a couple of things with that one is\nJust this very basic fact that ... when we're talking about dark money spending we're not just talking about candidates running for elected office that we're also talking about judicial nominations and sometimes elections\nAnd so let's think about how dark money function in those judicial nominations\nI don't know who spent money to get Kavanaugh nominated you don't know who spent money to get happened on nominated but she answers are cabinet I'll probably knows who's spent money to get cabin on nominated and how are we ever to\nKnow whether there should be a recusal in a case that comes before him how do we know if there was any sort of\nProgramming is supported by near or a new kind of precision pain clinic pinpoints paying at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing nearer clinics dot com\nSpeaking to follow the money you're you even argue in the film that\nCampaign finance was at the heart of the greatest political drama of our of I'd buy my lifetime anyway and you may be younger than me and that's what I did [noise]\nThat's right the former FCC chairman and unravel a tells the story about you know even the most people\nRemember Watergate as a probably probably through the lens of all the President's Men are for good reason\nBut why don't get really started and ended as a campaign finance scandal it started with your suitcases full of cash on the floor of the oval office or that we're there to pay off the people who broke into the Watergate hotel\nAnd the whole mechanism\nThat they had to buy these people off was hiding money a that was coming from political contributions so it really was a dark money scandal\nAnd the whole campaign finance system that we're dealing with today really came about because it was such public outcry against this sort of corruption\nBut once again we're talking about ways to hide money in political campaigns and if folks are looking for for hope these days and times said um I think there's a lot of people on all sides at the ... really frustrated with ... with our political system and how polarized things are\nThere was a lot of reform that came about in the wake of Watergate and um if if you're looking for help I think it's it's not unreasonable\nThe ... and and be preparing ourselves for another wave of reform in the wake of the corruption that we're hearing about today Thanks very much thank you so much for having me you've really reached film is called dark money\nHeather we've spent a lot of this hour in the Jim Crow south and dark money Montana I wanted to put voting rights and consent of the government into some intellectual and historical context where do these ideas come from well the oldest goes\nAll the way back to what we were talking about at the very beginning of this series with Danielle Alan ... and light ... concept of consent of the Gulf War and the idea that maybe the universe or God or whomever did not deliberately put some men on earth better than others\nBut maybe there aren't people who really should run the government should control the way everybody else lives\nAnd during the enlightenment we get the concept that may be all men are created equal maybe people really should have the right to consent to their government well if that's the case\nThen if everybody is equal how do you decide what sort of policy should work\nThe idea is under enlightenment thinking that the more ideas you have on the table and the better argued they are\nThe more likely it is that regular people will make good decisions about their lives that what you really need to have is an informed population that deals with fact and with evidence and with argument rabbits and was superstitions and traditions\nAnd this idea that the more ideas you have and the more\nCarefully that ideas and policies are argued the better the chances are that you're going to have a good government is really what drove the founders of this country to create a democracy the idea that everybody should have a say in their government and the idea that everybody should have the right to vote should have the right to have a say in who is\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...
