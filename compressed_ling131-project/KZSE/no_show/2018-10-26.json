deli now comes to the managing job\nIn the path that most major league teams are taking when they hire a new manager um they're looking for people with a background in being able to interpret the baseball data that's collected\n'em by their statistics by either analytics people and translating into performance on the field\nIn ball Delhi's a last job with Tampa Bay he was basically responsible

in baseball any a what does that mean and how do you use it\nBoy that's a that that that's a great question probably doesn't have a good thirty seconds to answer but it it's like so much of our culture now there were we we have access to so much more information about what's going on around us\nAnd the really short answer is taking information that may not have been available five years ago or ten years ago and putting it to a best use in a creating a successful product\nAnd frankly I think there's an a universal acknowledgement within the twins organization that they were slow to recognize all the was available to them and even slower to act on it\nAnd and to have a new manager and involved Delhi who was on the front lines of interpreting the data I think is a major step forward\nOkay so can you then say it's possible that the twins could be a lot better this\nUse more analytics oh I don't think there are any guarantees I think that one of the things that was

appreciate this opportunity\nOut here like we won't have a lot of rules this hour we're not running any stop watches or anything like that but the goal is to give you each a fair chance to state your positions on the issues\nAnd we won't take calls but I did ask the listeners in advance to send me some questions and I hope to get to as many of those as possible but let me start with a question in my own a Donald Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to win the eighth district in a long long time he's a strong backer of yours Pete Stauber\nSo tell us where do you most agree with the president and tell us if there are any areas where you disagree with the\nYou know I I agree with their President Trump's his uh his economic response or I I agree with his uh he's got really good business sense and he's propelling this with his at administrator and the tax cutting JOBS Act have really benefited the eighth congressional district\nAnd ah as I'm going around the district that's what I'm hearing the tax cutting JOBS Act have benefited so many manufacturing facilities\nAnd small businesses like the one my brothers and I own a some of the places that I disagree with uh I've talked about this earlier had I been in Congress just two years ago when our president's first budget went for like\nI Would have been the first one to stand up and talk about is zero funding for the great lakes are sort of initiative that was in that initial budget the great lakes are part of our economy and that would have fought fiercely to ensure that that are funding or is fully funded\nAnd so those are some things that that I Would uh really fight on behalf of the district voters\nThe other thing is busy the corporation I Know that President Trump wanted to get into the with the uh or at least talk about uh some type\nTech conglomerate and I support a Congress are men and women on both sides of the aisle that said there wasn't a good idea so I I Would have a I Would have supported the Congress on that issue\nAren't and didn't have to cut ... let me finish Pete\nDidn't have to cut half a shock classes the issue here is that the two hundred we increase taxes by two percent on income above two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for joining fathers so if you made two hundred fifty thousand dollars after our tax increase you paid an additional two hundred dollars in income taxes that's a fact I don't know most people in the eighth district are not making two hundred fifty thousand dollars is a household\nAnd they're going to be hurt by cuts of their schools that's why we past tax Joe tax increase in the tax payers outer ear out after one term\n[noise] All right let me let me just remind everybody you're listening to a debate or the ... the major party candidates for the eighth congressional district seat\nPete Stauber is the Republican ... which is the DFL are and as you can tell they disagree on a few things so let me bring up a question change the subject a little bit bring up a question from a listener is health care or write or a privilege and if ... ... let's start there are ...\nYou know health care is essential benefit well without a without a doubt it's an essential benefit a that is needed by every American in this country\nJordan image healthcare is a right and the richest and most productive country in the world and we can't afford to let people pay three hundred dollars of offer insulin rationing their insulin making decisions about whether they can pay their health care bill\nIn little falls there there are farmers paying forty thousand dollars on the individual market for health insurance or steel workers on the iron range or trying to bargain a fair contract where health care benefits of the sticking point\nThis is an issue that we have an ability of fixing this country every other country or every other industrialized nations gotten this right we pay more per person than any other country in the world\nProgramming

P. L. S. dot org for market times in locations how much is a cost\nAnd where does the money come from after we just talked about rowing deficit was so here's the deal is people are already paying health care expenses in this country right now we pay three point four trillion dollars annually right now at this point we pay Eighteen percent of the entire economy this country is wrapped up in health care spending\nBut no other nation has it like this right that's the problem is that Germany spends twelve percent of their GDP on the on healthcare let's annex ties nation we what we can do is instead of having people pay\nA premium to insurance companies where Thirteen to Eighteen percent of that is going into the overhead and we're seeing CEOs make sixty six million dollars a and not have one single person\nThen the issue really becomes that public programs operated much more efficient level and instead of paying sixty six million dollars and assurance executives think about how many doctors and nurses or other health care providers that could pay for\nOffs like Joe has zero credibility on health insurance when he was in the legislature uh he was a one of the decided votes or to bring us measure which we know was an unmitigated disaster\nPremiums skyrocketed five hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans were thrown off their health care including those with preexisting conditions and so he wants the keys to the nation's health care we know that uh the his a Medicare for all scheme will not work it'll be a budget buster\nFor those people who hold on make like those people who\nAre on employer paid insurance you're going to get thrown off\nFor our seniors that have foiled their entire life\nA from a waiting to get on Medicare or a a a benefit that they were promised and they earned and the veterans like my wife will be thrown off their health care altogether and Joel ah when he tried to explain it\nThey pay for it it was raising taxes in in the Washington Post gave them three Pinocchios for that\nThere's a way to measure the washer celebrating on just one second please stop or what would you do then to make health care more affordable and more available\nYou know first of all let's let's face it there's not a red or blue played a book there's not a Republican or Democrat\nThat has the monopoly on the good ideas Mike what I Want to do is start with things we can agree on and I think Joe a agrees that a pre existing conditions should be covered we need to look at associated health plans\nFor small businesses like myself Mike that can pool or resources together and have the opportunity to a ... have our employees have affordable health insurance we needed affordable assess the ball and the quality and just last week or make I spoke to physicians and hospitals administrators\nAnd they said Joe's plan would be devastating\nNot only for like a ... hour your criticism of his plan to do but I'm trying to figure out what you would do ...\nI just talked about let's start from where we things we can agree on and work out we know that we needed affordable assess the boat enough quality of quality but we don't need to take a sledgehammer to our health care system does the same\nJob and his allies were the same group that said that uh if you want your doctor you can keep him if you like your plan you can keep it we know there are some good things in the Affordable CARE Act and I think we start from there so you wouldn't repeal I\nKnow because there's we don't have anything in place that you would editor at the Republican health care less what so what we need to do my is as we as we go forward really have a bipartisan effort and not care which political party gets the credit okay and do what's right for the Americans\nHave your it and yeah so there's a number of things in there that are worth addressing the first is that not everybody agrees that associated health care plans are a good way to go in fact many experts think that that's exactly the problem is that what what will end up\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from the E. H. Argo healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learn more at E. H. R. go dot com\nIsn't it so that we are useful plant it increased price but it also brought people with preexisting conditions into the pool and it allowed them to pay a rate that wasn't higher than everybody else which is the issue that people with preexisting conditions have here's the deal is that the Republicans tried to pass a health care plan this last year that Pete refuses to take a position on\nThat would endanger two hundred Seventy five thousand people with preexisting conditions just in our district alone it would make coverage unattainable unaffordable I Want to say one more thing too about this which is that\nUm when we talk about universal healthcare which candidate has what's the European nations have which even Mexico has when we talk about universal health care like that what that means is that everybody will have coverage everybody will have basic coverage so it's disingenuous to say that would be kicking people out there plants\nYes we'll be eliminating some of those plans that will ever have current people ... will have coverage\nYeah pizza and he just admitted it it's going to eliminate plans and that's what I just said it's going to kick people off their health insurance out of ... their employees paid for it\nHave to remember when when Joe comes up and start talking about this he has zero credibility he brought us the the worst a healthcare disaster in the state of Minnesota that we're still digging out of and but you wouldn't repeal that and\nAnd ... and Mike in St voted to give ... executives taxpayer funded bonuses when the system was when men sure was burning up and the Web sites were broken I had I just talked about the things we can agree on my start with a kid it really stinks teach you\nExperts don't agree on those things you don't agree on preexisting condone I Do but he also getting as might might might already had our plans to let you aren't heartland voted to endanger people's houses and condition a Republican governor measuring so they don't happen\nAnd there's ... people off Joe you kick several hundred thousand people off their insurance what are you voted for ... including preexisting conditions you know my wife and I have a six year old son with Down syndrome and I've this is our fourth debate and I've told you this\nI Will require insurance companies to cover pre existing conditions my son is born with two of them\nI have a nephew at age to who was diagnosed with type one diabetes through no fault of his own why should she suffered the rest of his life for social continues or global ... myth hang on Joe continues to propel the myth\nThat Pete Stauber ah doesn't support ... pre existing conditions and I do have\nTold me that although I Do see Asian people of advocates for or those with Down syndrome came out against the Republican health care plan because it would endanger people with preexisting conditions making their health care unaffordable on attainable what we can do is we can sit here and talk but the reality and the facts on the ground are that the president's own administration\nIs expanding waivers so that these insurance companies don't have to cover people with preexisting conditions wrong words are no that's not wrong it's a fact you go wrong with ... you can literally look this up around these are okay but that's\nNot what I needed one I Know these are talking on let's just have some let's let's just be a little more civil\nGo ahead you're finished yeah so these what we have our wars and we have actions and words are not matching the actions when it comes to Republicans on health care the president's administration just last week as an expanding access to waivers to the people are that insurance companies in in many states won't have to cover people with ... ... pre existing conditions the um\nThe Republicans tried to pass a health care bill that would endanger two hundred twenty five thousand just in the eighth congressional district ... pre existing conditions there are words and then there are records and the words are not matching the records in this particular case repeating the Republican Pete Stark\nA Joe's got a reckless record in the

you both have probably heard this one before where do you stand on copper nickel mining on public lands or an environment environmentally sensitive areas\nThan he paid his criminal fines and that that the debate in Duluth or the Duluth news Tribune editor Chuck Frederick uh when they were interviewing him said is there anything else and he said no\nLater we found out there was this drug ... no no that was no no no and and so that's why they brought it up at the debate I'm Joe talked to talked about character we'd have to look at\nAt a character a plays a big part in this you know you'd have to

R. go dot com\nMonths ago um but the fact matter as I've been open and honest about all those things I made mistakes in my life I've learned and I've grown and that's part of a being a real human being but again this is coming back to this email thing it seems bizarre to me that he just won't release the Fifteen emails if there's nothing to hide in them why won't he released them\nJoe has to be a transparent here um the fact of the matter is a ... which would still be living in the metro\nHad Rick Nolan not vacated seat a and that's a fact\nUh in on December thirty first Joe has had written a in a information to a a a house candidate\nDonating to his campaign and he gave an address in an apartment in Minneapolis he has told the public that he'd never lived in Minneapolis he commuted\nUh this is the this is the the history with Joe and not being a a transparent and people see it throughout the district and and I my goal\nIs to uh I Want to these last couple of weeks I Want to really get out and meet a lot of people to really show them because the character\nAh in in my life is is a comes about from my experience is both good and bad the hardships the successes you know being a father make is one of the proudest things for me and they can ... I can share with you that those of us who are parents for example\nNever sleep good until all their kids are in bed and that's what happened to me last night and so this this is resonating with the people ... character is how you behave when no one else was looking okay look and the only time success comes before sweat isn't the dictionary let's\nHave a majority of its give her response than I have another question yeah yeah so again if character matters in Wyoming\nThese lawsuits are I think that's in the public interest and the other thing is that you know ... ... my dad was a construction electrician and if he was lucky he was working two hours away from home many times he was working in North Dakota or in a Montana and apartments in those places\nI've never voted anywhere in the crowds marriage Minnesota I Lived in ... in my entire life I have worked in the twin cities I'm very proud of the work that I've done here and on behalf of my my good friend and somebody I think same an excellent magic fry a but these are ridiculous merely nuclear the declaration that handle well\nLet me just ask a question on sort of on this broad a character issue that came from a listener when you're facing a tough decision what personal experience do you use to help you decide what the next step should be and a stubborn start with you\nSo as a police officer small business owner husband and father are you there is tough choices almost on a daily basis you go back to your experience and you do what's right or experience matters life experience matters and as a police officer for example in the city do if we had to make instantaneous decisions\nAnd those good decisions you make in those those are urgent moments you have to rely on your experience to make them and uh when you have a experience as a police officer some of those really immediate really life a life\nAltering decisions have to be made instantaneously so I go back to my life I go back to the experiences that I have ah been blessed with in my life to make those decisions Mike\nJordan which I put myself in someone else's shoes and that's easy enough for me to do because I have dealt with a great deal the verse in my life when I was\nSixteen years old I'm my my life was pretty good at that point my came home from track practice on march Eighteenth I bet a family member or shoot himself try to take his own life and eleven months after that my mother was murdered by a separate family member who took his own life then as well and I've\nYeah that was a period of time when I got that ticket and you know I made it through um but I recognize that not everybody had the resources that I did when I needed that I had teachers around me who are supporting me a who lifted me up who taught me that the ... Valley Public education is about more than textbooks in classrooms\nI had a good health insurance because my dad had a good union electrician job and I think that everybody deserves access to those things in life and for me I'm putting myself in someone else's shoes and holding myself accountable to the values that I've always grown up with that I've learned through good times and bad is how I make decisions\nLet me ask another question from a listener ah this listener said since the un panel released its a climate change report a couple of weeks ago that called for really some big changes in in a hurry to make a difference what if anything would you support to address climate change and Pete Stauber start with you\nYeah I read that report to Mike and and uh it's an issue that we have to look at it I Know that a drill neither ... nor hires a scientist\nOr we have to look at what are the causes and how can we reduce the emissions and I think that it's a it's a great healthy discussion because at the scientific level\nUh there's there's some discussions on what we can put forth that uh you can uh can slow the process and uh I'm open to to discussions and in in a and learn from the scientist because like I said another job or scientists\nJordan image climate change is real ah there is no discussion anymore and there hasn't been frankly discussion for a long time\nOr the overwhelming majority of scientists believe one thing about this and that it's happening and that it's caused by\nGreenhouse gases like a CEO to and like methane and ah that it's largely a caused by human activity right and so we have to be able to number one or mitigate the damage is that are already being done I think that that looks like reducing a green house\nMaking sure that we uh you know continue to advance a sensible and sustainable\nUm policies that will reduce those gases we also need to invest I think in a renewable forms of energy to continue to diversify the energy basket\nAnd beyond that were also frankly at this point because people have been dragging their feet on this issue for so long going to have to look at adaptation techniques I think that that's the real a dilemma here and and everybody every expert agrees on is there is no conversation to have any more\n[noise] ... why I I I'll read it reiterate would have just said I said we have to look at things to to to make sure that we leave or not only this country but this world in better shape and we got it and so uh I'm I'm always willing to take a look at things and and I'm a perpetual learner\nA another question from a listener are any new gun laws needed after recent mass shootings for example do you support background checks on all gun sales and I think this person is looking for a yes or no answer Jordan which start with you yes you support background checks to just ...\nHad background checks as Mike as a police officer for twenty three years [noise] ah I can say this well off duty in Nineteen Ninety five I was shot in the head in downtown Duluth who years later while on duty a perpetrator and a hostage situation cut the jump on me\nHold a hand gun within five feet pulled the trigger by the grace of God it malfunctioned and I was literally fighting for my life I still support our Second Amendment to have a lot of individual law abiding citizens the right to keep and bear arms there is not a person that I Know that once a career criminal\nA drug addict somebody who's going through crisis or others that should possess or have a firearm we need to keep those firearms out of those criminals hands and one of the things that I'm very proud of in St Louis county we have a we have a um a lead prosecutor\nWill not a plead down any gun crime and I'm very proud of that because he understands that we understand the importance of reducing violence in our in our communities and so in St Louis county there's no please don't gun crimes Mike\nJordan if there are large loopholes in our background check system and I think that that's the spirit of the question that was asked and that wasn't the ants that we got from Pete Stauber dinner a spending two hundred thousand dollars to beat me right now and I think it's in part because I'm most gun owners recognize that we can have sensible\nAh reforms that protect people I mean we've seen now a mass shootings in Las Vegas or about a year ago there were four hundred and fifty people shot within five minutes because somebody was able to go by multiple assault style weapons the outfit than what bump stocks and high capacity magazines\nAnd direct carnage on the streets of Las Vegas and I think that in a civilized society we can have both a protection to the second amendment I'm an avid hunter that have been my whole life have plenty against myself and also sensible gun reform\nClearing and breezy on Sunday with a high in the mid fifties\nNPR News is a part of your community orders across the region covering the story
