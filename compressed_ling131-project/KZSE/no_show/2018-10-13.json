F. D. Ninety nine\nIt close for check writing centers of by agency eliminated five percent\nOf our agency's workforce save two billion dollars improve the service the American people that's what I did with the job I moved bill through the Congress I've worked in the Congress I have the experience to know where the bodies are buried and go out there on earth and reform government downsized government\nDan Feehan any response yeah the Washington is full of ... that's why it is broken right now people who are beholden to their party leaders people are beholden to corporate pacts and special interests\nWhich is why I have not taken a dime from corporate pacts because I Know that what prevents both parties for moving anything for my hope we get a chance to talk about health care and things like that is the ability of people to have an unwillingness as they do right now that's that's why it has broken and that's what people hate that's why people are cynical about politics\nTo a bone any number of issues if you guys want to uh ... let me I just stay on the area of agriculture for one second though because I did get a question from a listener\nWho said what would you do or what could the federal government do to address continued poor wallet water quality in almost all southern Minnesota lakes and streams dance and do you want to start with that one\nIs absolutely we have we have to take advantage that farmers are stewards of their own land first and foremost in the idea that I think he may have to make policy through carrots and sticks\nAnd it's incumbent on the rest of the community that's not an farming to do their part to clean up water too but you have to have investment too and that's where the idea of infrastructure comes in 'cause emphasis ruptures not just roads and bridges but an investment in water and no one knows that more than the southwest corner of the state in the community of Worthington that desperately needs not it's not just a matter of quality of water but having water in the first place\nThere's a role here for the farmers to play that because they have been a part of doing incredible work to clean up water along the way they shouldn't just be based on carrots alone and that's something I Want to make sure in stand up because the idea of\nRegulations as becomes part is a measure my opponent we'll talk about here has to be one in which farmers are part of the conversation leading the conversation because they at the end of day have as much interest if not more in the quality of land the soil and water to either Jim Agha darn and clean water\nWhile I was just talking with Kevin pap the head of the Minnesota Farm Bureau about these very issues two days ago you know Farm Bureau endorsed me because they they want somebody that's going to be pro egg and this has to be a balance you know what's been going on over the last many years against farmers has been an overreach during the Obama administration we had a war against agriculture\nAnd part of that was led by the APA under Obama that put out this waters of the United states which was a complete overreach we had people in Minnesota weather buffer strips and everything else\nAnd it's just it's gone too far you know they don't give the farmers credit for for being good stewards of the land farmers don't want to want to waste their fertilizer\nProgramming is supported by near or a new kind of precision pain clinic pinpoints pain at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing nearer clinics\nDot com\nWhich means the house and the Senate have to uh for major regulations before the impact farmers and others does Dan support that I don't know you never will address it and then I say we're not the waters and we should sunset well I mean again it's a balance\nIt's a balance it I I don't take the premise that every lake in stream and southern Minnesota is polluted to a point of no return I think many of them are clean\nIt depends on the standards that you could probably demonstrate though through science I imagine right it's it depends on the standards you can change standards all the time and say well they need to be there's a magic Senate you said it's impossible to determine whether or not their class so as possible and say it was I I think I think we're doing just fine\n[noise] All right let me just remind everybody we're listening to a debate or between the two candidates for Congress in Minnesota's first district\nThe Democrat is Dan fee in the Republican is Jim Hackett darn ah the question of healthcare came up and I got a question from a listener what will you do to resolve the health care cost crisis in other words what would you do in Congress to make health insurance more affordable and available Jim ...\nThe first thing we have to do is repeal Obamacare and replace it with free market reforms at a minimum send it back to send that authority back to the states you know the state of Minnesota did not need Obamacare\nThis was the one state of all and the union that didn't need Obamacare in Ninety four percent of the people covered with a system in place for people with preexisting expensive medical needs and now of course the the people that said keep your doctor keep your plan saved twenty five hundred dollars\nYou know Obama administration people like Dan how they say let's go to socialize medicine to have universal health care like they have all around the world\nProgramming is supported by farmers markets of Minneapolis twenty nine markets open outdoors through October an indoor markets open throughout the winter you can visit farmers' markets of M. P. L. S. dot org for market times in locations\nMedical care prescription drugs pre tax\nNobody pays federal tax on that money anymore that's where ... what he should have an individual tax reform moving forward then have accounts out there that so they can invest that money saved but they have incentives for healthy living because we don't spend it you get to keep your own money [noise]\nUh have transparency and cost very important across the board so people can shop major medical catastrophic coverage with a with a doctor bill that would be reasonable that can be done by the insurance companies or private sector\nAnd after that a a pool for people high risk pool for people with preexisting expensive medical needs paid for by the insurance companies backed up by the government everybody gets quality timely care everybody is a good spot nobody goes broke over it that's how insurance should operate\nCan I just ask you a question though because uh Obamacare said ah kids could stay on their parents' insurance till they were to six and it also said that the insurance companies couldn't discriminate against people with preexisting medical conditions\nThat we weren't doing that in Minnesota if you want to add twenty six that's fine\nBut the state's can handle it I trust that the state of Minnesota where the good governor and legislature you're going to get it right much more so than H H s bureaucrats\nDeciding the standards of care for our doctors taking away our our doctor patient relationships look you know Obamacare was an absolute disaster for southern Minnesotans we have people paying twenty and thirty thousand dollars a year for premiums would adoptable so high the underline insurance is virtually worthless\nOkay let's let Dan fee and talk about this how do you uh\nAn important point of approach to my my opponent likes to bring up a conversations from two thousand ten because he's been running for Congress since two thousand ten and that's an important point I'm I'm living in twenty eight team right now in the reality of a health\nSupport for NPR's ... intellectual property grip with offices in Minnesota in Los Angeles Inskeep ... group aims to help companies leverage their power as patents to protect their innovation you didn't find out more Inskeep law dot com\nMarkets here but the idea that someone on on their private insurance right now let's talk about the individual market and talked to a farmer at farm fest who's two kids had the flu went to get them treated and paid seven hundred fifty dollars out of pocket for that\nHer reaction to that was that she simply wouldn't go to the doctor next time because it wasn't worth it so what are you going to get a gun tree in a country where flu deaths are on the rise\nSo what I Would propose to do inserts simply as the idea of a public option that people can buy into the public option into Medicare so that people are paying for it and it becomes an alternative because everything that my opponent just described here of the private system right now it is a for profit system in which people are tempted to make money off of people's house\nThere has to be something that has to be another option there that had has makes an incentive for companies to drive the prices downwards and not continue to make a buck off of people and the only way that Congress is going to be able to to\nDo all the way forward on this is to not have people under the influence of big pharma and insurance companies something which my opponent is under the influence of himself and something I'm not\nA Jim Hackett on what's wrong with letting people buy into Medicare\nUh well it will destroy the system for Medicare for one thing and it's ... well it's going to cause the systems about bankrupt now\nSo you're going to add to it but here or hang onto it hanging out here as well okay take it to whoever you want but that's my my contention the either the concept of Medicare for all socialized medicine universal healthcare a single payer or whatever you want to call it\nIs going to destroy medicine or do they know they're all different kinds of oil isn't going to destroy medicine as you know it it's going to make sure that we have inferior medical quality medical innovation will suffer more if you want if you want people more people on Medicare guess what the Mayo Clinic and all the find Institute\nOn the dollar rather than a dollar on the dollar they can't sustain the model if you do this is going to destroy the progress and growth in Rochester, Minnesota and a lot much of southern Minnesota all those buildings going up all the people that flow and to Rochester that comes to an end\nAnd so this is a big choice for the people as you want it to the vision and we want to put people in charge that are going to take us to socialized medicine or do you want people in charge to get keep us with a private so as far as incentives are concerned and this is America there was a way we do business we had people instead of\nCompanies go out there and produce good medical devices and so forth and and drugs and everything else doctors go to school for many years and they want something to return there's nothing wrong with that\nOkay Dan Feehan response absolutely bringing in it and the Mayo Clinic is absolute right idea here and they have to be at the table with but this is an institution founded founded and has been a leader in the world on healthcare so why not to have them at the table and we're talking about large scale health reform\nI Do agree with that report and what would you do about it Dan fan\nYes I agree with that report and they shouldn't be a function of of that first question is what do you do about is an excellent we've had a couple of debates and last week uh we had one a couple of nights ago and which my opponent\nOr declared that he wasn't sure about climate change that it was just the earth warming and cooling as usual well I I have a different perspective on this I have the perspective of people like secretary Jim Mattis and the perspective of the ... the chairman of the joint chiefs General Dunford who believe that long term\nThe biggest threat facing our country in terms of security is climate change and in in this question of what you do about it has to be the next immediate question and the next immediate question has to be answered with a perspective of southern Minnesota to where we've had an incredible amount of rain recently and more and more continuously that is changing the way we're farming that it's changed\nSupport from Minnesota Public radio comes from the E. H. R. go healthcare education software with diverse unrealistic patient care simulations to teach human centered use of technology and healthcare learned more ed E. H. R. go dot com\nTo make sure the first district of Minnesota is energy independence that we aren't relying on fossil fuels and we're making continual effort to not do so and it's making sure that people like in the U.S navy or tried to become energy independent and that you were championing those technologies because they will be to the benefit of all of us along the way\nBut if you're opening premise again is the idea that I don't believe in it well then we have another thing coming because I I'd I'd like you to to give as a response to the chairman the joint chiefs of staff or ...\nYou know whether you believe in it or not really doesn't matter what you would do about it if you think it's a problem and it's manmade well then what are you going to do about it there are a lot of people out there including on the left who would say spend money to relocate make changes but to transform our energy sector\nAnd the turn our economy upside down over the premise that at some point the world comes to an end no I don't agree with that because it would be highly destabilizing for our economy and it would drive up the cost\nFor everybody in our country and make us less affluent why support is this I support a policy of energy independence for the United states\nAnd that means in all of the above approach now Dan doesn't understand the issue I don't believe because the United states is ... is energy independent for every source except crude oil so the only way we're going to become energy independence is to drill for more crude oil in the United states which I support\nAnd I think the ... the Trump Administration has done a good job in this area we also need to make sure that we have the infrastructure in place to utilize and inefficient way our energy resources and we have more energy resources than any other country in the world\nPipelines distribution points refineries those are things that the Democratic party aren't too fond of anymore and that's why a lot of laborers are leaving their party and we want to build\nAnd they didn't like Keystone you know that President Obama blocked that and then after that just make sure we have a policy in place that we have\nReliable affordable energy because when the price of energy goes up the price of every product in service in our economy goes up money out of your back pocket makes us less competitive all these things that Dan and Obama and others wanted to do are going to take power from the United states and senator around the world to our adversaries are trading adversaries\nCould be Brazil China India and others\nPoint is is he says he wants to do something about it do you support a carbon tax do you support the Paris climate accord do you support cap and trade\nDo what do you what do you support the support and ... and Jason portrayal regulations\nOn fracking just to be clear you don't support any of those ... those answers to do nothing or do what if if the chances of dying for here right now as I told you about the risks posed this is a very real things let's basis and national security there are military US military installations around the world at risk because of climate change\nTheir very place right now if if we if you came forward and said we need to do something about climate change with these what was your reaction\nBe loved if General Mattis said that and he said he probably would say we have to adapt we have to react we have to do whatever we can but I didn't I didn't hear General Mattis come out and save for the Paris climate accord sees for for a ban on fracking now he's our that is far too hard but his tag\nRoles that is to ensure that we are we're supporting and defending our service members and so again if military installations around the around the world these are these are American troops\nAre at risk because of climate legs don't hide them into their belief how do you get there dancing and do you put a tax on carbon what do you do look we have to make sure that we're doing first and foremost inability to make energy be make ourselves as a country energy independent\nAnd that means going away from fossil fuel\nAnd as long as we are engaging in in anything with with fossil fuels we have to do it in the safest possible way\nBut if we aren't doing everything to make up for the inaction of ...\nAnd the fall further and further behind the best thing I can do as a member of Congress is to make sure that it climate reform bill makes its way forward entertaining any idea possible to reduce our carbon footprint and that's why I'm open to it but it has you have to be open to actually changing things and\nTaking advantage of the opportunity we have right now economically in southern Minnesota to take and champion ... a renewable energy like solar and wind or biofuels anyway one more\nYou know you walk through a parade last year and Albert lea with a sign that said to act on climate change will put it up on our Facebook page later\nAnd you come on the show and we had three debates and he was still won't tell us what you want to do to act on climate change you do support a carbon tax you do support the Paris climate accord\nYou do support say up and read it twice already and then there was a matter of listening it happened when you do support the regulations that Obama had on fracking and methane and all these things to stop us from getting our own resources\nAnd that's why the farm bureau and the farmers and other support me 'cause they know and what do you get what's the farmers supposed to do to act on climate is supposed to stop farm in the day or start to stop farming tomorrow for our Senate tops\nMore resilient and actually deal with the impact right now something that I remember I had a tough time answering at a far fetched if I remember right how do we actually make sure that in the event of a southern Minnesota that's dealing with more rain than ever before that's dealing with an iron fist of temperatures how do we make sure our crops or more recently along the way again this is a matter of action Jim not inaction down a difference between\nUs again I think I think your positions now are clear and they don't represent reflect the views and values of southern Minnesota I Do believe minute will let the voters decide\nOkay let me ask you this question or do we need a wall on the Mexican border\nCourse of course we need a wall we need a wall and eat fencing we need every kind of security border we can so that ill illegal folks drugs everybody else don't come over and don't come into the United states wants to come here through legal process absolutely Dan's against the wall we've we've got 'em on you know he is\nProgramming is supported by near or a new kind

should be in a position to know who's coming are they going to assimilate it pretty good chance that they can contribute to our economy\nYou know are they going to become part of the fabric of America because if they're not we truly it's not good for us to have them here okay Dan Feehan\nThat the premise of the question is is law to me\nDo we need to keep our country safe yes absolutely and we need to make sure we're doing everything possible to do so and there was no one better to represent southern Minnesota and then interest and someone who spent two tours in Iraq\nServing this country keeping this country safe and who spent three and a half years in the Pentagon trying to keep this country safe and I'm insulted by the idea that my opponent thinks that I wouldn't be able to to be a part of this conversation\nBecause that's not what my service taught me directly in the first place and if we're thinking about how to keep this country safe it doesn't start with the one way you do it it starts with a broader conversation about them very much the real threats facing our country which increasingly\nDon't have anything to do with the border but increasingly do what cybersecurity bioterrorism and the many different ways that you can enter this country if our entire focus is spent on the idea of the wall we are going to miss things that are bigger threat to this country along the way\nIf you want to have that conversation great do you have a conversation about immigration reform I'd be happy to do that because that's what I hear consistently in the district people in need of workers people who want an economic case for immigration reform a moral case a national security\nYou did take advantage of the human capital we have to keep our economy strong NATO I'm someone who was on it and they believer in a guest worker program a vigorous one I'm someone who believes in making DACA law and I'm someone who believes in the hardworking people that are paying taxes in our district to have a pathway to citizenship so we can stay strong\nBut these conversations both have to be happened to be have to do it is not one for the other ...
