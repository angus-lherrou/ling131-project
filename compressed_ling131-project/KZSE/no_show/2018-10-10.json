really not societies bottom line\nThey are not oriented towards doing the common good they need paying customers they take a short term view they have to their priority as their shareholders not what's good for society if you're a low income medicated customer and you have a lot of different complex knees\nOr you're in the Amazon driver in between gigs retailers don't really see you as a money making opportunity if we turn to employers they insure less than half of our population the\nScale of the employers who can actually drive change is very small and when you look at the alliances like Amazon Berkshire Hathaway\nTaping Morgan they only cover a tiny fraction a million in fact this government that has that scale government is playing an increasingly large role in the role of hair both for Medicare and Medicaid and if we look at that silver tsunami that's coming out of that is only going to grow\nRetail alliances are not enough Washington actually has to be part of the solution when you look at the health care industry is unique it's actually full of market failures life monopolies short term incentives all kinds of things that the private sector won't solve on its own we need Washington at the table\nWe have to have retail employers they're necessary but they're not sufficient\nOther developed nations have actually made that successful\nThey provide overwhelming proof that this can happen we don't need scattershot solutions we need a better functioning system\n[noise] but I Want to do for us to wear a resolution\nIs retail answers not Washington will save\nRound to end and round to the debaters address one another directly they also take questions for me\nAnd from you our audience here at the Mayo transform conference or the resolution again returned alliances not Washington will save the U.S health care system\nWe have to debaters arguing in support of this motion red Jay ... and Greg Slager arguing that Washington is broken that the u._s. and too many categories is last last last that the government does not know how to surf consumers\nThat the retailers know how to scale that they have multiple ways\nTo reach not just their employees but also their customers they asked rhetorically the question who really has\nThe incentive to fix the problem\nAnd to reward the best service and do so with transparency and their answer to that is the American employer with an emphasis on the retail sector\nThe team arguing against the motion at least ... and Rosemary day there say they are not arguing that Washington is the sole solution but they are definitely saying they're going to a clinic such as Wal Mart's may be convenient but it's just not the same thing as going to the doctor they questioned the motives of these retailers\nThey say that they cannot scale the kind of health care that needs to be delivered system why does not just primary care but really the big big problems and they don't see these companies getting interested in that\nA lot of area of disagreement and I want to work through some of it but I Want to start to you Greg Slater you're both of your opponents argued that retail companies\nUltimate loyalty is to shareholders not to the health of their employees or the health of their customers is just the fact of life\nGives to lie to the whole notion that we should be trusting them to take on this job what's your response to that\nFirst off I think that if you're lowering your healthcare costs for employers so you can buy more goods she called the junk there is a big portion of America that doesn't think it's junk and its survival for them I think that that's important because what you've done as you gave them choice you reduce huh\nYou gave them choice CBS took cigarettes out of their store two billion dollars in sales\nGone overnight because they want to be viewed as a health provider they are building trust they're becoming more mission based not sick care this is healthcare this is helping them live healthier lives to this is helping them with nutrition this was keeping them ... those are the big problems I mean you look at\nAnd that's what these employer alliances are all about getting employers to work directly with providers systems and finally exert their control and that will drive down costs\nI mean when you talk about employers exerting control I Am all for\nBut when you get right down to at large employers are only a third of all employed Americans\nMy family owns a John Deere dealership outside of Houston, Texas my mother who manages the benefits doesn't have the time bandwidth or knowledge to not go through an intermediary to help them find good health care for their couple of dozen employees completely different game for the folks who worked for small business and I was\nGoing to add that insurers has been that intermediary and they have often been accused of having a lot of power maybe sometimes too much in certain markets\nAnd yet they struggle when they go up against some of the large provider systems that have been increasingly consolidating and assembling their market power and almost in a sense being able to set prices okay if I Want to get an employer alliance it feels a little like David and Goliath to me\nI Want to look the other side respond and then I Want to come to your question which he would like to respond to Greg I Would I Would to\nThat issue and those are good points that you're making here too but when you're thinking about saving just thinking about the future and not the past and when I was thinking about you know innovation to companies and\nAn aggregation platforms and the whole purpose of these that you've seen them disrupted other industries they've disrupt travel they've been ... media they disrupted retail sixty percent of purchases are made through a demand aggregation platform on line from a retail perspective\nAnd we're building those things to try to drive similar disruption aggregating employees\nDemand will encourage provider supplier platform involvement too and it's a virtuous cycle we've seen it happen many many times this is where technology can help\nIt's a virtuous cycle the more employers that come on board than these alliances in these small village and your family's business I could get on a platform that could have care and supplies and what not delivered more price competitively and more transparency can really change I I I\nHave to jump in so we can move on to audience questions sir and if you could tell us your name too my name is ... I live here in Rochester I function as an emergency doc my question is what you think the government and retailers could do for the homeless and others who currently are being underserved what about the homeless people\nWould I Would like to go first to jail or\nYes\nWe totally agree that government has a role in here too and I think one place where we fail in this country that other countries do a much better job of is in our social network and creating those safety nets the government and retail should work together and figure something out like that but I really do think that social care is really something that we really need to invest in\nI work as a physician night you still working homeless clinics in San Francisco a city that is played by ... homeless problem Medicare and Medicaid are great negotiators but you know if I'm running a homeless clinic which I've done in the past\nWhen do I prefer to pay Medicare and Medicaid prices for a band aid and Tylenol or what I prefer to pay Amazon prices the change in the distribution that we can have is going to be meaningful and it's going to allow us to provide better care for the poor\nSupport for NPR's brought you by the law firm of ... intellectual property group with offices in Minnesota in Los Angeles Inskeep ... group aims to help companies leverage the power of patents to protect their innovation you didn't find out more at ... dot com boom all Americans\nFrom the other side response to that question so I Rosemarie that\nThey're still gonna be the forgotten people until they actually have some money to put on the table government needs to play that role to not forget about the chicken really folks who are homeless and our country does very poorly relative to others in terms of our investment in social services so that's something that we have to have the collective well to do\nRetailers can partner in that I think they're innovative programs\nLike the idea of a trickle down health care benefits to the homeless employers and retailers are going to lower costs and will make its way nobody made that argument\nWhat I Would like to get every phone was person access to you as a federally qualified health center which prides fantastic primary care and mental health benefits to a lot of American\n\nHave you ever does her name she's thank you my name is Spencer merchant from Minneapolis, Minnesota I work for the insurance side how are the retail agency is going to transform clinical care who stroke and mostly about price points and negotiation and\nDoes this future really look like nuts and bolts since you're a ...\nIt's going to evolve they're more money is going into consulting rooms and expanding the care facilities and these large retailers some of these entities I mean there are food deserts and there are a pharmacy does too but some of these retailers they're effectively the community centers they know all the people in the neighborhood they come in\nWalmart has a hundred and fifty million visitors to their stores every year you know the engagement that they have with the folks in their community and I think it's going to help them\nIn terms of preventive care\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from the ...

Barton I'm from the University of Wisconsin Madison and we've spoken a little bit about how you need money to access the system as it exists today but what about the incentive that retail has to actually\nCreate a future where you then have money to participate in retail in a way that I went to\nFoot or you're seeing that dynamic as an argument to support the foresight or as a challenge to force for both sides okay let's take the reason I asked the question is I thought I actually heard that's the only reason that Wal Mart as interested in bringing down health care costs so that you would have more money to spend on\nOther products and Wal Mart you you didn't actually argue whether that's a good thing or a bad thing but the phenomena but I Want to take it to the other side first the dynamics\nI think having a motive or or just an effective putting more spending money in people's pockets because their health care costs have gone to ...\nAs I mentioned I think that's a good thing because what you've done as you move\nSomething that was not by choice to something that is by choice something that's a burden to something that's an opportunity to think about those families and what they need to know their life do they need to pay more for health care or more for other than the food and the central to help the social determinants of health the other impacts on health outside of just visiting the health system\nSo why is that a bad thing if they drive down the cost and you can buy more stuff at Wal Mart was ... so\nThere's two points first being okay they might free up a little bit of your disposable income by changing how are you by a drunk or get a\nFlu shot or a sore throat visit that's a fantastic thing but if they're really going to transform the system you're going to have to trust a retailer to partner with you on something like cancer care\nAre you ready for that are you going do like Wal Mart telling you where you have to go to get your chemotherapy\nI Would also to not go directly to retail is the only solution that can free up more of our disposable income from health care um it may not be mine necessary political stance that a lot of people are arguing that Medicare for all would do that for the average American so I think there are myriad ways we could get there\nOkay I Would love to continue with the question answers section but we're out of time that concludes round to this intelligence squared us debates where\nOur resolution is retail alliances\nWith the U.S health care system and now we move\nOn to round three where each of the debaters makes a closing statement first Greg Slater senior partner in global health transaction leader at Ernst and young\nA follow on to that question actually so I mean I just want you to imagine everybody knows in Iran Iran is fifty six years old she lives with her husband she's on ...\nAnd she's struggling with high blood pressure she goes to a retailer once or twice a week with her husband to buy products that she typically buys that the retailer knows who it's intimate relationship and engagement and through using data analytics\nWhile she's in she goes to the pharmacy she reveals a script she buys some insulin strips\nShe stops to get her blood pressure tested to compare it to her home result she's got one at home and it's been spiking a bit so she goes into Walmart for free she gets her her blood pressure taken it's hot so she stopped by the Clinton to get some questions answered and what they do is they put her on a tell all health monitored with a doctor who\nWho asked her about what's going on any other kind of things in her life that might be causing these things and then gives her new prescriptions so she goes and she pays for a generic four dollars\nCloudy on Thursday with ties in the upper thirties partly cloudy on Thursday night with low temperatures in the upper twenties\nHey there I'm Joshua Johnson to host of one egg every weekday morning on NPR News we talk about the most important issues of our time bringing context in inside to stories across the country and the ...\nJoined me for one a weekday mornings at ten on NPR News\nIt's still a mystery how prominent Saudi journalist went missing that turned U.S officials may be getting closer I'm Rachel Martin and I'm David Greene the danger mall 'cause she'll be disappeared Fifteen Saudi men where did we ride with you stumbled Saudi officials deny he was killed so they provided no evidence left because with a live\nAlso with sexual assault prominent in the news will hear out one group is teaching teenagers about consent\nAnd remembering George Calif eroded first black layer drafted by the NFL this Wednesday October tenth to divert the former NFL quarterback\nFarr turned thirty nine today here's the news\nLine from NPR News in Washington on corporate Coleman the national Hurricane Center is warning that hurricane Michael is now an extremely dangerous category for storm tops ...

such an increase and wants to use general fund money and bonding to pay for road projects Johnson also opposes the push that many Democrats favor toward a single payer health care system\nSingle payer means there isn't private insurance anymore we all lose their insurance and we're all forced on the one government plan I think we need to move in exactly the opposite direction because one of the reasons we're in such a terrible spot right now is because government took over a lot of what we were doing really well in Minnesota\nJohnson press walls repeatedly about single payer during the lengthy exchange on health care wall shot back that Johnson was looking for a bogeyman you also suggested Johnson had a fundamental misunderstanding of the issue\nLet's get to the heart of this cost

benefits outweigh the costs that's very possible but we don't know what the costs are\nJohnson also said he would cooperate with federal enforcement of immigration laws he said walls would create a

bracing for more acts of climate change civil disobedience following a high profile case in northern Minnesota is Clearwater county\nA judge has acquitted three climate activists on charges of damaging an oil pipeline which some say could embolden more protesters to fight climate change by attempting to shut off fossil fuel supplies\nElizabeth Dunbar who's been following the case and she joins us in Studio ... morning first up what did these activists due to end up in court\nTwo years ago these activists from Seattle trust passed on to Enbridge energy property in Clearwater county they called up the company said\nWe're about to shut off the flow of oil and that's pipeline and they even videotape themselves using bolt cutters to cut the lock on the valve Enbridge ended up shutting off the pipeline before the activists had a chance to follow through with their plan but they were arrested charged with felonies for damaging the pipeline\nThe case has gotten a lot of national attention because the activists were going to try to use what's known as a necessity defense at trial\nThat is they want it to argue that climate changes so urgent and that government officials aren't doing enough about it that they needed to act now by shutting off as pipe line\nAnd this was a bit of a surprise yesterday because they never made their argument to the jury\nWhat ended up happening to everyone's surprise is that the judge equipment the activists before they even took the stand to make their case so\nAnd and then the defense attorneys asked the judge for acquittal arguing there was insufficient evidence the judge said yes I agree that they didn't actually damage the pipeline in this case just a lock and so he quit at them and then everyone home what are the activists have to say\nWell you know they were disappointed that they didn't get to talk about climate change in courts um our colleague Dan Crocker was in the court House yesterday and he spoke to the activists after they acquitted here's one of them and only Johnston\nI Am disappointed that we did not get to put on trial that we hope for you know we very much wanted her doctors to be able to hear from our expert witnesses uh we did this action because the problem with climate change is so urgent that we have to start cutting that tar sands pipelines down now\nSo Johnson and the other activists did want to tell the jurors and the judge that but they also said hey we're happy we don't have to go to jail and they also said they would not rule out more acts of civil disobedience and a future any idea of how the outcome of this case could affect other cases and how they're handling court I put\nThat question to some legal scholars and the fact that this case went all the way to trial and that a judge was allowing them to use a necessity defense is a big deal so even though it didn't end up playing out because the judges surprise acquittal\nThat case got a lot of attention nationally and there were other situations where climate activists are trying to use the defense in cases of civil disobedience\nBut this is really uncharted territory so we really don't know how different courts might respond to this and one thing we do know is that a lot of people here are concerned that\nIf there are more protests like this it could be a problem for energy companies in for law enforcement because Enbridge is due to build a new pipeline right what are they thinking about it ... into the church of talking about it right now especially because\nSupport for Minnesota Public

... what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what made them\nA and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred a rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it was stopped rising benchmark rate between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there so\nThe way I understand it said usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right are there fewer than inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at fifty year low so there's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation\nPressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market\nEconomy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today's sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe has cooled it bit as have emerging markets and the IMF gave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S and China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by to sell off\nFor virtually all sectors of the market sold off today a wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this ball market in fact\nDeck index lost four percent of its value today and that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tech lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech a very tough day but it is just the beginning of a long downward trend for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the doubt down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point where investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough\nThat the interest rates they're paying you starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another\nCrack at it and we'll see what happens we'll see that as NPR's John Ydstie Thanks John You're welcome [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThere was a term being
