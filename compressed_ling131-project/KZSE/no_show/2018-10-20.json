America\nAnd some of the biggest issues that we're dealing with or things like health care and the absolutely astronomical costs to that people are paying right now\nUh people are talking about what's going on in Washington when it comes to corruption and the money in politics I and people are absolutely concerned about what's going on in the environment not just here in Minnesota but also the environment I in a grand scale climate change and and what would you do about that why would you be the best person\nWell I I mean for a number of reasons uh when it comes to health care we actually have a plan I'm I Want Medicare for all I and as it is right now there's not really a plan on the Republican side it's mostly just reasons why Medicare for all isn't good enough but the reality is what we have right now is not good enough\nAnd we need a plan and right now Medicare for all is our best plan forward and it's the only plan out there that truly make sure that nobody falls through the cracks okay sure that nobody's left uninsured\nOkay we'll get to more on health care and minute Tom Emmer why should you get another term well I\nThink if you look at its results I that's why\nA

country was one point seven percent\nOr you can't do anything if you're academy is not growing you can't say you can't see people's lives the quality of our lives improve without economic prosperity what's happened Mike\nNow as of ah the last quarter for point two percent economic growth we were told we were never going to see that again third quarter of this year I Believe the Atlanta fed just said four percent and they're projecting for the the first quarter of next year\nOr five percent or better I I think the question that people have to ask themselves and they are asking themselves before they vote this year as do I feel better off\nThan I did two years ago do I feel the prospects are better for my children and grandchildren are in the answer's yes and I'm asking for the opportunity to go back to Washington and continue what we started\nWe did it as well or better than any other state in the union and I I just suggested my colleague I'd run a business I Know what an added to the cost and you started out by saying a to point to personal income tax and they threw in six percent tax over here at the end of the day you will never have enough to fund this you have got to restore\nThe ability of individuals to make choices and of the state to make sure that that basic essential benefit packages available to them\nI provided for one of my kids when he was twenty two years old it was a one hundred dollar a month policy today that same policy because we've let\nThe federal government and the bureaucrats get involved in this thing and we've taken it away from Minnesotans who know how to take care of themselves as that same policy is going to be three hundred four hundred dollars for that a college age kids will do homework\nCongressman let me ask you though because Republicans have the house the Senate and the White House and and you couldn't get the bill passed\nWell that's a little that's a little misleading because yes you have like all those kinds of don't control it is ... and not to quibble with you or if you think about it we got a good majority in the house and we have passed the solutions out of the house\nSenate completely different uh animal the Senate with only one or two seat majority and with John McCain's illness you need all the things you have it and you gotta have sixty votes so for people to suggest while you got this

percent this is a crisis and then our farm our communities where the prices are depressed and they've got some major challenges I it's even bigger I mean you look there's some reports out there that say compared to the general population\nOur farming community say experience suicide four or five times what the what the normal population does so\nBefore you start going down that road was socialized medicine I Would suggest to my colleague that he should probably read the bill the other thing that people need to understand when they when we get into these I Believe your campaign on details\nWhen somebody says I Would like to compromise it is a catch phrase that has been used in politics for many years\nAnd most people on the street are very frustrated with it because I always tell the story you know when my wife and I got married Jackie wanted for kids I wanted three we compromise might we have seven alright it works great in marriage the problem with it in government and with people who campaign like this\nIs if everybody gets everything they want and everybody that's being asked to pay for it gets a whole bunch of things they don't necessarily need and we can't afford\nI don't even know what he means when he says public option I think the better thing is once again restored Minnesotans ability and I understand the ... that you were living somewhere else at the time but had you been here inexperienced with Minnesota was able to do before the Affordable CARE Act\nI think you'd be you'd be with me on this issue\nIn time to let you respond if you are\nYou know I I wasn't here at the time I was in the military and I was serving\nSuicide rate and I've lost friends I've lost colleagues to this this is an incredibly important issue but the reality is we can cover health care as well as full body care with a Medicare for all bill and\nAnd I think that that is incredibly important when we talked about the stresses that people are experiencing when we talk about why suicide is up ... has to do with the fact that we're doing so poorly right now I everyone that I Know who has a college education that's my age also has a debt I\n... the people I Know who are my age that people who are coming up I'm twenty eight years old we are experiencing incredible economic stress right now because even though the economy might be building when you look at the stock market\nIt's not booming for us there is\nLow unemployment rates but there's also an incredible amount of people who only have part time work this is a huge issue that we're experiencing and we don't have enough money to pay for this health insurance and you're going to buy a\nMonth after month just keeping our fingers crossed that nothing will crop up that's exactly what I'm doing I don't have health insurance and I know that it is easy for somebody like Tom Emmer who does have an pass\nThe health insurance to say that our system right now is good or that the system that we used to have was fine but there were certainly problems in it and everybody knows that we didn't create a CIA because the current system was functional\nNow was a CIA perfect absolutely not there are problems and if I thought the AC a with perfect then I Would not be advocating for Medicare for all but here I Am advocating for something else because what we've done hasn't worked so far we have got to do something because of this is a crisis and all of these issues are connected\nEmmer let me ask you about that 'cause you you said he wanted to talk about big issues in the big ...\nSupport comes from

urban homework dot org backslash donate\nI get frustrated 'cause you took his words and you turn it into something else what he said was their own opportunities out there for every one what he said was there are people that are under employed they're employed part time\nI don't know what Mr Todd is doing or where he's looking but that's simply is not a fact today in this economy you have seven million jobs available people are starting at Fifteen dollars an hour they're earning Eighteen within three months at jobs all over the place\nManufacturing and seen a resurgent was when we were told her the last administration that's never going to happen there are jobs everywhere and if someone wants to make choices that affect their life\nThat's up to them now when it comes to health insurance I can tell you\nHe clearly doesn't understand what we have to deal with I got a large family but I raise fantastic health insurance I got to say I got through Congress\nAnd they were caught me Twenty one hundred dollars a month with a six thousand dollar deductible\nYou know what we didn't take it we stayed with something called met a share which is a program that was able we make choices and we keep our our uh our costs down I Know I Know my wife when he said\nFantastic healthcare is in the other room role in her eyes the only thing that he doesn't understand is this great government program which he now wants to recreate is something called Medicare for all the one that's already failed that both Democrats and Republicans agree\nYou know it wasn't a thousand dollars a month and it was two to three to four thousand dollars a month people with families were being asked\nTo take twenty to twenty five thousand dollars of their income annually to pay for insurance premiums that they may or may not need to access for the coverage and then we had a five to ten thousand dollar deductible that was created\nThat did not exist before the Affordable CARE Act and bite your silence on it you either aren't aware of that or you know that and so\nThe ideas will just call the same ... it's the same animal by a different name will call it Medicare for all and by the way it's so dangerous what you're doing\nBecause if you were ever to enact that you wouldn't Bernie Sanders what you would end up doing is you would bring the whole system down ... even the people right now that rely on Medicare for their health care they would lose the option I'll tell you why\nBecause young people that you want to bring into this program or the healthiest and we you would use the least amount\nOf healthcare services it's our seniors that are in their last years of life that need it and require the most\nAnd you know what's gonna happen when you have limited resources you will take away their options you will take away their ability to access the care they and their families so dearly need because they want them and their golden years and that's not right ...\nThat's the timeline and so we've seen a lot of improvement recently with these trade agreements and I'm confident we can get the job done by spring\nCollin Peterson what do you think on the president's trade stance well\nI think that um the a renegotiation of NAFTA we were concerned about but we came out of that are not losing anything we didn't really gain\nBut on the case of China um I don't see any upside for agriculture in what's being done in China um I understand the president's what he's trying to do here he's trying to get these jobs back to that we shipped to China Twenty years ago a what we should've done at that time was not ...\nWhich I voted against a because we knew at the time they were going to require U.S companies that went to try and I were going to have to give fifty one percent of the company to the Chinese and they got forty nine percent and that's been the situation shall we shipped five six million jobs to China\nAnd those people are the jobs went into the people in the country that we're doing agriculture went into the city and agriculture picked up those markets are but this fight is not over those egg markets are so I I just I don't see it I Hope I'm wrong but\nI I don't see an upside on this I see only a downside and I hope this gets over sooner rather than later\nThat's Collin Peterson he's the DFL congressman from Minnesota seventh district in western Minnesota he's seeking another turn this year his Republican opponent Dave Hughes is here as well he ran two years ago against the congressman\nA congressman Peterson all the Democrats in the house voted against the tax bill that passed last year was that a bad deal for people in the seventh district\nWell I don't know I don't know that it was necessarily a bad deal uh my biggest problem was it was not paid for and we were told well don't worry this was going to pay for itself\nWhile we just found out two days ago that the deficit has gone up Seventeen percent and everybody that commented on this said that the main reason is because of the tax cuts\nThe part of the tax cuts that I liked and I would have supported\nIs the corporate reduction or our corporate rate was out of whack with the rest of the world and I would have easily supported going to Fifteen Percent on the corporate\nAnd not all the rest of the stuff that was added end of this bill a so these pass through the changes I think are going to come back to haunt us we just found out today that the elevators now are not going to be able to do that\nOf the individual area anybody has a big family when they go to fill out their taxes this year are going to come out with a big surprise when they find out that this thing that was touted as a big win for them because of consolidating these Saturday doctrine and the exemptions with a big family you're going to lose\nIf you're in a state like Minnesota where they've limit as the state and local tax deductions you're going to lose so there's not all positive and this but the biggest problem is a you know I think the corporations have responded than it's been good\nBut you know we did not um they said this is going to pay for itself\nI was skeptical and from what I can tell it did not pay for itself\n... would you have voted for the bill if you had been in Congress\nAbsolutely and where to start with what common just said uh when when he voted against it last fall he was asked by a number of journalists why you voted against it and I recall that the biggest reason was because he didn't hear enough from us from his constituents to vote for it you didn't have anything more thoughtful to say that and the fact of the matter is we have seen since then\nThat every economic indicator that uh people in Congress look out for the health of the economy nationwide whether you're talking about I'm\nA ... a workforce participation rate unemployment rate a home ownership rate entrepreneurship\nGDP Growth every single economic indicator wage growth all of them are up and they're out dramatically since then and so a to point out a couple of things that might theoretically come to pass that might be slightly negative\nOr it just shows bad analysis and bad conclusions on the part of common and I absolutely would have voted for it and I'm ready for round two in January two thousand Nineteen because this first round the tax cuts so was better for the corporate side than it was for the for the individual side although it benefits the ... the nation at large or an hour ready to do our part to and so all support that going forward\nAre you worried about the deficit at all because it is up Seventeen percent over last year and it's on track to hit a ... trillion\nSupport comes from urban home works stable home suffer long

donate\nWalking about it but where where it was their concern during the Obama first term where we had four straight years one trillion plus dollar a year deficits or I Am consistently against deficit spending I Believe the national day of the United states is one of the greatest challenges facing our country\nAnd so one of the reasons I'm running as I Am a conservative and we've got to reign in spending spending is the key to it Collins said at the tax cut wasn't paid for that or a false narrative you pay for it by reducing spending and there's nobody in Congress with the exceptions who has an appetite for reducing spending and that's what I wanted to\nCollin Peterson what would you do about the federal deficit\nWell I have been consistent on this uh I have supported the balanced budget amendment for many sessions in Congress\nI have voted against some of these big huge um omnibus bills I voted against the tarp I voted against the stimulus I voted against all of those things that I drove up to the deficits in the Obama years\nBut the second term of Obama's presidency of the deficit actually came down significantly\nAnd now the first two years in the Trump presidency they've gone back up\nSo you know this idea that ah that they're going to cut spending to pay for these tax cuts that's what we've heard you know over and over again a but nobody ever as they've said nobody ever wants to cut spending and one of the concerns of was raised by some people in our party which I didn't really\nYou know of such a surprise to was that the Republicans intended to costs Social Security and Medicare to pay for the tax cuts and what happens two days ago Mitch McConnell said that very thing\nSocial Security and Medicare in order to pay to get the deficit down I can tell you this I Am absolutely one hundred percent against any cops and Medicare and it costs and Social Security that's the last thing we should be doing in this economy Dave he was what about you on Medicare and Social Security\nOr one quick thing on the taxpayer when Khalid denied devoted debated two years ago he laid out and are televised debates and specific things\nAre under which provisions under which he could vote foreign support tax cuts\nThat was two years ago that tax bill last fall laid out most of that on the corporate side and he voted against it so I think that's a case where he went with his caucus instead of doing what he told the voters he would do two years ago with regard to medicate into Social Security I don't believe that the Republicans were talking about making any cuts whatsoever to the benefit to the benefits of the beneficiaries\nWhat they're talking about is doing things that are a behind the scenes that are a duplicate duplicate of spending for instance I Know that in um uh one of those two they're talking about doing away with a dual pay out of\nA a disability and unemployment doesn't make sense that you would pay both and so that's a part of of what the Republicans have talked about\nBut they're absolutely not talking about reducing in real terms or the benefits of the beneficiaries are nor would I support that ah we're looming we're looking at a looming crisis coming up in the future twenty twenty six for Medicare to go in solving the twenty twenty twenty thirty four for Social Security\nAnd the problem is members of Congress including colon have never done anything about it than twenty eight years calling us not let on the subject and he has not achieved any success at sitting down and getting the hard work started of reforming those two programs and we need to do that sooner rather than later because those dates are are coming up quickly\nWell how do you reform the programs without cutting benefits though\nA there's a host of ways to do and you have to sit down and get to work started but unfortunately a in years past when people have talked about sitting down and be getting the discussion or they get all sorts of a a a pain from the other side for even talking about sitting down and talk to you so ah we've got to sit\nSessions they just want to kick the can down the road and not do anything about it and pretend that it all is well Mike this this is I think need to point out of the biggest flaw in Congress and that is you cannot change these big programs without it being bipartisan\nIf it's just not going to work ... you know the farm bill whatever it is you got to be bipartisan you gotta have by an from both parties\nWe did limit benefits and we didn't cut anybody under the current system but in the nineties we raise the retirement age\nAnd you go talk to anybody that has a retired recently and they're going to tell you that they they had to go to sixty six sixty seven before they could get their full retirement that was a change that was made in the nineties that I supported it was done on a bipartisan basis it was done out in the future so it doesn't affect anybody for Twenty years\nA bus that were changes that were made and that's the kind of things that are being talked about again so there are people talking about cutting benefits are there are things like that on the table\nAnd ah I just don't think with all the problems that seniors are having right now with these low interest rates they help one aspect of the economy economy but they are killing senior citizens that have savings and they're not making any money you know on those savings unless they go into the stock market", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Rochester", "day": "20"}
