where do you most agree with the president and tell us if there are any areas where you disagree with the\nYou know I I I agree with their President Trump's his uh his economic response ah I I agree with his uh he's got really good business sense and\nHe's propelling this so that it ... the tax cutting JOBS Act have really benefited the eighth congressional district and ah as I'm going around the district that's what I'm hearing the tax cutting JOBS Act have benefited so many manufacturing facilities and small businesses like the one my brothers and I own\nSome of the places that I disagree with uh I've talked about this earlier had I been in Congress just two years ago when our president's first budget went for like\nI Would have been the first one to stand up and talk about is zero funding for the great lakes resorts of initiative that was in that initial budget\nThe great lakes are part of our economy and I would have fought fiercely to ensure that that are funding or is fully funded and so those are some things that that I Would uh really fight on behalf of the district voters\nThe other thing is ... corporation I Know that a President Trump wanted to get into the with the

R. go dot com\nMy good friend and somebody I think we have an excellent marriage ... fry a but these are ridiculous nearly nuclear the decoration natural well\nLet me just ask a question on sort of on this broad a character issues that came from a listener when you're facing a tough decision what personal experience do you use to help you decide what the next step should be and uh Pete stubborn start with you\nSo as a police officer small business owner husband and father ... there's tough choices almost on a daily basis you go back to your experience and you do what's right or experience matters life experience matters and as a police officer for example in the city do if we had to make instantaneous decisions\nAnd those good decisions you make in those in those uh urgent moments you have to rely on your experience to make them and uh when you have a experience as a police officer some of those really immediate really life a life\nAltering decisions have to be made instantaneously so I go back to my life I go back to the experiences that I have ah been blessed with in my life to make those decisions Mike\nImage I put myself in someone else's shoes and that's easy enough for me to do because I have dealt with a great deal that verse in my life when I was\nSixteen years old I'm ... my life is pretty good at that point my came home from track practice on march Eighteenth I met a family member or shoot himself trying to take his own life and eleven months after that my mother was murdered by a separate family member who took his own life then as well\nAnd I've struggled through four years after that and that was a period of time when I got that ticket and you know I made it through um but I recognize that night\nProgramming is supported by near or a new kind of

myself in someone else's shoes and holding myself accountable to the values that I've always grown up with that I've learned through good times and bad is how I make decisions\nLet me ask another question from a listener or the listener said since the un panel released its a climate change report a couple of weeks ago that called for really some big changes in in a hurry to make a difference what if anything would you support to address climate change and Pete's daughter start with you\nYeah I read that report to Mike and and uh it's an issue that we have to look at it I Know that a drill neither ... nor hires a scientist\nOr we have to look at what are the causes and how can we reduce the emissions and I think that it's a it's a great healthy discussion because at the scientific level\nUh there's there's some discussions on what we can put forth that ah can ah can slow the process and uh I'm open to to discussions and in in a and learn from the scientist because like I said another job or scientists\nJordan image climate change is real\nAh there is no discussion anymore and there hasn't been frankly discussion for a long time\nOr the overwhelming majority of scientists believe one thing about this and that it's happening that it's caused by\nGreenhouse gases like a CEO to and like methane and ah that is largely a caused by human activity right and so we have to be able to number one or mitigate the damage as that are already being done I think that that looks like reducing\nA greenhouse gases sequestering carbon or making sure that we uh you know continue to advance a sensible and sustainable um\nBecause we also need to invest I think in a renewable forms of energy to continue to diversify the energy basket\nAnd beyond that were also frankly at this point because people have been dragging their feet on this issue for so long going to have to look at adaptation techniques I think that that's the real a dilemma here and and everybody every expert agrees on this there is no conversation to have any more [noise] ...\nWhy I I I'll reared ear reiterate would have just said I said we have to look at things to to to make sure that we leave or not only this country but this world in better shape and we got it and so uh I'm I'm always willing to take a look at things and and I'm a perpetual learner\nOr another question from a listener are any new gun laws needed after recent mass shootings for example do support background checks on all gun sales and I think this person is looking for a yes or no answer Jordan which there with you yes you support background checks to just ...\nHad background checks to make as a police officer for twenty three years [noise] ah I can say this well off duty in Nineteen Ninety five I was shot in the head in downtown Duluth food years later while on duty a perpetrator in a hostage situation cut the jump on me\nHold a hand gun within five feet pulled the trigger by the grace of God at malfunction and I was literally fighting for my life I still support our Second Amendment to have a lot of individual law abiding citizens the right to keep and bear arms there is not a person that I Know that once a career criminal\nA drug addict somebody who's going through crisis or others that should possess or have a firearm we need to keep those firearms out of those criminals hands and one of the things that I'm very proud of in St Louis county we have a we have a um a lead prosecutor our county attorney mark Ruben who who will not\nA played down any gun crime and I'm very proud of that\nUh the importance of reducing violence in our in our communities and so in St Louis county there's no please don't gun crimes Mike Jordan\nBut there are large loopholes in our background check system and I think that that's the spirit of the question that was asked and that wasn't the ants that we got from Pete Stauber dinner a spending two hundred thousand dollars to beat me right now and I think it's in part because I'm most gun owners recognize that we can have sensible\nAh reforms that protect people I mean we've seen now a mass shootings in Las Vegas or about a year ago\nThere were four hundred and fifty people shot within five minutes because somebody was able to go by multiple assault style weapons the outfit than what bump stocks and high capacity magazines and direct carnage on the streets of Las Vegas and I think that in a civilized society we can have\nBoth a protection of the second amendment I'm an avid hunter it had been my whole life have plenty against myself and also sensible gun reform\nThe the fact of the matter is I think a drone I agree and that is\nWell it's like he's he wants to have background checks for private sales so\nWell let's talk about private sales
