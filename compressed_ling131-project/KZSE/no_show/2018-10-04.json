and I'm David Greene in Culver City California President Trump's tax returns are back in the headlines\nNot because they have been released but because of bombshell report from the New York times is renewing calls for them to be made public the report claimed the Trump engaged in suspect tax games a lawyer for Trump has denied any wrongdoing\nDoubles understand what this means we have Andrea Bernstein with us she is the co host of Trump's ink a podcast it's a co production of WNYC\nAnd ProPublica she's with us from our studios in New York Andrew mornings you talk to you yeah it's good to talk to you too so let's try and sort this out I mean the New York times is reporting that Donald Trump received what's the equivalent today of more than four hundred million dollars from his dad's real estate empire in that much of this cash came\nThrough these dubious tax schemes back in the nineties I mean I guess the first question I have is do we know whether Trump might still be involved in questionable tax practices well\nThis is indeed an open question and the New York times was able to document what they had because they received hundreds of tax returns from either Fred Trump Donald Trump's father or his company then we're able to trace the flow of cash for that reason\nFor example there was a set of buildings in the outer boroughs of New York in Brooklyn and queens worth millions of dollars that Fred Trump appears to have transferred to his children without paying taxes and without creating any public trace\nSo there is no way we would know if such a thing was happening now with out corresponding documents now\nThere are some suggestive things we do know one is that our colleagues at ProPublica reported last year that Donald Trump had transferred in an apartment in one of his Manhattan buildings to his son Eric\n... for a price much below market without seeing the president's tax returns we don't know how they handled that but it was an out word in ...\nAre times traced to Fred Trump and his children Donald and his siblings\nSo who was actually looking into this and then the rest of your well [laughter] a lot of people the recent uh uh revelations that came out in the New York times or being examined by tax authorities both at the state and city level in New York\nUh in addition to that we know that prosecutors in the southern district have been following up on\nThe things that Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to last summer which had to do with tax fraud as well so the president's former lawyer correct and then in addition to that the New York uh attorney general is looking at the Trump Foundation and one of the things\nThat we've already learned from her investigation is that the walls between the foundation and the Trump Organization were ... non existent so it's possible that there might be more to learn their now on top of all that\nThere's the house Democrats who said they want to see the president's current tax returns if they take control over the house they could demand to see them\n[noise] so a lot swirling your um but I mean when we've reported on on the president's tax practices in the past them in ... ... a lot of people said look there's this\nThere's there's tax avoidance in a legal way and then there's illegal tax evasion and that it's often murky um what's actually happening so I mean is it possible that there might be no go for your for the president\nIt is possible that there might be no legal fallout and of course he and his lawyers are maintaining that he's done nothing wrong and that this was all looked at in some cases decades ago and cleared\nA there are a number of things that are extremely puzzling and one of the situations that the New York times pointed out was a company called all county building and maintenance which was basically a ...\nThen mark up prices of things like ... an air conditioners instilled for Trump apartments and then give the markup to Donald Trump and his siblings with no parents tax consequences\nThere was also something that the Trump seemed to have done frequently and and we know from our reporting on Trump Inc the gas up they're still doing today which is when it is in their interest to puff up a value of a property they'll say oh this is the biggest the best\nThey do so it sounds like the president right but there in disputes with tax authorities around the country right now for example claiming some of their golf courses are are really worth very little in an effort to get lower taxes so some of the techniques described in the article we know are continuing through through today\nAll right so a lot of threats a lot of investigations to follow here um but one question is whether those tax returns will ever actually been made public and then what happened this election could see a lot about that part Andrea Bernstein is the co host of the Trump podcast editor thanks a lot\nThank you [noise] this is NPR News I'm just coming off at eleven it's counter stories of conversation by people of color today a look at the Trump administration's proposed new rules on immigration and Brett Kavanaugh hearings junior\nPresident Trump's nominee to lead the Census Bureau was back on Capitol Hill yesterday if confirmed he'd have to join multiple lawsuits against the Census Bureau over a new controversial citizenship question on the form Here's NPR's Hansi Lo on\nIn twenty twenty the Trump Administration is going to ask every household is this person a citizen of the United states administration says it needs responses to that question to better enforce the voting rights act protections against racial discrimination dozens of states cities and other groups have about six lawsuits to try and get it removed\nWorms you're going to order and when\nThe nomination of a new Census Bureau director raised the citizenship question having understanding of something as fundamental as how many citizens and non citizens are in the country I think that's essential senators Steve Gaines Republican from Montana as President Trump's nominee Steven Dillingham if he supports including the question on the census\nSenator I ah have no plans to voice an opinion on that question I think it will not be advisable in my position if I'm confirmed to be the director of the Census Bureau\nDillingham said the courts will decide if the citizenship question stays or goes when that decision will come may not clear right now the Trump Administration is trying to get the Supreme Court to weigh in on the lawsuits the administration wants to stop the plaintiff lawyers from questioning to key officials behind the question including commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nWhat are they hiding why such extreme measures to block the essential deposition\nLiz oh young is a census consulted for the New York immigration coalition there one of the group suing the Trump Administration because Census Bureau

six o'clock tonight\nRight here on NPR News the forty five It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm David Greene and we're going to visit rocket now it was once the capital of ISIS territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nUnder the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is the stadium did ISIS use to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there\nEarly in the years shortly after he was captured from ISIS Steve Rogers seems to be coming back to life step by step is still one rubble removal being done\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious as the shops are open on their first floors of a lot of buildings is sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops\nAnd they say there are more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water or electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now\nBut people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look\nCompletely desolate from the damage from the air strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states that controls that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little aces here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nThere was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for [noise]\nAnd some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in rock searches bomb removal but also education programs and that\nReally worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again now President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet\nAnd here's the bottom line would that Steve if you don't provide people with their basic needs for living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass round so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue NPR's\nTom Bowman is in Iraq

confidential material and make a decision on the nomination before our first vote on friday Brett Kavanaugh's nomination has stirred passions not normally seen over Supreme Court nomination\n[noise]\nI knew a lot from borders today found whether you support or oppose the Kavanaugh nomination ... a lot of political affiliation opposition to cabinet stood at Seventy one percent among Democrats supporting them supporting\nSent this hour we're going to discuss that political divide and how it affects the Supreme Court joining me now are two experts these Huck is a professor of law at the University of Chicago law school and the author of a new book how to save a constitutional democracy welcome professor\nIdealistic\nAnd Laura undercover ... is a professor of law at Cornell law school welcome professor also thank you very much we also want to hear from you has had the Kavanaugh hearings affected your image of the Supreme Court\nDo see the court as above politics and impartial still joining our conversation at six join our conversation at six five one to two seven six thousand or one eight hundred two for two to eight to eight six five one to two seven six thousand\nOf these I'm going to start with you we've seen contentious Supreme Court hearings before the there's even a verb affiliated with it to be Bork\nDoes this moment strike you as more politically oppositional than usual\n[noise] I think the general electrical is oppositional cause degree um the effect off divisions between the two major political parties are great at any time in history\n[noise] do you think that this will how will this affect the Supreme Court itself is it playing playing out there if whether Kavanaugh gets nominated or not whether he not nominate everybody gets put on the Supreme Court or not do you think that the political division that it's happening right now will affect the court itself\n[noise] the court is held at higher regard by Americans or other national institutions such as the regard that Americans hold ... doesn't\nTraditional cases for example\nBush the goal a case that effectively side of the two thousand presidential election\nDidn't know how to great effect upon levels of public health of and the cool nonetheless it was the last Twenty years the secular trend in ... and the Supreme Court has been declining\nThe entire time right now is one of people not listening and now we have the me too movement and people again aren't listening you know that that's the deep message and now we have a view of many these senators aren't listening you know and\nThere's this there's a very heightened emotional nature of this particular political moment that I think is crystallized into this nomination and we'll go forward\nA and potentially damage the court if indeed uh um well really if either happens it might but particularly if someone is a place on that court who is viewed as a\nAn unabashed partisan which is unfortunately what many saw in the ah his testimony\nYou're listening to NPR News I'm Stephanie Curtis sitting in for carrying Miller we are discussing politics and the Supreme Court right now my guests are Laura undercover she's a law professor at Cornell law in Ithaca New York\nAnd disease hockey is a professor of law at the University of Chicago law school he's the author of how to save a constitutional democracy\nAnd I want to hear from you do you think that the Supreme Court can stay above the ... the political fray do you think that you are losing I have you lost any faith in the Supreme Court call one eight hundred two for two\nFive one to two seven six thousand Jason has called from Forrest Lake Hi Jason\nHello you know I kind of wanted to talk about some of the procedural changes that happen\nTo the set it which is adding to the divisions um when bronco bomber was president he was appointed in lower court justices and Mitch McConnell basically blocked everything he was trying to do So Harry Reid\nA in exasperation change the rules so that it\nRequires just a simple majority is to uh come from a lower court justice that continued into the Trump era now Donald Trump is a a point to a lower court judges and they're just getting passed through the left and right is just stacking the court that direction\nBut Mitch McConnell changed the rules for Supreme Court justices so that would only requires a simple majority\nWhen Kagan and a sort of Myra was confirmed it required sixty votes right now with all their requires fifty one votes so uh I think that's really adding to the um\nThe divisions in this country and the uh contentiousness of these nominations by ...\nThank you for calling in Jason IVs do you think that having a simple majority has made it more politically ... would have been if we still need to get two thirds vote\n[noise] I think it's helpful to step back and ask why are the traditionally has become a very politically froze and I think that there are a couple of reasons for\nThat and here um I I think my position as a little different from Laura ... over or maybe inferring too much from some of the things she sat in my youth or the court has to take decisions that are often not all the time and by prior little crafts\n... an issue divides local\nAnd Puckett lights up to the Supreme Court is that reasonable people can differ on the way back to the little directs once in a while and in those cases particularly constitutional cases that are often ... questions of political morality\nThat have to be brought to bat so the ... in my view is situated uh says it inevitably deciding questions off political morality that often have a process of complex you know it's been through\nAh through the through uh uh the beginning of the American republic it was\nIt was true in the cold I'm Down in cases like a drug called ... the case that are attempting to settle the question if the state just blocks from the United states a prior to the civil war for the call itself is deciding questions that on one view a political in nature\nAnd what happens um um I think first on the rights but then on the left is that there are a slice of a question that predictably come in front of the quotes\nThat are of great interest to parts off a partisan coalition to the best example is not as ... motion became something that was a of vital and central interest to a religious and evangelical groups typically on the Republican side\nUm with respect to many of the Republicans are donors there are issues about the courts treatment off business I'm a\nA possibility off a exposure of a corporate interests to log large scale liability through things like ... and they're all sort of great interest right the left of the time has come to have another\nBut I think they came late to the game that have been much less effective in organizing politically so in that context where the courts decided political issues and there's political issues are entirely pieces off a Republican and democratic coalition that they're\nPicking up things that the Republican and democratic coalition really care about I think it is incredibly unlikely records which ... has become politicized and the way a ...\nIt would not have become the object of political fights in the public sphere in the way that it has now become ... and I and and while I agree ah ah with the caller's\nDescription off the way that the Senate rules have evolved data time\nI think that what he's describing is isn't all ... off the cool polarization of the quotes a seeming politicized ...\nI think it's an effect off the kinds of issues the court is deciding on the way those issues have been hitched to interest groups on the right to fast and then on the left\nLauren does that sound right to you ... question I guess right\nUm well I Would say that the court is always decided a politically highly contentious issues yes indeed [laughter] [noise] and they are are always facing questions of political morality or\nA fundamental values or however you want to place it cases that are not I mean there are some cases that don't deal with those questions but usually those kinds of questions are involved otherwise it would not be\nAt a case in the Supreme Court so but that truly has been the case for a ... from the time as the court was found that it was a controversy\nNew deal struggle or we're talking about the slavery struggle or or various other issues so\nAt the political nature of it is not something that is new\nUm I think that what we're dealing that the particular item that uh has become more does and he has this is I mentioned before is the political climate that exist generally\nAnd the fact that we have a nominee who\nHas now apparently indicated that there are a large parts of the political spectrum and so forth are Democrats Clinton files whoever you want to call it a who are he views as personal enemies that that that that that's a different\nKind of a situation in my mind on on the caller's question about the super majority I think yes I mean this is one of those situations where [laughter] you know it's a it's it's instrumental the uh the left decides that they get their employees\nOr forties through they're going to require only a a a bare majority and then it comes back to bite them of course when the other side becomes powerful and decides to uh\nThe same thing with the Supreme Court but it it that issue I think is is actually very important because actually if you if the governmental apparatus the president whoever it is the set powerful senators involved no\nThat they must in fact to get a nominee through by a particular\nKind of vote a that is going to for some kind of moderation at least to succeed it's going to force some kind of moderation in choice and with the absence of that yes I think that the I think the caller is correct and the doors\nThe different calculus different political calculus in this process this is NPR News I'm Stephanie Curtis I'm sitting in for carrying mail or are we are talking about the Supreme Court and politics and whether\nAn impartial Supreme Court is something that you still believe in that the people still believe and we are going to our phone number if you want to call in and six five one to two seven six thousand or one eight hundred two for two to eight to eight\nWe are going to go off to the news and we get back we got a lot of calls on line we want to hear from people but right now let's head to filter Carty and get some news\nStephanie the White House says it has received the FBI or supplemental background investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and senators are reviewing it for a vote\nA very difficult long in the ordinary costs of things\nAnd it was it's difficulty was exacerbates\nHead in the context of a high profile proceeding like a Supreme Court confirmation\nUm the difficulty with not so much that there's a presumption of innocence not say\nSomething something about the concept is used when someone is a potentially subject to criminal penalties I'm a common are applying for jobs there there is no presumption of innocence on applies for a job so I'm not sure about the right way\nOf thinking about things um Rother um there is a deeper question if what happens when an instance of sexual alleged sexual misconduct because\nUsually away from other people's eyes and they're all competing\nCompeting uh accounts that the about from usually the ... and the woman\nAnd what happened in the cabinet nominations is that is that is that disagreements with ... about this question this question\nHe gets treated in the public's become sharply in deeply polarized\nAnd whatever else a nomination affects all the water that clearly Schiff has been to make the question of sexual violence appreciation\n...\nLet's go to the phones Terry in West St Paul has been waiting patiently and have a point that I Want to hear I Terry hey\nWho um you know we're obviously in the middle of a constitutional crisis Eighteen years ago we're certainly in one would be the more serious consequences when the Bush going a bit was tied up in Florida\nAnd uh after the Supreme Court ruled against Gore he graciously conceded to who are President Bush and the ... of keeping the country together\nI think Brett Kavanaugh has every ... every reason to um withdraws nominees were certainly other very qualified candidates his wife is not ruined you can\nDo many jobs we can have on Fox News the other ... other university a student loan were practicing in a long haul and this would help the country back together again there are certainly many people on a on President Trump's list but still that position\nThank you thanks for calling Harry Laurent do think that we aren't is this a constitutional crisis\n[laughter] uh I think it's a constitutional crisis in the sense that our image and our view of the individuals who sit on the court is being seriously challenged because we have never\nI mean that the Clarence Thomas a situation is a good example Justice Thomas or there was a very contentious hearing about something not\nAs serious as this I guess most of the day but nonetheless\nDid to the court after a a ... after a contentious vote and\nUh I don't believe that that caused any long term damage to the court I don't think anyone seriously would I Would say that um but this case is different for all the reasons we've been discussing and\nUh so therefore should or should there be some other kind of outfit is outcome as the caller indicates should he\nWithdraw for the good of the country it's it's interesting in that this uh this concern for self and group this what I Would call the tribal is to\nA phenomenon that we're experiencing at the moment across the political spectrum is not one that yields compromise or consideration about\nLarger societal cost whether it's the left or the writer wherever it is it's the frame of reference is simply one's own belief one's own group one zone a trajectory and\nSo therefore it's highly unlikely that in this environment he would withdraw in fact it would be seen as weakness I Am sure\nUh by very prominent members in the uh uh supporters that he has that just to somehow\nFold his tend to say he's doing it in the interest of the larger society this would be seen as as some sort of ... and I'm disgusting weakness so [laughter] we're in we're in different times and uh I think it's swept up this particular a nomination\nAs he's what do you think do you think we're in a constitutional crisis that could be resolved if Brett Kavanaugh I've just stepped aside or whether or Democrats just voted for him and put them on the bench and it would all be solved if we just went our ways and acting like it didn't happen\nI I think the center for constitutional system is under great pressure from or what Laura ... tribalism um and I I guess what I Would call 'em\nA extreme um possums polarization or not say systemic problem on its problems on the frame of did not anticipate so very famously James Madison and arguing for a competition and the\nFederalist Papers said look that the benefits of the system that we're creating as the ... not going to have\nNational level political factions much and uh I act in ways that are um undesirable yeah within a less\nThan a decade uprising about Madison was instrumental in the creation of one of two major political parties the constitution is not designed to operate in a while to political parties in St Louis operate in the world of political policies but there are certain conditions off\nA policy polarization that make governments extremely difficult\nAnd if one wants to talk about a constitutional crisis I think it's a deep conflict between a political polarization\nAnd a comforted offensive comes to social structures that are not designed conceded lean not designed the conditions of hypothesis yet\nThat's the root of the problem um I my sense um so the question of whether ... could would will withdraw is the famous Lawrence I I I I think that that's extremely unlikely I I think that given the scale of uh\nFBI investigation it is exceedingly unlikely that it that the the FBI investigation will\nIn fact to yield much new material light on the allegations that had been made\nUm I think that um the strategy of withdrawal\nDifferent uh come to this ... and even more conservative candidate such as um judging Amy Coney Barrett\nOr off the seventh circuit court of pills um would a bit of a actually a politically very very savvy move on the opposite of rubber come um sound of a and a White House um a couple of weeks ago um but given where we are today and given a a political hey\nThat was a a ... both policies of al ...

about it uh yeah everyone's phone crazy\nYou know it act crazy and we were in a meeting\nAnd and every once in a meeting at one time yeah and I'm at one Eighteen and the majority of the people in the room did not know that this was happening and then when they saw it was like what and solve\nPresident alert and and I'm going on Facebook and hearing the same thing so fear\nAnd I'm missing trust you know the whole thing about trust is when this was about I now wonder alright am I going to start getting messages in the middle of the night because somebody out there has decided to just send some sort of crazy message was opening a\nSweet that two AM we might be gained tight we may be wet anthrax messages at two AM and it may be fake news I mean who knows what kind of news is news so it it sounds so far fetched and there are those who go oh well I don't even have that conversation but it's so real well it's so\nHere exactly where it rolls and when you think about so for immigrants who are either here unlawfully without permission or they have a break status you know in terms of temporary status or or they're they're here and and awaiting the the processing of there\nIt it can be pretty you know complicated\nSo many of our population don't want to be in the eye of the government there that level of fear and distress that you speak up\nAnd then you know the ducks the position of that fear and reconciling that with the fact that they all are likely to have us you know some kind of smart phone and they would have gotten these texts and how\nVulnerable than the other person in that situation might feel in terms of big brother watching or our own I'm no longer being tracked I'm no longer not under the radar right and I I Am now being tracked as you said\nI think for me like the only thing honestly that's getting me through these days is like humor rate and just kind of all the the heat like using laughter as a way of dealing with like\nCrap can I say crap I don't know\nWhat we are like literally being laughed at by the entire world I mean after the attacks Leno or after that alert went out all I see on line or or different versions of what President Trump might actually sat in a you know and I just came back from three weeks in Southeast Asia\nAnd usually I can get by with pretending I'm a local but I went with my husband was white and so everybody kind of where we're from and just like the response that we got from people in third world countries\nLook I Am of like ooh [noise] sorry yeah it was it was American because we had Trump I mean they went out to liberate league about Trump okay you know and so it's like we are really right now being laughed at by the entire world and when it was\nJust a just just to be clear the federal emergency management agency has which word is that this particular and it was just a toast with this particular way of communicating is only to be using ... remember\nRight so that when it when I was told everybody that I'm ... and ... yeah but\nBut that was the difference is that that was still regional so I mean it's not like we haven't had these words but they're usually done regionally\nAh this particular system was created under your bottom this Russian ... so it was set up prior yes which is which is probably true how [laughter]\nAnd then having to come out the way it has with this administration tends to mean something totally different\nAnd that's the point because this particular administration has made everything very sensitive and that and was skeptical of everything I mean it really is it getting to be that ludicrous speaking of which I was talking about women that no no\nPlease let's go I mean I don't want to Jack about let's take note at their at three in the room and he'll men's number elliptical but no I don't you gentleman had\nSaid some some really interesting things early on that I'd like to hear some of that but this past week has read several weeks yeah ... yeah you're absolutely right um so whatever we can say about that in well in our nation of women has just been it's it's it feels\nLike and I get I'm looking at this as a man but it feels like this has been a challenging time\nLike times a hundred or so for women ... ah every body literally was watching the Capitol yeah it was riveting and very emotional and I felt personally watching this just saying\nThis is our country and this is the culture war you can call it part as shouldn't chip you can call it\nKind of All right now in that little rectangle we call the television and it also\nTo me it indicated that we really do have voices we are being put in positions oftentimes feel like we don't but we do and we must remember that when those women were at that elevator it made a different you're referring to\nWin the women are confronted a senators are likely ... owner yes and the way you do that you know but it does when I was like a job and a half a state that we just got to remind guy [laughter]\nBut that was remarkable just that the ... and you know thank goodness there was a camera there but just that these women cornered you literally Jeff Flake on the elevator you might get Geoffrey ... is not running for office again these these she'll be replaced is a a you know in a month but\nHis vote matters yeah these women went to him and basically said one of them said look at me look at me and my yell and tell me why you're a you know voting for cabinet and and if you looked at flake right after that when he came down to the Judiciary Committee look like you know he was shaking he was chicken ... which\nI a hell [laughter] okay so as a woman\nThat's where a ... not to interrupt you but that's a a moment where in a sea of seeing women disrespected such as we said a senator robust yeah disrespect like half an hour and I do when\nPaid off right there in that moment right here that got in that moment and I think my ... my my response to the the whole cabinet thing was I felt betrayed\nBy the country I felt\nI felt like all the stuff we're taught when we were little and school about equality and you said your body is safe and all that kind of stuff was just crap they were feeding us\nWell it didn't believe that I mean the than than the messages that I've been getting from white males who are saying now that they're the victims they're the ones that need to be need to watch out for themselves and each other and that\nThey're under attack it it amazes me it it just it boggles my mind that out of all of this that's what people are getting out of it it amazes me that\nThe uh the strong among white women who still believe that cabinet is\nEligible for this position and even seen that grouping is nothing boys will be boys more is the woman's fault for the way she dresses she confuses the boys in school you know what's\nBeen phenomenal is to see the various movements sense actually November twenty sixteen in terms of the women's march and me too movement and and different iterations than we know and and the movement for black lives\nThe principal leader there are black women right ah\nAnd for me the the the take away their is when women step up we are really powerful but it's the when we step off part of it which historically a\nOur voices had been stifled um in terms of who who has allowed us are not allowed us to speak and and we saw that in the Kavanaugh hearings and and count on trying to clash center called Columbus our voice\nWho by the way is to be commended ... grounds you she could've ... you know she could've when Kavanaugh basically said so called before I was asking him essentially had he never had a blackout and then his response was blacked out which is ...\nNumber directions but she stayed very calm and just you know if they have to live in his cabinet that I was wearing ... and go there and they can scream and be angry and cry and everything and they're just being tough but if if women were being emotional\nBut like that but if if if they're in a Williams right yes but if I had acted like Kavanaugh mhm and when it gets a job I think it would have been a different I think for me it's not and\nYou know those hearing the past two weeks you know that we've mentioned have been absolutely incredible in this country and to watch for the Kavanaugh hearings they become teachable moments that I can use in the classroom\nTo silence many voices women\nPeople of color immigrants there seems to be the ... you know I'm doing everything Obama put in place\nThere seems to be the bars that scene that's real [noise] is concentrated effort you know a highlighted what the two weeks of the the whole cabinet herons and I think I totally agree that voting is one way that that we can change that\nYeah I Am still in outer amazement that this discussion is going on there that were still questioning a large chunks of this country's questioning or ... of women\nAnd I mean you just it it just blows me away would there be uh me too movement if if if we were right now talking about president Hillary Clinton\nInteresting I just wanted to point out that you know that the whole time you were saying that you had shut lose down\nI ... I I was mentioning I was like okay you talk about women in parliament in class you know you try to make a statement about\nAre and and also I think part of a as I say and and see and part of that is I remember when we first started kind of stories and Chris encouraged us to kind of jump in and so it's not a cost me trying to cut you out there is just trying to just be energetic and be\nPart of the ... so much so much to that because there's that element of you like questioning herring which they tend to say but at the same time when we did start doing these jealous you wouldn't jump in because you as a Native American you didn't see as respectful and so it's like oh I'm Glad he's standing his\nGround in jeopardy but at the same time he's kind of putting lived on ... says you do realize we're are numbered\nI understand that I'm at but I'm just saying so my my finger ... wasn't ...\nCause she lose but if that's how it's being proceed while and then I then I Apologize because that was a mind in a life of exactly going and what we've been talking about so I Apologize to ... ... in my tent wasn't squash you was\nTo be interactive and interject of to keep the conversation going I think the important thing is is like you know you're the one that's so hard oh my gosh [laughter] I think that's the\nIs like where we when you are willing to accept that was my bed you know and just say my bad\nYou know that changes things instead of a sticking so firmly to our guns that you cannot ... that's what happens bad marriages and you know I mean and and and\nThen you get to a point where you just ignore each other and you pretend everything's fine and it would take you back to my original question is would we be in this moment right now for you can obviously Hillary would not have nominated\nA Brett Kavanaugh ... we have uh me too movement if we had\nPresident Hillary on it and I think we land\nThe more empowering for the women stepping forward\nWith the me too movement to know that that our our chief executive is a woman yeah I agree with you because the start of the me too movement goes back to Harvey Weinstein\nAnd then the more that they looked into it you know get our ... story with a surface and I I I completely agree with you believe that it having a woman in that\nUh executive roll mhm would allow that and then there's that awkwardness of hey you know what happened in her marriage right um and and how that might influence the dynamics of it as well ... what are you thinking and and\nWhole lot [laughter] a whole lot I think um yeah probably but I think it would have come out different ... um I Believe um what really helped to ignite this movement was um\nThe man who's you know running this country now when we learned about his own behaviors and when those behaviors continue to surface and then the next thing you knew you were hearing about people in various political positions or very key positions and then that\nI don't know that all of that would have happened as openly but it made women I think get very angry and frustrated\nAnd that's what all of this has been about I mean it it does after a while you just as ... as you get sick and tired of being sick and tired and that's what happens something has to bring this thing to a head and I believe um\nWhat we've experienced over these past ...\nAlmost two years I guess oh my goodness well it's been a it's been a trip hasn't it\nIt's will serve is because um earlier I was hearing white men\nOn um NPR NPR talk about I'm feeling that they were victims and that is not fair the way the system is\nTurning on them and why is it that they are being picked on and in in in abuse in this manner so if they're not getting it and and yet they're being a fuel purposely [noise]\nUm and I do believe it is all by design which is sad and that's where we really have to understand what's happening because if we\nDon't pay real attention to that the next thing you know which is the direction that I think some people want it to go um we really will be in in more of a civil war right\nHere I'm a dog whistles are becoming more than ... free yeah for most like their dog whistles that are coming out that I've never heard yeah I like this one really all of a sudden\nFolks are like you know we're not folks but there there is a concerted effort you put out into the media will think about your son wait a minute about the woman who ... who was right or nearly got raped and he's carrying this around with her for life that's right so\nFact that that folks are saying sexual assault by a man and a woman somehow threatens you threaten to your\nPower you're standing as a white man is that really what this is a pilot and and it it is a dog whistle absolutely a because we know not\nAll white men are sexual assault predators right um and we know that a salt happens by you know men of of\nAnd ethnicity I think that's the\nFear and well from what I'm hearing from from white guys as like anyone can accuse me of something I didn't do and their fear is that right now we believe the accuser ... and\nMy only response that is will do for just don't do anything that you know and secondly you know if it's a false claim it's going to come on it's a false commit always ... you know how it comes out that's false claim so just like\nJust don't do stupid things\nWell and and then and then there's also speaks or drinking or Miller suggested\nYou know you can't use alcoholism excuse but ... you know it certainly doesn't help if you're serving king and bring it on\nYou know something bad happened right at all so where's the adults in her situation again especially when you've got a pretty prestigious school in DC you know but either but what about when the adults are like it's no big deal well he said every beer was flowing little short he he grabbed her but\nNo big deal he you know he he's just he likes you like me you know we heard that as girls right like oh he's picking on you because he likes you and that's it like ... nothing is being done about it I mean this is it's I'm was ingrained into us it's our fault\nRight we couldn't wish the Getty strapped tank tops in high school because it distracted the boys and I'm like well then get a see in the school\nAnd what comes to mind is the lack of civility\nUm that under line this entire part of this right it's a lack of civility and and the fact that\nThere's a growing acceptance of the lack of ... you know it used to be that no you don't behave that way and the you know the\nSupport for

R. go dot com\nBut I Want to point out that NATO is also operating in Afghanistan in Kosovo and in the Mediterranean these are these things have nothing to do with Europe that says I don't know if you would call this mission creep or what else but\nCore I Want you to take on that aspect of NATO's being fit for purpose what is its purpose if it's not a limited to the security of Europe\nSaid the one thing all of those military operations you name have in common is that it was the United states who dragged our European allies into participating in them\nSo one reason that NATO is set for a purpose because it is the way we organize the most capable countries most willing to help us\nDo what we want to do in the world and I would just remind people that the only time that NATO's mutual defense pledge what's called in was after September eleventh in defense of us\nA John Mearsheimer picked as long as you just want to make two points one is that when you talk about NATO from a favorable point of view it's all part of a story where the United states has a responsibility to keep peace in virtually every area of the world\nAnd for the war it's important to have these European allies because they can help us in all these crazy escapades that we engage in where we get our nose bloody\n'cause it\nWere really wonderful in helping us destabilize Libya and create all sorts of problems not only in Libya with but with regard to refugees inside of your furthermore NATO expansion which is all designed just to keep NATO will live has failed miserably\nEastern Europe than ever when we should be either pivot to Asia where spending the money here in the United states on the question\nTo the pivot to Asia real well John Mearsheimer was saying we have limited resources and there are more dangerous places that we should be voting to end paying attention to for example China we can't do both what about that well\nOne I think we can do both we historically have done both wherever we choose to bear the burden is a different issue I think you can check the Chinese but it's going to be a risky process we're going to have to stand firm on Taiwan\nBut it does but to the point of NATO you're saying that in no way would you say that the need to do some deal with either cancels\nOut I mean again we're not talking I if you add all this money off is comparatively to what we spend on domestic affairs it's being us Steven\nCalling um royal set in his opening statement that it's tempting fate to pull out of Europe meaning I think what are you saying fate actually is is Russia um take that on\nWhat we've got to do that when we get to the Russia flat and I don't think there's any but I'd like to coral little with what I read in the paper every day that NATO is quote the greatest military alliance in the history of the world you know ... that's right\nWell first of all NATO hasn't fought a war is an alliance yet so we're really not sure about that Second Life when NATO does fight wars it's a handful of willing partners with the United states the coalition of\nThe willing but look at the wars John mentioned them what are we going Serbia ended up to be a disaster everybody in this room not just those with liberal illusions would agree Iraq is a disaster where's this greatest military alliance in the world\nWhere is the security it's brought\nHaving friends to fight alongside you doesn't add guarantee that you're going to fight the right words are have the right strategy ... it means you don't have to do it all by yourself and sell the\nIt is it's going to be a lot easier to manage a rising China is as this now already happening Britain and France are helping us police freedom of navigation the Japanese are helping ... that that that are helping us that it seems to me like clear is that we would have\nMore wars if you didn't have the NATO alliance to rural Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries out of [noise] I'm\nActually sort of astonished and I'm proud I mean the Europeans have lasted as long as they have in Afghanistan\nA given credit I Would not have gotten out that way in two thousand\nI mean let's let's be Frank I mean the the welfare states and Europe have in ... in the military in Europe uh that day were able actually to come out as a ploy the forces they did I think it's quite commendable I Wish they'd stayed longer I Wish they would spend more money but I Would just repeat a little story that was told me by the British\nDeputy commander of ice that when I was in Afghanistan one time and I asked him about the barriers European contributions and he said you know the French commander comes to me once every two weeks and he says the thing that makes the American and the British commanders hearts just start to ... batter and that is ... do you want to keep [noise]\n... that is a sign of a good hour John ... [laughter] I I just want to pick\nMilitaries are feeble militaries these are tiny militaries and the reason they want us to be in Europe to protect them is so that they don't have to pay money for defense and uncles soccer pay the money to protect them\nAnd the idea that the Europeans are going to help us contain China is not a serious argument these countries have no power projection capability if we weren't in Europe protecting them they'd have to spend more money\nAsia and we'd be free to fix the New York subways [laughter]\nI'll check that dress [laughter]\nWe are certainly in Europe to help protect your but the Europeans are partners as we project our power in the world that we can have a debate of the right or wrong way to protect us power and whether the right decisions have been made but the U.S has never gotten into a fight because the NATO allies have dragged us into that fight when you go to Europe when you go to the Baltics\nWhen you go throughout Western Europe France Germany you you hear this this demand for the United states I mean think of the drama we had over the summer when President Trump went to the NATO summit and talked about\nWhether or not the U.S would stay in the alliance and there's panic throughout the European ... they're worried that the United United States is going to go away that us leadership is going to be diminished I think it was a reason for that they're asking for us\nThey want us to be there with them and that's a very very unique position for a country to be in Russia and China do not have those kinds of problems\nAnd this is this is an asset for us that we can squander with the wrong decisions and the wrong kind of leadership and that includes\nDiscussion of the revolution [noise]\n\nWe're moving out to our next resolution it deals with Russia yes Russia makes trouble for the U.S are disappearing in elections meddling in the middle east but just how potentially dangerous is Moscow to the U.S really it has nukes but\nAn unimpressive economy it has ... ... but a plethora of domestic problems might we'd be over worrying the Russia factor or are we not worried enough let's find out our resolution for this round the Russia threat\nIs overblown making the opening statements in regard to this question Steven calling on the resolution the Russian threat is overblown do you declare yes or no\nAnd you could write a book about it and in fact I just huh\n[noise]\nLet me let me just wrap it up and I don't even ...\nWho's Russia's represents absolutely no threat to the United states except those threats we ourselves that provoked\nThrough NATO which expansion putting himself contrary to the newspapers has not been mainly and aggressive leader you would think that's his middle name but a reactive later Russia's today like it or not\nIs again a very great world power certainly militarily and diplomatic\nHere in lives the tragedy and all this all stop prudence rush\nAnyone's rushing it should be America's number one national security partner in the world Washington's squander that opportunity after Nineteen Ninety One and it's continued to squander it today by inventing are provoking threats\nResigning in Russia which do not exist\nBecause they've been going [noise]\nOn the resolution of Russia threat is overblown Corey shocking to declare yes or no I agree that\nThe rest of the threat is overblown but not a because the Russians pose no threat to us our desire to pose a threat to us\nAt the invasion of Ukraine the invasion of Crimea the invasion of Georgia their military exercises that they are holding simulating nuclear weapons you send the Baltic states a\nQuiet rush it as a state appears to want is other countries to fail and that will make it feel safe that's why I think Russia is a threat to us they want to be seen that way right John McCain a always used to say that Russia wasn't didn't have an ...\nFor security and now you Ron I'm always high on the list of us security concerns and aspiring a nuclear power the backer of terrorism with the perpetual question isolate Iran squeeze it or tried to coax this radical nation and to more moderate behavior\nIt's the choice that's at the heart of our final resolution it is time to take a hard line on Iran Derek she'll lay on that resolution it's time to take a hard line on Iran you declare yes or no\nI mean yes but I Am a yes but you know explain um Iran provides\nMaterial and political support to those who are trying to destabilize the middle east Iran's forces have been responsible for the deaths of thousands in places like Syria runs proxies had killed American civilians and our troops and Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons\nSo of course it's time to take a hard line against Iran or that begins by forging the strongest possible international consensus Iran must know that its actions have consequences whether in form of economic pressure political isolation or even military response\nIn other words the best way to take a hard line is to present a United front\nAnd that's what the Iran nuclear deal did\nThe Iran nuclear deal did not solve all of our problems in with her on but it did put the brakes the number is urging serious ones so taking a hard line needs to be more than a slogan needs to be a means to an end it's not just about talking tough and beating your chest it's about pursuing smart policies that you get you closer to your goals thank you ...\n[noise] the resolution of\nHard line on Iran Steven Cohen on this resolution to declare yes or no\nYou know you know Derrick I I mean I I I kind of giving the credit that he's made it released a semi persuasive case I mean I don't think it's all the charge like some of the things that have been set\nOh sure sure for sure but my feeling is is that the United states or Trump as we like to call the United states today having left the nuclear agreement and reimpose sanctions\nI asked myself what would a harder line result it's likely to create instability inside Iran\nThat is likely to spread to Iraq and Syria and elsewhere in the middle east and I don't see that is good for anybody\nCertainly it certainly would at least theoretically risk war depending on how hard this hard liners and that could involve the United states Israel and possibly Russia it will then increase Russia's military and energy producing role in the world because\nThey've been going on sorry under time is up thank you very much\n[noise]\nGoing up the courage shockey on the resolution it's time to take a hard line on Iran please tell us how you declare\nIs time to take a harder line on Iran they are that top state sponsor of terrorism in the world they're arming\nHezbollah and Hamas they are keeping bus Bashar al Assad I'm In power at and they are occasionally interdict thing shipping and the straits of Hormuz through which an enormous amount of the world's oil transits\nUh so so yes we should take a harder line both\nThe Trump Administration and the Obama administration had an unbelievable policy namely either you stop to nuclear weapons program or we will destroy it and\nI don't think that's credible out if either of the two governments we need a wider range of tools a to manage the around problem at the ... addicts core the Iran problem is that\nThat domestic legitimacy and the foreign policy of Iran have the same room which is they view that themselves\nTaking a soft line on Iran doesn't result in Iran stopping doing these things that could very shocking [noise]\nIt's fun to take a hard line\nOn Iran John Mearsheimer do declare yes or no\nI say no I take this resolution is a question uh dealing with President Trump's decision in May of this year to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran and uh I think that that was a fundamental mistake but\nThe question is [noise] question you want to ask yourself is what countries want nuclear weapons they want nuclear weapons because they understand they are the ultimate deterrent\nAnd if you're threatened you really want to have nuclear weapons why does Israel has nuclear weapons because it's leaders think they live in a dangerous neighborhood where they want to have the ultimate deterrent and they're back pocket\nWhat was good for the goose is good for the gander so there's going to be a very powerful incentive for the Iranians to think the same way\nNow but hawks believe you can get really tough with the Iranians and you can beat them in to giving up nuclear weapons for ever I don't think that's going to happen\nFirst of all it's just going to reinforce the hard liners inside of Iran and second of all nationalism is a very powerful force and the idea that you could push the Iranians around I think is a misguided thought\nThank you [noise]\nHave a hard line on\nIran left in the lineup of panelists to declare yes or no royal mark ... are you a yes or no\nUh I say I mean this is one of those issues that I think the drop administration was actually on the right thing I have to commend it at a stop the surreal situation where the United states was\nFeeding tens of billions of dollars into the Islamic republic into itchy eyes are very ... throughout the region for a short rest\nIt makes no strategic or moral sense\nWhy we would want to give money to a regime that has gauge the mass\nSlaughter in Syria why we would want to give money to a stage that is building his laws throughout the a Shiite regions of the middle east\nI just think this is not particularly since the J it'd be a way was such a very very bad deal it's as leaky it's got as many holes in Swiss cheese in it I Would also add\nThe demonstrations that have been going on in Iran since December ought to tell you they're not shouting out down with America Don with Donald Trump shyly down with the regime down with the revolutionary guard\n\nThe resolution it's time to\nTake a hard line on Iran looking at\nThe opening round we have three I says and who knows I Want to go to Corey shockey with some points made by people on the no side which seemed to all come down to the question of dangerous unintended consequences of taking a harder line on Iran and the one hand Steven Cohen saying you would risk war dangerous unintended consequences what about that\nAnd yes I think there are dangerous unintended consequences for confronting Iran destabilizing and dangerous behavior but they're also dangerous unintended consequences of not confronting\nAllowing Iran to continue to destabilize regional governments to interject that free commerce through the strength to farm is to continue to be a state sponsor of terror recall that the Iranian government tried to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington DC\nSo not confronting saying bad restaurant yeah also also has the potential to encourage incentivize continued Iranian malign behavior\nActually well look this is the land to no good option\n... of the Iran nuclear deal I had nothing to do with the negotiations uh with the Pentagon's role and this was what do we do when the negotiations negotiations fail and all we're left with is the military option\nNow we have options yeah US military has has has shown over the years that it can do all sorts of things overthrown governments put a lot of uh firepower on particular targets but\nThose those are not particularly palatable options so I Would argue we were in a better position where we had isolated the nuclear problem\nRoles right temporarily ten to Fifteen Years so we could work on the other aspects of Iran's behavior that pose such a threat to the United states the problem now that we pulled out of the nuclear deal when you go to Europe when you got that the middle east what they're talking about is American policy not Iran's policy\nAnd I don't believe that Iran has actually benefited that much from the uh the nuclear deal I mean you're on and people were on the streets and they actually thought the nuclear deal was a bad deal for them\nSo the idea that now we're going to engage in some sort of negotiation to get a better deal from from our perspective we're still for Iran to me is fantasy John ... yeah I\nI Want to respond to a point the Korean made and tied in to a point to roommate you're critical of the Iranians for destabilizing regimes in the region is there any country that's destabilized more regimes than the United states\nOf America\nRespects funny\nI Want to bring the topic back to the focus back to Iran at the moment and go and you know I I understand but I Want to bring another dimension that we haven't discussed yet which is this notion that's been out there since the Islamic republic came to be\nThat there's a there's a moderate element there's a there's a there's a there's a group there to go to although to you first car shockey it do you believe there is a moderate elements of play to to engage with taking a hard line\nWork two and a half that or what\nSaturday partly cloudy with a high and you're fifty Sunday there was a thirty percent chance for showers with a high up fifty five\nNPR News is a

there what did they tell you was the main reason that they march what brought them out\nWell the people I spoke to said that they oppose the president's personal demeanor as well as his policies and many of them just said that they felt like it was time for more people to speak out or if they are when there's people who are against what the president is talking about\nA Emily Smith of Rochester she kind of summed up put a lot of people told me I'm Emily brought her seven year old son to the rally she said she really disagrees with the Trump administration's policy of detaining children at

people were demonstrating\nBut he didn't say that he agreed with their message so when I asked him if you support the president he just said no comment\nBut then of course I came across a William Hanson and he was sitting in the passenger seat of a pickup truck at a gas station along the on the march wrote\nAnd I asked him what he thought Hansen didn't necessarily have any comments on the protesters you just said he's going to he's going to the rally and he wants to hear the president has to say\nAnd then Hansen told me that he just he's a fan of the president's economic agenda he said

Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I uh eventually did reach them by phone from the did than told me what exactly to do first in the field sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former run this had been pre filled by the uh presumably the age when I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand the characters bases of bailout\nSo you filled out this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nI did not I was never called book I read by my food by my computer ah hoping to get me\nClear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think once you live in front of the so usually a committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black and yeah I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the black neon phrase means doing things that you don't know you you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to that condition how can one oh\nLet me let me ask you this is a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to a what I Know about making eighty three maybe four to eighty five at college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense at all\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now on us\nDiversity and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News ...\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created that a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this Hi Curtis hey are what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more well\nMy favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nA lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out\nIn certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at the health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels\nAnd then there's this category called professional and business services there were like high end services things like designed accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish\nIn the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set it makes them better at their jobs\nAnd it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's Cardiff Garcia co
