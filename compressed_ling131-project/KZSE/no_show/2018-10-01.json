Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven war\nI think probably two state is more likely but you know what if they do a single if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy if they're both happy I'm okay with either I think the two state is more likely\nIt is not clear of the two sides were gifts to a second strict the Trump Administration has yet\nPressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less some Palestinians have been shifting focus Palestinian analysts ... told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care if the state that represents them as Israel or Palestine or has some other science fiction name these are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity prosperity which they fulfill themselves as individuals or groups\nIn every possible way that any American or British press that our Chinese person would walk\nPalestinians today have trouble going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces\nThe demand for equal rights is provocative eat implies that is Palestinians are denied a state millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter different like he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of the two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\nLook I think people mean different things when they say two states rather than get into the label I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential agreement as the Palestinians should be able to have all the powers to govern themselves\nBut none of the power to threaten us to keep power that must not be in their hands\nIs the question of security in the tiny area was to the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about the width\nOf about fifty sixty kilometers mhm we're\nBoth Palestinians and Israelis Lou Israel must return to the overriding security responsibility otherwise we'll get what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left and the basically the militant Islam came in under ... by law observing through on or under her mouth\nAnd or do we do if you have a state that has a most of the southern part of the states but not the ... security is that if they are not a state I don't know you can argue about that that aren't my position a bit of a very very clear both to the previous administration under the Trump\nAnd well let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago when a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that they're two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in an independent state or Israel is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says\nNow you're not willing to put the state's labeled the independent state label or give them full independence\nWhat about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them full civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject but I think there's it's not an either or model I think we have a third model very leave\nWhich is basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones who security look in the middle east which was littered with failed states that's often the best you can do to try to do something else you know you get a guy\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about a situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leaves the question are you willing to support that proposal that would give Palestinians equal\nRights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israelis citizen and what form would that take\nWell they would have those rights and their own territory in other words\nHave their own flag they have their own\nWell they have any of them now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah engineering or not loose are governed by the Palestinian but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would ah endanger Israel\nNow this is a very hard to think where the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east and reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best image what we could we could have a lot and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have the overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question\nHow come you don't see that much terrorism in a in the west bank\nWell first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good um\nWho don't have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by us but here's how it's done we have say intelligence about terrorists in a one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the\nPalestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it because I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the risk\nWithin attack as we weren't yesterday the un\nBy President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also

remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer service\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met some people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the

I'm not engaged that person is strategic planning because they were too emotional and that um and it was a person of color that was being referred to end it like it was like an a ha like that's what

it was tough and so I finally got to a place where I'm like I have got to be whole wherever I Am However I'm showing up like I'm showing up at me um and it had been interesting to see how much um\nHow much that has meant to other people around to feel like they then can bring that up because I realized that by holding myself that\nI wasn't I'm allowing others um around me as a leader to be me there ... because I thought this is the way you need to show up and I thought to myself that when I stopped I could be a much better leader\nSomeone else had an experience like with that [noise] sure we have a trend of diversity inclusion going on right now and I said trend because I've been an educator for about Twenty years now and trends come and go as um\nOur demographics students um they emerge right to become something new they are they're scaffolding on what their previous people weren't right so diverse and inclusion and I think it is a work in progress and I see that because as much as we like to believe that we accept everyone's belonging is\nEveryone's inclusion that's not happening as a brown woman I'm more frequently feel like my friend here where I Need to bring myself back\nAnd be less authentic to a conversation and I intentionally we're talking about exhaustion here I intentionally choose my words very carefully because I like being employed I really do um parenting people paying tuition I get that\nSo that less of authenticity them is that a word I don't know I just make it up academics [laughter] take note that yeah that that is a truth that I function with every single day\nThe reality is a lot of people can't do that because of power differential right I mean it goes back to the history of slavery and the construction of gender identity for women of color\nAnd the dictionary but vulnerability also means white woman so I'm very these restrictions Melissa Harris Perry and sister citizen has an essay called the cricket room where she argues that most women of color or cricket and if we try to stand up the rest of the world\nPushes us back down so I'm happy that you're able to do it I don't want to be Debbie Downer but just looking at the statistics of what we were talking about\nFor example black girls brown and black girls in schools or more likely to be expelled\nMore likely to receive punitive um punishments um because their behaviors perceived differently so although we say that we want black women to have the freedom and to show up\nOur full cells we live in a society that doesn't allow us to do that because we don't have access to power seen that one of the things we were talking about was what is an ally\nActually look like right yes can you can you define it in your mind and then maybe we get some definitions from people on the audience how to use the allies ship\nFirst of all one of the things that happens with allies ship is that you don't get to call yourself an ally\nSo that's a that's a very important distinction about what it means to be an ally you can't just say I'm an ally to women of color if you're not actually doing stuff to help women of color if you're not engaging with women of color and if people were to ask\nWomen of color if you are in fact an ally and they said not really and then you're not an ally so in al I mean someone who is willing to stand in their own privilege and use that\nFor the betterment of women of color people who are disabled people you know just people that are different from them\nAble to stand in that space and occupy it even in occupy your white miss ... and I have to say as a white\nWoman what do I want to be able to say about myself oh I'm an ally I'm a feminist\nThis is what being a feminist means but scene and I have hashed this out a lot it means more than just declaration\nRight what do you think Stacey\n[laughter] I Would agree [laughter]\nUm I think that being an ally can show up in many different ways and I think one of the biggest thing that we can do as allies is to localized are um be against what we hear in our own communities um when you're sitting and you're like oh that's just our ... our raises uncle\nWell no [laughter] I mean he might be that but also put them in his place you know so it's about like\nYour community and where you stand and what you're willing to sacrifice of people have those arguments have those

layers we just see the surface level acting out and and can't realize that you know their parents\nAre have faced so\nMuch more diversity than we can even imagine as white people and I'm In ways that we can imagine\nI'm Carrie Miller was seen Hodges and you're listening to an NPR News forum\nAh talking about on this day that we had a day long experience of testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee of Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Blasey Ford we are talking about how to be allies to one another in the midst of the me too movement [noise]\nAnd uh it's a candid conversation\nI always wanted to ask you something about this you know because\nOne of the things you and I have talked about is the willingness to be vulnerable and willing to say I don't know I heard that between these two friends back here I think that's a really tall order I think it's hard to say\nInvisible labor right it it's heavy lifting so then if it becomes the job of the person who's the most vulnerable within the paradigm to do the work of educating the dominant identity then that's only creating more danger for the marginalized body\nThat too is a that is a power system you quoted Dr ...\nAnd then she had to have a Ted Talk titled the urgency of into sexuality and you're talking about the disparity in schools Minnesota has one of the largest disparities of the nation around race so I Want to say to you that this blindness\nThis is a ... this is a state of emergency we're talking about the life expectancy of black women and all categories we're talking about the future of our kids and their ability to survive but yet at the same time we're asking\nPeople of color then to do the work of educating you on how to fix it that only works to perpetuate I'm not saying I have the answer but I think you bring up a great point Kerry that's too much of a tall order that works to re inscribed marginalized position\nAnd you know tie you said something earlier a great question that I don't want us to mess which was do white women want to to truly be allies and I think that is the question of today\nI Do I Want to have the opportunity tend not to be out you likely exactly and that can opt out of that work right it's a question it is a good one\nAnd I think one of the things that's helped me to say what does this look like for me to choose is it an option or not\nSomeone once said I don't know if being in LA is enough I think I Need you to be an accomplice yes [noise] and that was helpful and he and he said you know cause an accomplice if if someone were to suggest we were committing a crime you're coming to jail with me [laughter] and you're not saying sorry that happened to you\nYou say can we opt out I go back to an article in the Washington Post in January of this year by professor writing about Thomas Jefferson's mixed race daughter from him raping Sally Hemings her first line this is a woman white woman an essay\nAnd I'm paraphrasing we all know that Thomas Jefferson had a long standing relationship with Sally Hemings\nThat's where you up that's where the white woman opted out it wasn't a long standing relationship he was raping her so I think you asked\nBaby white women have been complicit since the Eighteenth century and we have to first go back and see where we had been complicit fix it and then figure out how to move forward that's a pivotal point and I would argue it's still happening\nToday at and how we look at structures Anita Hill versus Dr Ford today\nYou know see not in some ways I think the answer could be I can kind of opt out on this by doing them minimum or telling myself\nI'm doing what I mean this is the argument going on within the me too movement among feminists right kind of broke out at the women's march I could just be doing my thing and feeling good about what I'm doing and miss and all this other stuff\nYes you can totally do that right but it doesn't help all of us right\nBut but I guess I guess the question is are you\nWhere do you feel OK sitting in your privilege yeah knowing that you have it that was an annoying one but he got it knowing that if you use it you could positively affect change\nWhat does that feel like I don't know that feeling I Can't articulate what that must be like but that's the that's the truth of the situation you're sitting on privilege that you have and you have the opportunity to use your powers for good or use your powers for evil\nBut why are you assuming that white women are safe that's the thing the faulty assumption from the conversation to begin with\nI Would argue my wife sisters have always been endanger you just didn't know acknowledge it 'cause my Sally Hemings was being raped what was happening to Thomas Jefferson's wife right while she was still alive how he treated her I'm going to take this\nI'm not sure that I'm going to say there's a eloquently but I Would like to ask of the other way\nOther people to decide whether or not I am but to the other white women in the room how has someone how long have you talked to someone else to be empathetic for people of color or how has someone taught you that because to me the first step to being an ally as someone who grew up with no racial diversity in my home town [noise]\nI don't even know where to start and while I Want to be an ally I I feel unsafe asking how to be an ally\nHere's an answer I don't know about that [laughter]\nI a couple of years ago maybe made was kind of early in my journey of as as you just described coming from a place of not having a lot of diversity around me and just sort of ... in visibly unaware of my privilege a and I made a comment\nAnd there was a reaction and I was like okay I did something wrong there I'm not entirely sure what it was an after the flood former whatever happened\nA colleague who I'd worked with for several years but it wasn't like we're buddies or anything\nWho was a black woman was was I don't I don't even know what the additive is she was willing to do that emotional work of coming over to me and saying hey let me just this is why you got the reaction that you did and that was that was a life changing moment in terms of my like\nMeeting that and and learning to understand what it meant for her to be willing to take that moment and for her to be willing to know that I was going to have an emotional reaction and be willing to put up with that because she knew that I meant to do better and then I just needed help getting their\nUh and I don't know what that I I tend to try to think of ally yang I guess like a kind of make it into a verb for myself like okay how can I Try to be an ally in this moment or how can I can I can I act out to LA ships in this moment as opposed to\nThere's so many ways that I Am not there\nExcept that that sounds to me like the emotional labor I was gonna say it has it's you're very lucky that you had a an individual that was willing to sit with you and do that and package that for you I think what happens is that oftentimes there's a frequency that comes with that\nThat makes it laborious for women of color and it's it is too hard it's too hard can I\nCan I respond to the question of the white women that she asked about what what we need to do start yeah it's we have to start with ourselves though so um I I've read some scholarship lately about this idea of European American women need having this ... this need in our culture to\nPerform happiness and that that's what keeps the patriarchy feeling okay with us we use terms vulnerability and that and white women have\nI'm Carrie Miller and you're listening to live coverage of President Trump and the rose garden at the White House he made a statement about the new trade deal with Canada and Mexico and now he is taking some questions also promising to take some questions about his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThis is a deal I'm not touted this is good for all three that's good and just that fact makes a good for us but this is good for all three but this is a much different deal the NAFTA and this is much more of a reciprocal deal for the United states which is really good yeah go ahead Peter\n[noise]\nKnow why don't why don't you just uh well do the capital questions I mean\nYou're talking about being treated harshly will do that in a couple of let's finish up trade 'cause you have a lot of people that want to run over to the wall Street Journal and start writing go ahead please Mexican during those I Can't hear you a Mexican journalist go ahead if\nYou're a it's so you're going to keep the tariffs on steel another medium to Mexico and Canada until such time\nWe can do something that would be a different like quotas perhaps so that our industry has protected we are not going to allow or steel industry\nTo disappear it was almost gone I'll tell you what if our country kept going the way it was going within two years you wouldn't have had a steel industry we have to have a steel industry we have to have it aluminum you know there are certain industries important so we are working on that now\nThat wasn't part of this but we will do something and in fact Bob if you want you may want to say a couple of words about that because we're literally talking about that one hour ago\nGreat thank you Mr President I guess that was their first of all they're two separate things as far as we're concerned we know that there are great interest in both countries we are engaged you can talk now with an effort to try to preserve the the effect of our program\nProgramming is supported by near up a new kind of precision pain clinic that pinpoints paying at the source dialing down the need for opioids while dialing up the patients long term health and wellbeing nearer clinics dot com\nAre really good a yes or go ahead please\nI Am Mr President just hoping you can just reiterate on the terrorists what specifically would it take for Canada or Mexico to be exempt from these terrorists and secondly did you consider dairy the deal breaker yes she came to the area was a deal breaker\nAnd now for our farmers it's as you know substantially opened up much more and I know they can't open they're completely that farmers also you know they can't be overrun and I fully on and I tell them that I say look I understand you have limits but they could do much better and we've opened it up to our farmers so the\nFolks up in Wisconsin I I tell you what I went to Wisconsin I went to Iowa Joni knows better than anybody right and Scott Walker who I think is a fantastic governor talks about it all the time that\nOur farmers were not treated properly by Canada now they're going to be treated with respect that they're going to be treated fairly or as I say in that reciprocal way going very important yes go ahead\nThanks This president um she was there was some give and take on both sides for this deal I Wonder what's in your view would be your biggest concession to Canada and why you decided to make that concession number two if you could\nDive in a bit more to the do your thoughts on Justin Trudeau you're talking about tensions I Wonder what you throughout this process what you've\nLearned about him and what the state of the relationship is with him today and going forward [noise]\nWell I think my biggest concession would be making the deal because\nCome and want to take from I'm Talking about every country and that gives us a tremendous advantage and negotiating that we never used before with past administration we never use it every day and we have is a loser\nEvery day you could look at almost every country in the world almost every country we have trade deficits we lose with everybody\nSo I think my biggest concession was making the deal\nBecause we could have done it a different way but it would have been nasty I wouldn't have been nice and I don't want to have that we have a great relationship with Canada I think now it'll be better than ever uh all the only problem with Justin is he loves his people and he's you know fighting hard for his people\nI think we you know we've always had actually a very good relationship it get a little got a little bit testy in the last couple of months\nBut that was over this agreement and I understand that but no I think I think are just in a good person who's doing a good job he he felt very committed to his people and that's what he did\nAnd again this is a this is good for everybody this is good for Canada good from Mexico also yes yes please please go ahead\nThank you Mr President as you mentioned you're going to be signing this agreement and your counterparts going to be signed this agreement from the next sixty days then it's up to Congress right you're very confident I get that you're competing not at all confident [laughter] I'm not\nWell known today Congo you think that he told me if you guys get assigned to tell me I think I think they went along versus controlled by Democrats could happen couldn't figure it out and do they want to throw rocks that yeah they might\nWilling to throw one of the great deals for people and the workers they may be willing to do that for political person for you know people are political purposes because frankly uh you know they'll have twenty twenty in mind so far I Dream about twenty twenty when I look at once\nWant to they want to do as well as they can and still trying to reject even great deals like this is a great deal for our country great for other countries but it's a great deal for our country and great for a worker or I can tell you whether or not they will obstruct\nWhether or not they will resist I mean the whole campaign is resist I see the signs all resist they don't even know what they're resisting if you ask them what are you resist say well let me think about that they can ask they had somebody on this weekend they said what are you resisting\nAnd they were unable to answer the question so you know I I Can't tell you about delay obstruct resist because you know right after this election and I think we're going to do\nWell although history is not on our side I guess in history a generally whoever has the White House doesn't do well in midterms but the one difference as we have the greatest economy in the history of our country I think that's a big difference\nAnd that's one of our problems too because people that went out and voted for me and they wouldn't be voting for me if I was on the ticket but I'm not on the ticket but Congress is on the ticket and I try and tell my people that's the same thing as me in a sense that's the same thing think of it as the same thing as me but I think we're going to do uh\nWell I actually I think I mean we have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago when I started looking at it closely I won't mention names but there were senators that we're not in place they were not even and you know exactly what I'm Talking about numerous of them they were not in play\nIn other words let's not go here let's not go to the state four or five states now it's down there like even races in one case they're up\nTwo points now who knows what's happening and you know as you know there are a lot of ... repression polls are posing or aren't very accurate because I see polls that I Know are false having to do a certain of the races but\nWe had areas and we had ...\nSupport for NPR's brought you by the law firm of ... intellectual property group with offices in Minnesota and Los Angeles Inskeep ... group aims to help companies leverage the power of patents to protect their innovation you didn't find out more at ... dot com\nAnd I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news okay\nRight ... yeah it was right behind if you believe that the trade agreement will be a major issue in the mid term elections shouldn't be look it's a good agreement these people you know when I first did it they should all water and you're just extend after they have no idea about\nBusiness just extend after that would've been a disaster we're losing a hundred billion dollars\nA year in deficits at least at least to Mexico under NAFTA\nBut just look at the results and and a substantial amount accounted although a lot of people try and say it's pretty much even it's not even we lose a substantial amount so you know I think it's a very hard thing to defend but that's alright look I understand the world the politics I think as well as anybody\nI haven't been doing it that long but I actually have been 'cause I've been doing it on the other side and I do understand and you know they can take the greatest thing ever done\nAnd try and make it sound as bad as possible but this one stuff this one people are coming out for this one and saying that's incredible what we've been able to do yes behind you lose\nThinking this president now that you've answered several questions on trade I'd like to turn that don't have it all do you have do you use me do you have a question of trade well you know one or two more questions you interest several questions get don't do that that's not identify somebody who's\nBefore excuse me don't do this do you have a question on trade\nEntered several you have a question on trade my question is on jak at least she has an FBI should interview whoever that they believe is appropriate does that include Julie sweating it the third accuser and can you promise to really\nAfter they finished their appointments or president give me a question plus\nConclusively and very well I think it's been a very rough period of time I guarantee has never had a period of time like this\nWhen he was ... and everybody said oh this is going to go so quickly look people thought ten years ago that Brett Kavanaugh was going to be a Supreme Court justice because of his intellect because of his career\nBecause of the fact that there are no games you know now they talk about alcohol they talked about all of the things that you hear and frankly you take a look at that they're bringing up subject we would know about this over the last\nTwenty years Thirty years of his career\nYou know what happened to go back to high school and they're saying he drank a lot on the evening and high school we you know I Do I I happen to know some of the United states senators one who is on the other side\nWho's pretty aggressive I've seen that person in very bad situations okay\nI've seen that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising and you know uh\nI think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however what ever the senators want is okay with me they're going to be making a decision what ever they want is okay with\nMe go ahead and that's enough for me to do was saying\nI I think the press is treated me unbelievably unfairly fact when I Won I said the good thing is now the press finally gets it now they'll finally treatments\nNow than ever their logo but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico suffer [noise] no no please shut down thinking about how they're going to act out and you're going to be next you can go ahead\nI have two questions about judge Kavanaugh at first there are now concerns that he may have lighter myth characterized his drinking while testifying if they find that he did do you think that bars him from being here Supreme Court nominee\nWhile I watch I watch them I was surprised at how\nA vocally was about the fact that he likes beer and he's had\nA little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank I mean this is not a man that said that alcohol was absurd that he was perfect with respect to alcohol or do I thought he was actually going back so many years I thought he was a\nExcellent the interesting thing is though nobody asked them about what's happening in the last twenty five thirty years during his professional career because\nI there were no bad reports I mean there are bad reports on everybody in here most of the people sitting down there ... except for my\nParents were [noise] [laughter] how do we find one on him that um I think that's that's going to be that'll be the greatest shock of both of you\nKnow there are bad reports on everybody I'm looking at people I'm sort of\nLook at some of these people asking the questions okay\nLook at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam no no\nFor Fifteen Years he said he was a war hero\nHe fought in Da Nang province we call him Don King Richard downing that's just stick them done that he never went to Vietnam and he's up there are certain we need honesty and we need integrity this guy live when he was the attorney general's Connecticut\nSupport for NPR's brought you by the law firm of ... intellectual property group with offices in Minnesota in Los Angeles Inskeep ... group aims to help companies leverage the power of patents to protect their innovation you didn't find out more at ... dot com\nLook at his record and when he got out and we apologize she was crying the cheers were all over the place and now we acts like how do you take a look at the judge who has led an exemplary life\nI mean you're going back to high school because he had beer I think the judge has been a\nPretty amazing about describing his situation with alcohol and with beer\nLet me take a look at Cory Booker he ran Newark New Jersey into the ground he was a horrible in there and he made statements that when he was in high school or college what\nHe was doing he actually made the statement and now he's talking about judge Kavanaugh ... and I could go through a whole list of okay look at Diane Feinstein you're telling me about time Dianne Feinstein\nKnew about this two months earlier if she wanted a a really thorough investigation where all the time in the world she didn't have to wait until after the hearing was closed\nEssentially she should have said listen I have a problem I have this report I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing the hearings we had two months no she didn't do that she waited too we were closed and then she\nProbably leaked it but you know who am I to say but you probably did based on a very bad body language you know the day but more importantly under sense for her to have waited that period of time and now for you Democrats and I guess I'm including you do the media right I can\nBut for you for the Democrats to be\nTalking about we want more time to the FBI if you wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein\nBring this up now you know that you showed this or the Democrat she's not the only one she showed this other Democrats there were more than just heard that knew about this big confidential things confidential until the hearing was over after the hearing was over\nThey went public why didn't they do it during the hearing and we could have had all the time in the world you know why because they're dishonest people okay uh yes places\nFor us to go ahead you didn't answer my question Mr President said he did lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull him\nI don't think he did I look here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my totally good traits I don't trust [noise]\nWhenever they're looking for something good I say I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason\nCan you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I'd be I'd be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watch demand saying that he did have difficulty as a young man\nWas drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him in many many years they go back to high school\nYou know I graduated from high school and and I I while I did not drink I saw a lot of people drink they drink beer and then go crazy and you know there were in high school they were sixteen Seventeen years old and I saw a lot of it\nDoes that mean that they can't do something that they want to do with their life so it's a very tough thing I I really believe that he was very strong on the fact that he drank a lot and so I don't know whether it'd be\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

challenging it in court I think a Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for the n._r._a. for a long time um had as suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing I think that it will certainly withstand judicial scripts\nAnd be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to the a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws or the minimum age being one\nAll of which were a really designed to address the the type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so

A. B. E. welcome\nHello and thank you very much for the invitation Venezuela is tearing itself apart a freely elected government has become increasingly authoritarian an economy based on one of the world's greatest reserves of oil is in tatters\nHundreds of thousands of Venezuelans are now refugees can you walk us through how polarization contributed to this crisis\nVenezuela went through severe economic crisis in the Nineteen nineties with hyperinflation and tripling poverty rates and so that people rejected the political parties and felt like they were responsible that they had mismanaged things and had not\nDone things to to redress that crisis and that they were corrupt themselves so they were open to an outsider candidacy of Hugo Chavez who came along in Nineteen Ninety eight and said look the problems are\nThese political elites who have been running things into the ground and spending your money and we need to change things up and renew our democracy and redistribute the oil wealth to the poor so many in the country bought that he was elected but he came in with a very transformative agenda\nAnd he used a confrontational and very polarizing strategy to try to accomplish the change that he wanted to accomplish\nAnd as he did that he created a backlash\nMassive protests in the street and in one of those shots were fired a number of people were killed in the military blame Chavez and removed him in a coup ah which only lasted two days and he was brought back when his people came out into the street in the military change their mind and brought him back\nSo the confrontation came I think from the need for change from people suffering from that economic crisis and feeling like their political leaders were not paying attention to them\nWell you've written that when one party starts to dig in and refuses to compromise and games the system it's really crucial but the other side doesn't do the same thing but it should continue to play by the rules but in the example of Venezuela but you just given us the government is packed the courts and figured out ways to exclude the opposition from Congress\nIf the opposition tries to play by the rules does not just give the government license to run roughshod\nCertainly it does now but in the beginning the opposition had a chance and particularly after that coup when things had blown up and the last patients basically and went through a non democratic maneuver to remove him which was a military coup d'etat\nWhen that didn't work and he came back they had a chance to negotiate basic changes in the rules in who would be appointed to the courts and that kind of thing but instead they still wanted to focus on removing him from power\nA shop is Doug in himself so both sides dug in in this\nKind of existential fight to eliminate the other rather than walking back and trying to work together again and over time this\nPolitical fight got infused into the society said that the citizens themselves became just as divided in fact neighborhoods families were divided Caracas itself you would go to\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

democratically through elections by the time you get up to the present day\n... of course has since died things have gotten no better in fact probably worse under his yes successor Nicolas Maduro but let's step back a bit when you're talking about polarization the way you seem to describe it it's not just political extends to society in general\nYes exactly and that's when it becomes more and more difficult to result you know one way to define polarization is just differences and they growing distance in political leaders political parties beliefs in attitudes on specific issues if it's just that\nIt's possible you know to look for compromises and to negotiate for for people to choose okay we're going to like this party now and go in this direction and uh we don't like that next time around will elect a different party going to a different direction\nWhen it gets to this more emotional level what we call aspect of polarization because it involves feelings an aspect that's when we get into tribalism\nBoth political parties try to maximize their turnout by demonizing the opposition that's a technique mastered by a president who appeals to some of our bassist instincts\nFew have given more thought to what divides and unites us than Kwame\nAnd law at New York university law applies those skills to practical problems as the author of the ethicist column for the New York times his books include cosmopolitan ... the honor code\nHow moral revolutions happen and most recently the lies that bind rethinking identity Kwame Anthony Appiah joins us from his office at NYU it's great to talk with you again has very good to talk to now\nIn a world of ever more tribal identities your book looks at five factors\nCreed country color class and culture five factories we used to define ourselves\nAnd that others used to define us on examination none of these turns out to be simple all of them are based on mistakes admits is your own store your identity and example of the contradictions within and among what is supposed to be bright line definitions\nYes I mean I suppose one reason I thought about this so much and for so long is because I'm you know my mother was English my father was gone and I live in the United states I come from a particular\nAs everybody does from particular class background and so on and all of these things mean that when I meet people for the first time very often the upside of puzzled by\nBy what I might be [laughter] since since I'm sort of brown skinned and many people that guy looked like an Indian but I don't talk very much like an Indian and I'm like the guys see I don't like really say is I was raised to do like you see 'em and in fact my my mother\n... who's no longer alive I I've watched some video of her the other day and I realize that the person my mother most sounds like a ... as the English queens she had a very very particular kind of English accent\nWhen we do each of the category that you talk about for identity are vastly\nOver simplify but why do you think they retain such power\nWell I think because we're we're sort of programmed to thinking these essentially tribal kind of ...\nIt was adaptive a long time ago on the as it were evolution race of anti when we were just becoming a species and we're trying to deal with the fact that human beings lived in small groups which are competing with one another and we needed an a psychology that would made the groups held together so that they could compete it's very easy to town on clannish innocent human beings\nAnd that's one reason and then once it's turned on it takes a look to turn it off so that's why they're so persistent I think\nThat's a a big problem and I think there are solutions to it was one of which is obviously that unfortunately people have more than one identity and so sometimes we can use one identity to undo the the bad effects of another\nUh for example by the differences in their views about lots of political questions\nAnd in many ways I think people's fiscal views are generated by the sense that well this is the view of my tribe rather than by thinking well do I actually think about is the vast majority of people um but I Do not think that as it were all abortions should be permitted\nAnd the vast majority will also think that many should be and the disagreement is about the boundaries but the party's represent essentially the basically the too extreme views or\nThe Democrats currently holds the as where there should be no limitations a total and emotions and the Republicans hold them as many as possible inside let's try and change the interpretation that constitution\nTo make possible more so I think that there are many cases where the the parties are a very very sort of divided in these hostile way is generated by the sense of tribal identity\nAnd if we can get away from those identities for the Maryland and think of ourselves for example all as Americans which is another identity\nOr we might be able to to do more with them you've argued that just by you know exposing ourselves to different kinds of people we increase the likelihood of understanding it's just the idea you called Cosmo\nUnited States in red and blue urban and rural or we see that people you know self segregate themselves there are a lot of like minded people in uh Brooklyn New York and and in billings Montana what's the resolution that yes well I think that is a great difficulty there has been a kind of sorting and and\nPeople used to live more in in both in the country and in the city people used to live Lauren communities where there was regular interaction\nI live in New York City there's lots of\nRepublicans in New York City\nBut um I don't find that I meet a love [laughter] I think that's because ah in the current moment with all these tensions people\nTry to avoid politics a lot of the time so even if I Am leading Republicans are neither of us is going to bring politics up because there are more careful topics at the moment\nBut partly I think it's because you know the social circles are increasingly divided along these lines and that means as you say that the the mechanism of forming links and friendships across these divides\nWhich which is just to spend time together doing things I'm\nWorking together to run the league's going to church together and synagogue and temple and so on all those things if we don't have those then there's this mechanism which allows people of different identities to get along\nOr doesn't get off Russia's so it would be good to persuade more people to the bus to go through there because the hatred the good thing and it might help loosen people's attachments to these things\nWhich are very often you know bad for our society not every moments of racial identification is bad of course I'm\nA racial identification brings people to black churches were wonderful things happen I don't mean to say that every elements of\nRacial identification is bad but I think again it's one of these things where if we could just remember that we're yes we're black and white and the other one brown and so on but we're also we're all Americans are all New Yorkers or whatever it is um that would\nThe racial identities by saying to people you know this isn't actually as deep as we've been inclined to think might help\nWhen you talk about the social reality of race nowadays I Wonder if you on TALK a little bit about how it has become so front and center in today's America that is I Wonder if our\nEmphasis on race stands and it's a shorthand today for politics because race has been blackford fell by the right and by the laugh in terms of identifying their tribe is that a realistic or a fair way to look at the question\nWell clearly there is a connection between our political drivers of on a racial tribalism for reasons that I think by fully intelligible the vast majority of people who identify as black\nA dog I worked for the Democratic buddies far as I can tell for the foreseeable future unless they're probably gonna vote he changes\nAnd a similarly there are now increasingly people tend to stress the the sort of working class components of the of the white Republican vote but I think that's a bit misleading there are people of all classes who identifies white who\nUm think of the Democratic party I think as having to put a touch it's most extreme gone to war against white people\nFor seeing white people every day to confess to um crimes or to take advantage of privileges to where I Wish that often titled racial rivers and so on\nAnd so they feel but as it were backed into a corner and so they they think of themselves as unable to support the Democratic buddy even if they agree with that many of its policies\nUm on other topics so I think yes there is a connection between race and our political tribalism and it's producing again a system a situation where identity\nTrumps actual politics policy at Trump's people's thinking about well what do I want to do do I want to have an effective universal healthcare system uh\nThe current system then you'll be against it even if if you were able to stand back from your tribal identity you might say well actually this is a pretty good thing\nAnd the same is true I think you know among could think of things that the Democratic tribe doesn't I think reflects sufficiently about\nI think for example a lot of Democrats are more hostile and they respectively should be to ... the role of business plays in our society in generating the wealth which we can then ... to build a social welfare system and the health care system and the\nAnd the public institutions of our society so I'm the tribe isn't just gets in the way of uh in these contacts of thinking through to the issues there are better ways of thinking about the about trade than that and there are better ways of thinking about how we should think about Russia than just attending to whether the president likes the Russian leader\nBut because of the ... that's how these things end up uh working out\nWe're talking with Kwame Anthony Appiah a professor\nOf philosophy of law at New York University His new book is the lies that bind rethinking identity and let me raise another of your categories country the idea of what you've called cosmopolitan as we've talked about it before where many people define themselves as citizens of the world well it seems to be in retreat in many\nPlaces not least in this country nationalism is on the rise and not just nationalism but nativism and isn't there is one of those other\nAreas where these identities into trying it isn't is directly tied to race\nYes I think that there's always been a strand of American nationalism that was tied to racial identity I don't know whether we can show that the numbers if you increase but we certainly have seen a rise in the visibility of a form of American nationalism that's a racially
