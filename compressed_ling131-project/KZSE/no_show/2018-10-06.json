I I called truth is I see it and ah ah most bills are gray areas there are parts that I like in parts I don't like and the tax bill is no exception or the economy is strong it was getting stronger at the end of the Obama administration and has continued to I think we're on a bit of a sugar high for reasons I can describe\nA but that bill had components I did like a I agreed it was time to reduce the corporate income tax rate in this country to make us more competitive for the rest of the world and I also wanted to repatriate dollars from overseas because that's a great stimulus to our economy that part I agreed with\nThe part that was an fulfilled that was a great promise of this bill or was that middle income Americans would accrue benefits from it and the truth is that about eighty seven percent if not more of the benefits accrue to the top one percent of his country and corporations\nThat is a disservice to tens of millions of people in this country but what's particularly concerning to me is what it does to Minnesotans and Minnesotans in the third district\nUh we all know that Minnesota is higher tax state like California and New York New Jersey a lot of people take advantage of the state and local tax deduction in fact I almost fifty percent of their district residents do uh to the tune of over Seventeen thousand dollars per tax return\nSo that is why I imagine that twelve of your Republican colleagues in the house voted against that bill all of whom were from California New York and New Jersey that's the responsibility of service is your people over your party and that bill I think that a massive disservice to Minnesotans it to the favor\nIt's deep red states a bill that is designed to help them but most grave in my estimation\nA and answer you have for many years said that one of the greatest threats to our country is the explosion in our national debt and that is now exploded by the tune of two trillion with a T two trillion dollars because of that tax bill and or the way that you said that we can address that\nIs by attacking Medicare and Social Security Medicaid and the next Congress and I uh I find that to be so counter the principles and values of the third destroy\nThings up I never said we would attack Medicare Social security that future congresses you just said in fact the attacks from the past has met made Medicare stronger and Social Security stronger and the congressional budget office has affirmed that with more resources\nComing in you know the it's added to the deficit to hasn't had to sit on the short term but ... also says an acknowledges in the long term our debt to GDP ratio gets stronger overtime so we have to focus on the spending side of the equation and absolutely Affordable Care act needs to be addressed because those types of spending mandatory spending programs\nAre driving up costs Medicaid Medicare where the reforms are needed that we talked about need to be addressed\nUm the eighty three percent figure I think that you just mentioned now that's patently false it's been fact checked most of the benefits go to the middle class a higher percentage of taxes now that are paid are paid from wealthier individuals' those making over a million dollars like yourself\nVersus those who are middle and lower income folks those are the folks that I've been working to help those were the benefits went to I actually worked to fix the salt detection at one time it was proposed have no salt adoption I wanted to make sure it was there for middle income folks that's why we have the ten thousand dollar\nCap dean would want to restore that but if he restored it it would be only about a ten dollar tax benefit for those are in the middle income folks really thirty some thousand dollars for millionaires like dean and others and he didn't answer the question how he would have voted on the bill you voted on it I Would have worked I Would have worked hard to ensure that this economic expansion\nProgram is

we live in an era unfortunately we can't even decide on truth\nAnd I'm On a mission to elevate that you don't want to say whether you would vote for the villain for that bill in in that current I I Would vote\nTo reduce the corporate income tax rate I Would have done so over time anyone I would've I would've but we'll let let me explain because as a member of Congress you'll have that on her own yes or no let let me let me tell you ... if I had been a member of Congress I Would have advocated very strongly for the people in my state and for middle income Americans who should have derived more benefit from that tax bill that is what I'm saying\nAs simple as that I was not a member of Congress you were you served in the ways and Means Committee that wrote the bill you voted for it I Would have said that I Would have argued very very strongly\nFor more cruel benefits to middle income Americans that is truth I was not there to vote on a bill and I think it would it look different had I had that opportunity\nAnd I work to change the bill including medical expense deductions solved the actions that were put in the bill to help middle income folks lowering rates for everybody or Indians still won't say where he got he went on to vote for one day he didn't say it was disgusting it was awful it would be an easy vote\nTo vote no but now he won't say where he would vote in fact he wants to see if he will vote to repeal the bill is Nancy Pelosi said that's the first issue if we're in charge as Democrats we will vote on the house for is to repeal that how would you vote on that ...\nIt might if I might say what I said is disgusting is the cruel of eighty seven percent of the benefits to the top one percent of this country and I stand by that truth but ... and the other fact of the matter ... let me just let me just say though that but the other fact of the matter is that the tax bill that you wrote and voted yes on a is resulting in income tax\nProgram is supportive

Social Security or would you pledge to protect those programs in terms of the benefits they pay to people who depend on them or are changes needed that would cut into benefits to keep the programs financially solvent\nBut I don't look at this through the lens of the party our through partisanship I look at it as what's in the best interest of the nation an obstruction is not what this was about
