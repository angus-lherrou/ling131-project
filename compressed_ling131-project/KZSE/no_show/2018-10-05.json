[laughter] I I just want to pick\nPoint if the European\nMilitaries are feeble militaries these are tiny militaries and the reason they want us to be in Europe to protect them is so that they don't have to pay money for defense and uncles soccer pay the money to protect them\nAnd the idea that the Europeans are going to help us contain China is not a serious argument these countries have no power projection capability if we weren't in Europe protecting them they'd have to spend more money in themselves and we'd be free to pivot to Asia and we'd be free to fix the New York subways [laughter]\nSomebody I'll take that bet [laughter]\nCertainly in Europe to help protect Europe but the Europeans are partners as we project our power in the world that we can have a debate of the right or wrong way to protect us power and whether the right decisions have been made but the U.S has never gotten into a fight because the NATO allies have dragged us into that fight when you go to Europe when you go to the Baltics\nWhen you go throughout Western Europe France Germany\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from the ...

I just [noise]\n\nLet me just wrap it up and I don't even Ninety seconds [noise]\nWho's Russia represents absolutely no threat to the United states except those threats we ourselves and provoked mainly\nThrough NATO ex expansion proven himself contrary to the newspapers has not been mainly and aggressive leader you would think that's his middle name but are we act\nLike it or not is again a very great world power certainly militarily and diplomatic\nHere in lies the tragedy and all this all stop prudence rush\nAnyone's washing it should be America's number one national security partner in the world Washington squander that opportunity after Nineteen Ninety One and it's continued to squander it today by inventing are provoking threats\nResigning in Russia which do not exist\nBy just even going [noise] the resolution\nThat Russia threat is overblown Corey shocking to declare yes or no I agree that\nThe rest of the threat is overblown but not a because the Russians pose no threat to us our desire to pose a threat to us\nAt the invasion of Ukraine the invasion of Crimea the invasion of Georgia their military exercises that they are holding simulating nuclear weapons you send the Baltic states a\n[noise] five handle\nIs debating several different motions the theme is unresolved us national security or reminder of where we are we're halfway through this intelligence squared us debate are five panels were debating the state and the future of American national security\nAnd now you Ron I'm always high on the list of us security concerns\nAnd aspiring a nuclear power the backer of terrorism with the perpetual question isolate Iran squeeze it or tried to coax this radical nation in two more moderate behavior\nIt's the choice it's at the heart of our final resolution it is time to take a hard line on Iran Derek chalet on that resolution it's time to take a hard line on Iran\nI'll bet yes but I Am a yes but you know explain um Iran provides\nMaterial and political support to those who are trying to destabilize the middle east Iran's forces have been responsible for the deaths of thousands in places like Syria runs proxies had killed American civilians and our troops and Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons\nSo of course it's time to take a hard line against or on a that begins by forging the strongest possible international consensus Iran must know that its actions have consequences whether in form of economic pressure political isolation or even military response\nIn other words the best way to take a hard line is to present a United front\nAnd that's what the Iran nuclear deal did\nThe Iran nuclear deal did not solve all of our problems in with her on but it did put the brakes the number is urging serious ones so taking a hard line needs to be more than a slogan needs to be a means to an end it's not just about talking tough and beating your chest it's about pursuing smart policies that you get you closer to your goals thank you\nDerek ... [noise] the resolution of physical\nHard line on Iran Steven Cohen on this resolution to declare yes or no\nActually no you know Derrick I I mean I I I kind of giving the credit that he's made it needs to be persuasive case I mean I don't think it's all the charge like some of the things that have been set about Russia\nI'll take I'll take this shows Fisher but my feeling is is that the United states so Trump as we like to call the United states today\nHaving left the nuclear agreement and reimpose sanctions\nI asked myself what would a harder line results it's likely to create instability inside Iran\nThat is likely to spread to Iraq and Syria and elsewhere in the middle east\nCertainly it certainly would at least theoretically risk war depending on how hard this hard liners and that could involve the United states Israel and possibly Russia it will then increase or Russia's middle jury and energy producing role in the world because they've\nBeen going on sorry hundred times up thank you very much\n[noise]\nGoing out to Korea shockey on the resolution it's time to take a hard line on Iran please tell us how you declare\nIt is time to take a harder line on Iran they are the top state sponsor of terrorism in the world\nThey're arming Hezbollah and Hamas they are keeping bus Bashar al Assad I'm In power at and they are occasionally interdict in shipping and the straits of Hormuz through which an enormous amount of the world's oil translates\nA so so yes we should take a harder line both\nThe Trump Administration and the Obama administration had an unbelievable policy namely either you stop to nuclear weapons program or we will destroy it and\nI don't think that's credible out of either of the two governments we need a wider range of tools a to manage the around problem at the addict score the Iran problem is that\nThat domestic legitimacy on the foreign policy of Iran have the same route which is they view that themselves as a revolutionary power so taking a soft line on Iran doesn't result in Iran stopping doing these things\nLike the Kurdish hockey [noise] hard\nLine on Iran John Mearsheimer do declared yes or no I say no I take this resolution is a question uh dealing with President Trump's decision in May of this year to withdraw from the nuclear ...\nI think that that was a fundamental mistake but the question\nIs [noise]\nQuestion you want to ask yourself is what countries want nuclear weapons they want nuclear weapons because they understand they are the ultimate deterrent and if you're threatened you really want to have nuclear weapons why does Israel have nuclear weapons because it's leaders think they live in a dangerous neighborhood where they want to have the ultimate deterrent and they're back pocket\nWhat what's good for the goose is good for the gander so there's going to be a very powerful incentive for the Iranians to think the same way\nNow the hawks believe you can get really tough with the Iranians and you can beat them in to giving up nuclear weapons for ever I don't think that's going to happen\nFirst of all it's just going to reinforce the hard liners inside of Iran and second of all nationalism is a very powerful force and the idea that you could push the Iranians around I think is a misguided thought\nThank you for [noise]\nTime take a hard line on Iran last in the lineup of panelists to declare yes or no royal marker act or you yes or no\nYes uh I say I mean this is one of those issues that I think the Trump Administration was actually on the right thing I have to commend it at a stop the surreal situation where the United states was\nFeeding tens of billions of dollars into the Islamic republic into itchy eyes ... throughout the region for\nA short rest for the production of centrifuges it\nMakes no strategic or moral sense\nWhy we would want to give money to a regime that is gauge the mass\nSlaughter in Syria why we would want to give money to a stage that is building his laws throughout the Shiite regions of the middle east I just think this is not particularly since the Jaycee be LA was such a very very bad deal it's as leaky if it's got his many holes in Swiss cheese and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem rose right temporarily ten to Fifteen Years so we could work on the other aspects of Iran's behavior that posts such a threat to the United states the problem now that we pulled out of the nuclear deal when you go to Europe when you got that the middle east what they're talking about is American policy not Iran's policy\nAnd I don't believe that Iran has actually benefited that much from the uh the nuclear deal I mean you're on and people were on the streets and they actually thought the nuclear deal was a bad deal for them\nSo the idea that now we're going to engage in some sort of negotiation to get a better deal from from our perspective we're still Iran to me is fantasy John ... yeah I\nI Want to respond to a point that Korea made and tied that into a point that roommate you're critical of the Iranians for destabilizing regimes in the region is there any country that's destabilized more regimes than the United states\nOf America\nRespects funny I Want to bring the topic back to the focus back to Iran at the moment and go and you know I I understand but I Want to bring\nAnother dimension that we haven't discussed yet which is this notion that's been out there since the Islamic republic came to be that there's a there's a moderate elements there's a there's a there's a there's a group there to go to although the first car

did you decide to write this piece\nAm a big supporter of meat you of women especially what we're seeing long silenced women come forward and tell their stories\nI think it's all to the good although it's causing a lot of French in conversation\nAnd people who come forward absolutely need support from loved one's family friends a therapeutic community if they see that out and they should be believed within that community my concern is that\nThis hash tag cannot apply when a specific man is accused and some kind of adjudication investigation or life altering effects happen\nWe simply can't believe one party over another uh just on the basis\nOn how justice works so ... what\nAre you asking for practically I mean how do you both tell women and tell survivors of sexual assault that they will be believed that come forward but then also a but we're not sure that this man did if you've got to show the evidence like what how do you\nHow do you handle that well as I say that I that we're hearing a lot of testimony from women saying here is something that happened to me\nAnd they're leaving in at that and and there have been interesting stories from women saying I'm not going to name this person this happened a long time ago\nI thought about it it's not going to do a any good to disrupt his life or mine okay so that's one set of uh issues\nAnd that is a fairly self contained but as we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings\nWhen someone says is accused\nWe need some way to weigh the two sides because sometimes we have men we've seen in the me too movement saying a as Lucy Kate yup what these women said is right I did it\nUh often times we don't ah and I think we can draw some concerning lessons from campus where over the past six years or so uh there's been kind of a

you\nProtect the accused without sending a message to survivors that it's basically you've got to prove it\nThat's the question isn't it [laughter] I don't have the final answer in some ways we can

earlier this year Apple's chief financial officer said the company would buy back shares of stock one hundred billion dollars worth wow\nWhen you have a trillion dollar company you can do that this was part of a bigger trend of American companies engaging in stock buybacks to explain what exactly they are and why they're sometimes controversial return to rain accounted Stacey Vanek Smith of the Planet Money team\nBefore we get into the whole debate over buybacks we should explain what they are probably okay it's when a company decides it's going to buy its own stock\nAnd it finds that stock from the people who own the stock from its shareholders and gender the company will pay its shareholders little premium for those shares so why do companies do this we put this question to Johnny Cochrane\nI'm a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford\nAnd I also have a blog grumpy economist\nAnd here's what grumpy John says about buybacks\nA company makes a lot of profits either 'cause they're you know apple and Facebook and money is pouring in the front door or the corporate tax cut increased above so so they got money sitting around\nYou're seeing a sign of our company will manage that they're not gonna take this dream of profits in may crazy investments they don't know how to make they're going to give it back to the owners\nSo they can give cash back to the owners AKA the company's shareholders which seems fine right I mean it's better than wasting the money ... you know is an economist at the Roosevelt Institute\nShe says that when companies are giving all of their extra cash to shareholders it means they're not investing more money in workers' she looked specifically at what Wal Mart could have done with the money it's planning to spend on buybacks and twenty Eighteen\nShe calculated it could've increased to pay a one million fulltime workers by about ten thousand dollars per year\nTo pay their workers so that families can live above the poverty line we have to look at what they're using their money for and say that that's simply not true\nBut John Cochran says companies are supposed to answer to their shareholders it's actually their duty is not their duty he says to benefit the wider economy\nThe onto a company has to make money on behalf of its shareholders this does benefit workers because when a company is run efficiently it has to hire people and it has to make those people productive and in the end high productivity is how wages are are beat up but\nI think it's a misunderstanding to think that the company makes money and then decides who to give presents to and maybe give presents to workers or maybe it gets prisons to owners or maybe decides to give a bonus to the electric company just to be nice to them [noise] ah it's just not how it works\nSo well this debate has been happening buybacks have grown by a lot back in the early eighties ran rules around buybacks were relaxed by the Reagan Administration companies an F and P five hundred we're spending about four percent of their profits on buybacks in the past few years Lenore says that's jumped to more than fifty percent\nIt will be probably one trillion dollars spent on stock buybacks this year that's more than President Obama spent on the Recovery Act and that's just in twenty Eighteen alone\nSpeaks stock buybacks have come under increasing scrutiny from leaders on Wall street and even from lawmakers in fact a few months ago legislation was introduced to the Senate\nThat would restrict stock buybacks and take us right back to the Nineteen eighties

allegations and I believe they reached out till eleven people interviewed can which was twice the amount that the Senate originally requested\nOh so they went beyond what the Senate centered asked for

about what they said about running and went to ...\nKnow every single women run that I talked to has had at least some instance of harassment and it's mainly people giving them unwanted comments and attention while they're on the trail\nBut one runner I spoke with a leash a crop on that was actually racing in this Sunday's marathon she had a particularly scary story last summer she was on the north cedar like regional trail and the west metro when a man came out of the woods near the trail and actually grabbed her around the waste from behind and this is in broad daylight and she had her dog with her\nYou know thankfully her dog was able to scare the man away um and and then another woman Jesse eaten in Duluth she told me the story that I think a lot of women will recognize and say hey me too I Do that too\nWell she was on vacation in New York she decides to go for a run around in nearby park and you know it being an unfamiliar areas you going down a one way street and a truck that\nWas pushing her slow down and then those few seconds when she realized what was happening you know she she immediately looked for an escape route trying to figure out how fast you need to run to a nearby house for help and how about you need a screen that sort of stuff oh\nWhat are women do to protect themselves on the trail yeah you know it's such a problem that more women are taking their own safety and to their own hands even though you know a lot of them say it's so frustrating that they're the ones who need to change their behavior and not their attackers\nYou know some woman report only running and groups or with their phones that safety apps track where you are and require you to check in\nSome women change their altogether or only train at the gym with their cameras or other people around to help others like crop all Nikki they run with her dogs for added protection\nOne woman I spoke with recently bought a pair of headphones I don't actually cover your ears they pipes sound into your cheek bones so it gives her the ability to still hear everything that's going on around her oh um and actually in August a race organizer team also did something pretty neat during the women rock race in St Paul\nThey had to self defense instructor teaching runners how to defend themselves against surprise attacks like someone pulling your ponytail from behind or being stopped\nYour fingernails to escape and assault and you know I spoke to trainers daugherty and she told me that she had noticed enough chicken women runners being attacked and decided she was going to do something

raised Catholic ... deep sense of right and wrong and he wondered for rest of his life if what they had done was the right thing\nSmall thought this could make a great graphic novel with his friends okay he took notes and went back to his studio to draw\nAnd everything went very well for about three months until I realized that something was wrong with what I was doing and I couldn't put my finger and\nThen a writer friend told him the best books have some of the author in them\nAnd if you're going to go that route then you're probably going to have to explore your own adolescence at Thirteen and you're probably gonna have to deal with the thing that scared you the most at that time\nSo David Small dug deep than he reshaped the story\nHaving been bullied in school um was part of it\nIt became a story of Russell a teenager in Ohio whose mother takes off with his father's best friend his dad then decide to move to California there Russell finds himself isolated and increasingly desperate again this is based on small own experience\nWhen I found a group of my peers I Would have done anything anything betrayed anyone to be part of that group to be looked up to\nAlthough he says he didn't do anything quite as bad as happens in the book small says he drew and regions\nFind the story the last ... had to do is cutting out three major characters several major incidents and also cutting out a little psycho passed because he was beginning to take over my story\nIt wasn't easy small describes revising a graphic novel in terms of falling dominos a change in one panel can mean changes in dozens that follow it and small holds himself to a very high standard you finally finished the book it was four hundred pages\nShe sat down and read it one more time\nAnd I said I can do better than this\nSo he took himself off to Mexico for three months\nAnd I read through the entire book on a piece of good Italian rag watercolor paper [noise] doing that made my washes ... and my lines have a wonderful quality and then I was happy and then I turned it in\nDavid Small we'll read from home after dark at seven this evening at ... palace books in Minneapolis it's a dark story of the cruelty of youth and the carelessness of adults it is however quite beautiful and David Small says it's possibly the best thing he's ever done\nSo there is a possibility that people could change their minds down the line um I Will say that that like I said is quite rare we are expecting some people including um you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins and we may hear from her at that time so we did it one of those things where we're going to have to watch this\nOn that final vote which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural do today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning\nKelsey I you know I Wonder if you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and\nAnd what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and an all this contracts feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up which is not normal um there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president I'm from just about any vote of any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about in American politics for the past year or so\nThere seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they passed a bill they they are doing those basic pieces of governance but\nAs soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting just the basics of government on Washington if they can continue to do that or if these fights towers them for more negotiations down the road\nWe'll turn to to uh or other colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington Scott David so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of the food we have Grassley I I think Dianne Feinstein is going to be coming out but

role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford\nFor many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said she was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information\nBut Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of\nThis has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this\nMidterm election terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will outlast the remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years for example somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nSo I don't remember I remember that I had a very ugly remember something in the past about that yeah\nYou know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but race from mid summer until now and a lot of people see the cabin off fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling or under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fit\nIt's gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as cabinet under siege\nA compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford\nDeserves to be hurt let's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of that\nAssault even under the lowest standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this cases even weaker than that Dr Ford

enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington who staked out opposition to judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominate\nThere is simply no reason then to the judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us\nThe Democratic strategy used against judge Kavanaugh has made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair and ... the process is\nThirty one years ago the Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork or playbook remains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become sort\nListening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the form of vote to actually confirm or not\nWould probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties and ultimately rejected\nShe said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh's being ... which is the way the conservatives refer to this new Totenberg is that a fair comparison well I\nActually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert ... nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how Bork fared and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal interests did have some ads against him and they were chump change compared to what the money that spent today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes of vi in me um but\n... views it turned out he answered the questions quite forthrightly like I did have very strong and he had very strong views and quite as it turned out in the view of many Americans and their senators extreme views\nAnd this case Kavanaugh has pulled his punches quite deliberately are not quite said what does the U.S was actually correct\nSo ... for example said he's sticking to his you that the one person one vote decision was wrong Kavanaugh or would not really expresses use on almost anything he he would always say that's Supreme Court precedent um I I as a judge had to follow the Supreme Court precedent or\nThings like that so they're really they're not

V. and why\nIs that contention was false so just to be clear that's actually a lie because WC she'll Kathy and Carol Evan all fact check that claim on providing health care is a more right but didn't provide your own employees was actually true on that claim but isn't it that was the case isn't the issue in the\nBig for that as something as a hallmark of our campaign because we're showing that\nThe political nonsense that weird that his litter in our airways uh uh that has got to come to an end that's an example of at least using a little bit of humor which I Will bring to this side of this discourse ah and I intend to show that we can do this differently and we can do this better a principal over party a\n... ah the collaboration that we have lost a and the hallmark of this campaign and my slogan is everyone's invited\nTo a different way of doing it or some recommended against doing it uh but joined Republicans joining this campaign joining Democrats independence with even libertarians\nAnd sending that message they're advertising the sad truth is that when you're subject to about eight million dollars in atrocious misleading and false attack ads are ... ability to share some truth\nAnd frankly uh that that is my responsibility I'll continue to do so\nIt's like well I'm I Would just say that everything Dina saying I'm actually practicing if you're looking for someone who's collaborative who cooperates who compromises to get things done that's exactly what I've been doing as a member of Congress whether it's working with members of our own delegation unimportant legislation like\nAnti human trafficking and sex trafficking efforts with senator club a sharp a or a standing up to my own party or in and being bipartisan or pushing some issues on climate change a for instance is so bipartisan efforts are important number three in the entire Congress\nFor getting bipartisan coauthors of my bills that includes the Senate and house by the way so it's a model I think that it's important for legislators to listen and the follow up and cooperating and collaborate\nRespond to your uh perhaps at the very top in getting co signers but congressman that same website indicates that I think you're\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLowest unemployment and now since Nineteen sixty nine for the country actually the third district in Minnesota has the best unemployment record the lowest unemployment in the entire country at one point nine percent so tax reform as about making inefficient condom even stronger\nA and and make modernizing our tax code so it's everything we said it should be lower rates for everybody and at the same time building for growth so we've seen consumer confidence that record levels small business or competence at record levels more more wages going up\nPay raises a as well as investment in productivity increasing so we've gone from two percent girls to four percent growth and honestly the results are much more stronger than any of us really expected they would be the only ten months dean fields who do you have voted for that bill\nWell I'll tell you the ... I I called truth is I see it and uh uh most bills are gray areas there are parts that I like in parts I don't like and the tax bill is no exception or the economy is strong it was getting stronger at the end of the Obama administration and has continued to I think we're on a bit of a sugar high for reasons I can describe\nA but that bill had components I did like a I agreed it was time to reduce the corporate income tax rate in this country to make us more competitive for the rest of the world and I also wanted to repatriate dollars from overseas because that's a great stimulus to our economy that part I agreed with\nThe part that was an fulfilled that was a great promise of this bill or was that middle income Americans would accrue benefits from it and the truth is that about eighty seven percent if not more of the benefits accrue to the top one percent of this country and corporations\nThat is a disservice to tens of millions of people in this country but what's particularly concerning to me is what it does to Minnesotans and Minnesotans in the third district\nUh we all know that Minnesota is higher tax state like California and New York New Jersey a lot of people take advantage of the state and local tax deduction in fact almost fifty percent of their district residents do uh to the tune of over Seventeen thousand dollars per tax return\nSo that is why I imagine that twelve of your Republican colleagues in the ...\nSupport from Minnesota Public radio comes from the E.

GDP ratio gets stronger over time so we have to focus on the spending side of the equation and absolutely Affordable Care act needs to be addressed because those types of spending mandatory spending programs\nAre driving up cost Medicaid Medicare where the reforms are needed that we've talked about the need to be addressed\nUm the eighty three percent figure I think that you just mentioned no that's patently false it's been ... fact checked most of the benefits go to the middle class higher percentage of taxes now that are paid are paid from wealthier individuals' those making over a million dollars like yourself\nVersus those who are middle and low income folks those are the folks that I've been working ... help those were the benefits went to I actually work to fix the salt detection at one time was proposed to have no salt the action I wanted to make sure it was there for middle income folks that's why we had the ten thousand dollar\nCap dean would want to restore that but at the restored it it would be only about a ten dollar tax benefit for those are in the middle income\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from the E.

R. go dot com\nIt's hard to have a debate when truth doesn't rise to the top and that's why I'm running for Congress Mike or this is what is so troublesome in our discourse\nSpending millions of dollars on television or disseminating lies and false woods or even in live debates or the truth congressmen is truth and all of these people took the time to do a little due diligence and and do some research that would elevate but now we live in an era unfortunately where we can't even decide on truth\nAnd I'm On a mission to elevate that you don't want to say whether you would vote for the villain for that bill in in that current I I Would vote\nTo reduce the corporate income tax rate I Would have done so over time anyone I Would I Would have ... will let let me explain because as a member of Congress you all of that I Know what yes or no let let me let me tell you ... if I had been a member of Congress I Would have advocated very strongly for the people in my state and for middle income Americans who should have derived more benefit from that tax bill that is what I'm saying\nAs simple as that I was not a member of Congress you were you served on the ways and Means Committee that wrote the bill you voted for it I Would have said that I Would have argued very very strongly\nFor more cruel benefits to middle income Americans that is truth I was not there to vote on a bill and I think it would have looked different had I had that opportunity and I work\nTo change the bill including medical expense the dachshund solved the actions that were put in the bill to help middle income folks lowering rates for everybody or Indians still won't say where he got he went on to vote for one day he didn't say it was disgusting it was awful it would be an easy vote\nTo vote no but now he won't say where he would vote in fact he wants to see if he will vote to repeal the bill is Nancy Pelosi said that's the first issue if we're in charge as Democrats we will vote on the house for is to repeal that how would you vote on that\n... it might if I might say what I said is disgusting is the cruel of eighty seven percent of the benefits to the top one percent of this\nIn fact I have to be and the other fact of the matter ... let me just let me just say though that but the other fact of the matter is that the tax bill that you wrote and voted yes on\nA is resulting in income tax increases for a lot of Minnesotans thousands of Minnesotans do you agree with that do you agree that thousands of Minnesota that their taxes cut\nThere are winners asked barely there are some winners and there's some losers and the losers are across socioeconomic spectrums and that's the truth and I speak with them every day and you know that to be the truth as a tax increase on thousands of people in our state and I would have done differently\nThat is another issue um and so where do you stop where do you draw the line I'm fine with it how do you rent Spanish and let me ask you a she wasn't really sure actually trying to do that how is Congress done on overseeing this administration\nWell Congress has an important check and balance I think the most important check and balance is one making sure that the sanctity of our elections is secure um investigations from the intelligence community in both the house and the Senate going on\nBut most importantly the independent counsel that was appointed for me\nAnd I was one of the first Republicans that said we need an independent counsel when the FBI Director was fired the FBI is neutral law enforcement are bitter and that's the time to point independent counsel that investigation is going on and they will get to the bottom of anything that's happening it's still continuing today [noise]\nLet me turn to another question from a listener who asked about gun control it's been a year just a little more than a year since the Las Vegas shootings should the federal government pass any new gun laws a congressman start with you\nThink there are new gun laws that we can pass a we've passed several this this year that enhanced background checks to making sure you've got better information for domestic abuse that are getting put into the background check system\nYour background check system is only good as the data that you have in it\nAnd we also lifted the ban on gun violence research ah by the CDC and others that's important to do but I think we can go a step further as well by having what I refer to his gun violence restraining orders and it's one of the reasons why I got together with\n... she's the representative represents the Parkland community where the tragedy happened also not long ago and we came up with uh the concept of out of federal level having gun violence restraining order so if tips are given and someone thinks you know a family member or friend or someone is going to be a threat to themselves or to society to others\nThey can actually have law enforcement step in confiscate weapons and you can have due process you can have probable cause it's worked in ...\nPublic in states as well and so some groups don't like that uh\nBut I think it is an appropriate response and the direction to go not only to prevent tragedies\nBut also prevent a lot of suicides and that's been a driving epidemic as well dean Philip well I I think we should point out that in fact I just recently the n._r._a. uh elevated Congress in ... grade from an a minus two and a ah migrate is an F and by the way I'm a firearms owner minds myself\nA congressman pulse and it's taken over twenty thousand dollars from the n._r._a. or Congress has done almost nothing almost nothing\nAnd everybody listening does this all over the course of Congress impulses pretend you're a career in Congress to make our neighborhoods our schools our streets in our country safer from gun violence\nAnd I talk about gun violence prevention not gun control I talk about gun violence prevention there are five steps common sense steps that this nation can take with a thoughtful Congress and thoughtful administration and play starting with universal background checks just about every Democrat and Republican in this country agrees we need them why we don't have that is unbelievable to me\nUh we also I Believe should a return to the notion of an assault weapons ban we do not allow hand grenades or bombs or automatic weapons or Brazil because on our streets why our nation allows weapons I cannot cause mass human carnage in a matter of moments on our streets is something that I think we've got to take a serious look at\nWe also are a nation that should ensure that every public school has robust mental health professionals on staff to take care of our kids that the youngest ages I Do not understand why we have not made those investments so that we would save lives and money down the road when he'd anti bowling programs in every school because we all know how many young children are being bullied and what results from doing so\nAnd Congress impulse instead the CDC can now studied the issue but this Congress has not afforded one dollar to allow them to do so\nAnd by the way when we had a a growing a highway fatality crisis in the Nineteen sixties and seventies you know our nation came together and looked at the region\nWe could solve it and we didn't ban cars we made cars safer we made streets safer we let them better win that seat belts were in every car and airbags we should look at this issue the exact same way but I'm going to close this by saying until we reduce the money in politics\nAnd the stranglehold that the gun lobby and other lobbies have on Congress a Congress that has bought and sold systematically\nWe will not be able to address a lot of these issues and that's why nothing has been done on gun violence in ten years of Congress also has been in office I intend to do much better by the people I Hope to represent\nLaw I'm confused we lifted the ban on gun violence research ah we actually enhanced background checks or we made those changes we fix next um I voted for support and more dollars going into the next background check system I'd actually focused on things that we can actually find solutions to um you know we have a constitutional right\nTo bear arms now you can say you want to get rid of that but don't be dismissive of it right and so that's been the polarization has happened to prevent it progress on a lot of these issues\nSo the ones that I focused on we've gotten some done across the finish line but bipartisan support I think will lead to gun violence restraining order so we're making progress and that's the response Congress some of us are trying to take\nAll right but I I this is really important like lifting the ban which was in place the Dickey Amendment lifting a ban on the CDC from studying the issue is one thing that's easy\nWhat Congress should have done and should do and I hope to encourage once I had the honor of serving\nA is to mandate that they do so and afford resources to do so I ... anybody who would disagree with that I Would really surprised me I and I I I have an understanding of the second amendment and I support it and Americans do have the right to bear arms I'm One of them I think we also ... comments and there's got to rule the day well\nCommonsense is lift the gun ban the violence research right in the ban on gun violence research which had been in place for decades so of course you need to provide resources for that the mental health care funding that's been coming we passed a significant bill just reason\nMeasure the end of the year but it's important resources for school violence is a school violence programs across the country and that was a follow up to the legislation that passed earlier last spring the same percentage that I'm voting with Trump lock step and barrel that was fine and passed into law\nA lot to do better and we will let me just get to another listener question on climate change first are humans responsible and second what specific actions do you support to address it and dean Philip start with you\nAnd I ... I Believe I Believe in science first and foremost I cannot even believe a statement like that has political connotations in this day and age a Congress impulse and not long ago said he wasn't smart enough to know with climate change was real uh and if it's a caused by human beings\nAre I Believe that human beings are playing a role or and I have some thoughtful solutions because right now again Congress has done nothing to address what I consider to be one of the foremost challenges not just our country faces but this entire world\nAnd if we hope to serve our children and our grandchildren and preserve not just our country but planet for the future we have got to act\nI favor a notion that has Republican roots in fact one that is very deeply supported by someone who hosted a a fundraiser for Congress impulse and just last weekend who participated in my climate change form a the notion is a carbon feeding dividend program which is not a tax on energy because it returns every single dollar every single dollar\nTo American taxpayers anybody with a Social Security number we have got to provide incentives to migrate from fossil fuel based economy to a green energy economy are and that is unanimous and most people I speak with everyday including Republicans who are conservation says at the heart of kinds of conservatism\nThat is how we do this together we're like minded but Congress has inactivity or unwillingness to address the most grave situation this country faces has got to change\nHer well we ... we may be like minded on this where this is an issue of concern that needs to be addressed absolutely it's one of the reasons why I'm In the climate solutions caucus no you have to join that caucus with the Republican and the Democrats\nAnyone that is collected additional information and make policy decisions based on that information that is coming in so I care very deeply about conservation protecting our environment protecting the boundary waters it's very authentic to me a Minnesota's Yellowstone but at the same time\nUm you know just ... pushing for it a a carbon tax or an energy plan that will raise taxes on gasoline or on utilities that will hit a lot of middle and lower income folks that you can have some sort of scheme or you're giving refunds rebates on sort of thing but you're going to have pain\nFor a lot of people uh that use those resources it's a very regressive tax\nUh and I think that's the wrong direction to go to ... the question was what I said well you do well my solution is this we need to come up with additional resources right or is is a bipartisan group folks\nOn Monday metro forecast\nI'm NPR News chief meteorologist Paul ... start your day with a weather updates from NPR News new text word whether to six
