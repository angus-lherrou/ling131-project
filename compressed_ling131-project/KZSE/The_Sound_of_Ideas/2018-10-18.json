there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority and the communities that I was in\nUm she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were shipped 'em and we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says\nHappy Halloween because it's missing an end to have the the misfit toys or Hanukkah um it is it's still very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nHundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened\nUh and that was terrible but now we live and sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been

people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAre you know officially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because there's the ... and like I think yeah\nAnd I and I would say a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed word felt like something is wrong with me and no one\nA couple of child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't nobody\nWas inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize is inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're watching the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take 'em you\nKnow or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I thought I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a sentence has been a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give\nIt it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have you know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space where you where you can like immerse yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of\nWhat you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references and blow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nWell TV made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and\nHaving an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and all have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it's a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment\nI'll I'll get paid for by putting into the story later so\nAll for me [noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running bow jak witches and Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect ... like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "18"}
