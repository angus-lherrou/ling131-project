yourself\nI think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemand and thing to do but then I started understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of a leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some\nNotion of like a you know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your or to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her\nWhen you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that\nTo you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot of away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish we're really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work I'd gotten in a way of of becoming\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you are getting out in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really you know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good\nFrom my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was a performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that Jews go to graduate school in film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not conducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't have in the

you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband [noise] he said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents [noise]\nAnother character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character as your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about oh you know well you know oh honey you know well if you just give that to your grandfather\nAnd I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike you didn't want to get into it and I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambling he was really like a character\nSo you make three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when you live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second feeling the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home and he was not\nSupport for Minnesota Public radio comes from ...

Mary she know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and\nThen um yeah there's a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother was it when at Harvard and ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square and Porter Square off mastiff\nSo was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students yeah it was really\nIt was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah [noise] yeah it was just a book Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting a ... like twenty five was crazy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sound of Ideas", "city": "Rochester", "day": "04"}
