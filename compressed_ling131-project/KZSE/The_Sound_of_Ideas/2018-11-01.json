where they're going to come out so the\nLarger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life\nAs it is and during for example the recent cabinet confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\n[noise] in what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nThe court docket is almost entirely discretionary the justice to decide which cases they want to hear and too often they choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused herself anymore than Clarence Thomas ... part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself or herself at a lower court you can always substitute\nProgramming is
