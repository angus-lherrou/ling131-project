watch the video of two protesters with Senate\nYou know hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women had been treated for so long the way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter\nIf you look at the way flake changed his position afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now this is very much the subjective Rebecca Traister his new book good in mad revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe book and binds a kind of history of women's uprisings with an analysis of the me too movement\nTraister is written for New York magazine el the New York times and the Washington Post and her last book was called all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation\nRebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh both testified about her sexual assault allegations\nRebecca there's no way to avoid this we are talking now just hours after the\nSenate Judiciary committee has done its questioning ... there was a very specific story being told by professor Ford as well as as as we near us and others in a very particular ... what did the specifics tell you\nSpecifics of their stories yeah well we are getting a very full and detailed view of cultures around wealth white\nFundamentally patriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite um friday\nHard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free um socialist\nWhite men who were all on pads toward immense power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with it and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement it's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good and bad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf\nBut more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built and who would still excludes and systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about anger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good um what's that you often\n[noise] um it was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um that take some doing oh God yes [noise]\nDidn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean I was very much\nWell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and\nUm there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women I was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been lingered by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I had been pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class\nUm that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a pod cast with a bunch of women\nAnd one of them had said\nAbout the white young white men who was like the classic Bernie supporter like\nShe had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her\nWhere the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware\nOf this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leave him be it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women do not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be Phyllis Schlafly you're right I understand and have sympathy\nWith that like just let 'em right right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys would that going in my own head\nAnd I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also thinking about white women

work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months since\nIt is interesting that the a lot of the exemplars of\nConstructive anger in the book historically are black women mhm I'm Shirley Chisholm Florence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her great hats or Rosa Parks and ... and ... and of course the the mother of Emmett Till\nThat's not by any coincidence that's not that's not by accident\nNot at all women
