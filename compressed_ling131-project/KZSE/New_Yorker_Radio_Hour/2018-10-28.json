destroyed um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect the dots between what's going on politically nationally as well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\nJust an example of the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occurred to me it just wasn't something ever\nLike maybe I thought it would run for school\nBoard or something like something small local when my kids were

representative carbon for an interview and she sent the following statement I Am a proven record of standing up to oil\nOf our community then she listed her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\nBut here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics in both the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking is made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state\nIn America and and that's brought in a lot of different players including Snowe go and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline refinanced our top priority for highly skilled engineers environmental scientists wildlife biology and geology design also I Want to follow the safest wrong with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP is a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline moved natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east to markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas\nWe were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop was a hundred miles west of accident in the small town of blows or fail\nAt blooms gun shop we met Ralph and Doris blue\nTheir shop as a small building in a modified garage on their property or shot guns are mixed up with things stun guns in Cedar and its infested was quick\nTo thirty five years and make a joke you like it is it going to get any better\nRole to me by plane went right through their

differentiate between ... one of the guys goes I think I'm not certain things that John ... sort of gifts for whites to everything everything\nI mean the thing is people who don't aren't familiar with that second most exciting things are either factor opinion and we check the facts and we leave that alone but to us the\nBigger the biggest thing that we work on is what I refer to him as fact based opinion in other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to crack they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more kind of an art it's kind of back into editing you make there are kind of having such judgments that you make and of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make common such adjustments but you know we are journalists so\nUm when we shouldn't show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on and I'm like gosh I Believe you have a phone call scheduled chef of a Mexican restaurant\nAlive and we train\nThem so I mean the plane the plane was damn
