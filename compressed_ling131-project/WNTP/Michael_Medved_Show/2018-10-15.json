[noise]\n[noise] yes All right so I remember\nThe story that I just saw it was in USA Today yesterday [noise]\nJoy villa I'm a Republican for the first time in my life the extreme left is out of control [noise] joy villa in it right to his column in USA Today she is a well known that too many of course is the uh the singer and songwriter\n... she was at my talk at valley best show\nShe's a she's a black woman she's beautiful she's talented she's alive she's great she's bright she's everything\nAnd I didn't even know she's a Republican or not a Republican here she is the less the left is out of control I'm a public figure a new Republican I'm going to take my energy where it counts the polls you should to whether your share my views are not\nThat that's fascinating\nBut because he has been blessed with such wonderful opponents really I mean nobody could ask for better opponents than President Trump has received Elizabeth\nWarren really uh we are going to now have the great one drop of Native American blood debate\nOf this entire thing is incredible and Elizabeth Warren is trying to collect at least some of the people operating her name want her to collect the million dollars President Trump has promised if she can prove she's an Indian and how does she proves she's Indian\nOr we will get to that it's deeply embarrassing and it really does show that there are some not many but some points of commonality between contemporary liberals and Nazis\nReally yes really will get to that on the Michael Medvedev show will also get to the a great debate about the civil war and and again\nA President Trump ... did not show him self when he was talking about general grant and generally to be a particularly sophisticated historian he wasn't hired for that but\nHe absolutely did not inappropriately praise a Confederate general and they shouldn't be condemned for it and the president helped and they've shown and in fact they were forced to retreat\nExactly why it is so many Americans and it's left right and center distrust mainstream media\nAnd rightly distrust mainstream media and most of all President Trump has been blessed this week at the beginning of the week\nWith the\nUtterly inexplicable desire\nOf Hillary Clinton to inject yourself into this democratic campaign\nWhy is this is a mystery is she some kind of secret agent for the Republican Party is that possible\nI mean she blew the campaign kind of everybody knows that she blew the campaign against Donald Trump President Trump acknowledges it and and now she is doing her very level best\nTo uh to to basically um\nHelp President Trump and help Republicans in the forthcoming campaign this November OK Hillary Clinton was on CBS on Sunday Morning\nAnd it it's one of those things will posted up at our website at Michael ... dot com you really have to see it to get a a full force of how uncomfortable she looks why submit yourself to this I I don't understand I don't understand what is\nPossibly to be gained Jerry except to strengthen Republicans\nAnd why is that she's not a political newcomer she's been around the block a thousand times she was a problem\nFor the first campaign that Bill Clinton lost and and people forget this this is part of ancient history but Hillary and bill gotten married bill got elected to be the governor of Arkansas very young man and then when he ran for\nReelection the first time he lost and he lost because Hillary was the issue because she hadn't changed her name yet she was still Hillary Rodham she's still have those coke bottled glasses that I remember her wearing from law school\nAnd uh she she was a much more of an quote outspoken feminist will eventually change and she campaigned\nAlongside bill but given the fact that she has this long long experience in the political world\nHow could you be so utterly unprepared for questions that are very obvious and this this comes especially after we spoke to Ken Starr who's now standing American and has just written a terrific book and again I recommend the book hardly to everybody\nThe um\nThe book by Ken Starr which is posted up at our website at Michael met a dot com tells the story of the impeachment of Bill Clinton and it tells much more tells the whole story of Ken stars life\nBut it does not portray Hillary in a very positive way and when you read that book you can understand why she would be so utterly unprepared for questions like those she received on CBS listen\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no no no well I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern today has said you should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think [noise]\nFeel sort of resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with him in terms of power imbalance as to why\nAn adult but let me ask you this\nWhere the investigation of the current incumbent against him numerous allegations have been made and which he dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and as I Believe came out in the right place\nOkay I it came out in the right place for Monica did it uh it came out\nIn the right place for those people by the way including very much Lindsey Graham who was one of the leading Republicans in the house of representatives at that time a working on impeachment\nThis is so astonishing this is a eight utterly shameful display of what about is um\nLet let me play it for you again because he'll notice immediately that rather than talking about what was obviously an abuse of power involving a president of the United states and then in turn an intern in his office\nIs she a dozen confront that and she says oh well but what about Trump but you know what here's the key point and and listen to how\nHow ... Hillary Clinton just he lives that she just moved away from it and doesn't even touch it\nPresident Clinton was accused\nOf miss behavior the kind of behavior that would have gotten any CEO fired and so quickly so quickly you can't work for any corporation I mean anywhere today you can't even work in Hollywood and be involved and doing stuff like this and and come out the other side\nThe accusations about Trump\nHas to do a with a period in his life long before he was directly involved in politics and certainly before\nHe was in the White House by the way a ... just listen one more time and I want to come back to this 'cause it's very very important and it's it's so crucial to make distinctions okay here's Hillary Clinton again being questioned about her record defending bill\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no no no no I take responsibility right where my writing and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern today has said he should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an internal power imbalance why\nAn adult but let me ask you that she wasn't aware of that organization of the current incumbent against him numerous allegations have been made\nOkay stop stop stop right there ... I think anyone including the most devoted supporters of President Trump a would acknowledge that if it came out that he was having an affair with the White House intern if he were doing the things that Bill Clinton we now know did\nThat yes President Trump should step down at but there's no evidence of that and I am virtually certain especially given the amount of media scrutiny of President Trump\nAnd Secret Service scrutiny and and FBI screwed and everything else there's nothing irregular about his sexual behavior since he has been president\nAnd see the point over here is the failure to make distinctions in other words Hillary Clinton and liberals want us to believe that what Brett Kavanaugh did as a Seventeen year old allegedly at a party\nA is a is incredibly serious in ruins him forever and what Bill did as president of the United states and when you talk about abuse of power there's also such a thing about abuse of power involving\nThe Congress and the government and federal investigators or we will get to that and much more coming up on the ... that show\nBob Michel message all across America it's outfitted than have it well I mean it\nLike this is Michael ...\n[noise]\nBelieves that it is significant if you're able to find that if people have taken these DNA tested always turns out oh you know two percent African American and I'm One percent are from from uh Australia aboriginal I I don't think that turns up very often but the the entire thing is not\nThe only Democrats do this it's completely ridiculous why are we so obsessed with DNA but the question here would be was was there any\nSense in which you grew up with a meaningful identity as an Indian and she didn't\nShe was a fraud about it she ought to apologize and just move on I I Do find that embarrassing when the president used the term Pocahontas cause Pocahontas by the way was somebody of real Native American heritage who became a Christian she changed her name to Rebecca and she converted Christianity\nUm look at President Trump was asked about these latest revelations about a senator\nElizabeth Warren who is getting ready to run for president that's why she released this video the timing is horrible for her because I Will only heard Democrats and the forthcoming elections here's what President Trump had to say\n[noise] why\n\nYou've got to read it again I\nWas I think also that I Do not\nAll destroyed the you'll make that being said I don't want to say about\nI feel that that would get the profit off of\nIt is going to be a long process for the Democrats um are there people who are saying uh well President Trump said he would pay a million dollars if a she could prove that she was an Indian now\nAnd there are people saying well he has to pay or a million dollars now cause she proved a that she may have had\nAnd won the Indian ancestor six to ten generations ago sorry\nHere's exactly what President Trump said he said at a rally if I'm debating Warren I'd make or take a DNA test and pay or a million dollars if she can prove she's an Indian [noise]\nNo she can't prove that but I'll tell you one thing you can prove is Elizabeth Warren is one of those Democrats who was threatening to bankrupt and destroy our Medicare system how we'll get to that I'm an right up on the ...\nBy Michael ... ditch all across America this is Michael ... direction [noise]\nFused\nOrdinary but I'm a news drug nine Ninety died um\n[noise] we're sort of news on by Washington\nPresident Trump is backing off his claim that so called climate change is a hoax but he says he doesn't know if it's manmade\nAs a judge the climate will change back again goes according to the president made last but they're going to be with CBS districts they're mostly also stress who does not want to put\nThe U.S could a disadvantage when it comes to responding to climate change is that something could could cross the\nCountry really into the dollars that also empower some of the nation drivers are as President Trump continues criticized Massachusetts democratic ah so it it was warm says she evil tree grows we're headed to the ring and twenty twenty that's about ... showing that you know some Native American blood the president said quote\nWho cares serves as well for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection buckling under its massive debt load\nAnd is staggering wall says on Wall street right now but that was a twenty points that go by thirty five ...\n[noise] he's\nTalked nine out anytime favorite traffic sponsored by compassion international jammed both ways to design three they express way east on the people at south Montgomery to the ... jamming up from university through the ...

for the Republicans who are\nFighting to maintain control of the house of representatives the Senate should be fine that that also could be close but it should be fine and things for the house side are turning around\nAnd one of the reasons is stupid mistakes by people like Senator Elizabeth Warren and a former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media in general\nBut one of the other reasons has to do with the fact that a little bit more and it's one of those people out there beating the drums for Medicare for all\nSo for those of us who actually support Medicare and I do I I Know how important it is too many many many Americans uh who happened to be over the age of sixty five\nAh why is it that the Democrats have always claimed credit for Medicare or now posing such a grave threat to it and nobody better to talk to about that than Daniel see Weber\nThe founder of the association of ensure American citizens a Mac he founded bank in the summer of two thousand seven and then first of all we're over a million members now right for a Mac\nGod Mike ... thanks to you and your show where one point four billion active members right now\nIsn't that terrific I I'm I Love that so talk about why it is that this very appealing slogan a Medicare for all really means Medicare for nobody\nWell exactly and it really is expanding up for Medicare which is the kind of an insurance when they're going to converted to his socialism planned\nAnd here's what I'm Talking about is twenty two million Americans have Medicare Advantage plans those plants this year actually having a decrease in premium because they're operated through independent insurance companies having a decrease in premiums however the Bernie Sanders Medicare for all\nWould eliminate Medicare Advantage plans and replace it with the socialism plan\nTo similar to what happened in Canada and the problem with that is they have rationing for example it takes twenty two week schedule a surgery\nAnd I don't think most Americans like a back by the medical treatment\nI was blessed become the fire chief in Atlanta on that then mayor Shirley Franklin and um ten or twenty months after serving her I was appointed to the United states are much destruction\nOf the ministry of President Bush Iraq Obama and I was there for just under a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta about the honorable America St Marie in two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this is this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success\nHow how is it you ended up whether you are say or terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty wasn't that led to your firing\nWell a a year prior to my termination I had published a book that I had written on my own time and self published for Christian men the book was called who told you that you were neck and just the question that got ask Adam\nIn the garden to eat and ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with Dennis this chapter three birth eleven so\nUh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcoming the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was just spend it ah but the reason why I was terminated lives as a cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purpose for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between a husband and I hardly matrimony and that in his sex outside of that a is a thin and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOK Now let's get this straight you have these opinions which her opinions that literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men in the fire department where you\nAre not at all\nSo it it was it the fact is you self published the book he had and use public funds\nWhat business is it of the city of Atlanta\nFor the mayor of the city council or anybody or what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument for using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city views are and that I can have those you as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city\nOr I had an obligation to check those belief that the door is what one council members fit and the mayor clearly supported that position\nOkay at this point ah\nThis I think most people are listening to us or slapping their forehead something this is just clearly unjust and when people suffering injustice or discrimination\nOr a really an assault against their religious liberties and freedom of conscience who you're going to call not Ghostbusters you call the alliance defending freedom a David Portman attorney for the IDF\nOut what the da da du what did you do or about achieve Cochran this case\nIt was it was quite remarkable when

court men tell us a quickly what's happening with this law\nShe saw the the city argued they were trying to be inclusive believe it or not by firing the chief because they didn't agree with his two so I didn't I didn't quite understand that but we filed a lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is\nA is that we argue that the policy they actually required\nPrior permission so they told the chief afterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the ... in the city allows you to do so we challenge that as being unconstitutional his only prior permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us\nI'm so that the judge ruled in favor of the cheap and now we're going to hit the trial to figure out where the case goes for there and and how much damage as for the chief\nFor Republicans to keep control of the house of representatives of the Senate or the United states we should be able to do that\nAnd uh of the White House in the hands of conservative leadership one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six what's amazing about this\nIs they ask people to uh to determine\nDo you have a great deal of trust and politicians trust and confidence politicians\nDo have a fair amount of trust and confidence in men and women in political lights life or or do you have a low amount of trust in politicians trust has been soaring here's the amazing part\nThe increase it's not only a ten year high it's seven points from a year ago\nAnd Thirteen points from the record low of forty two percent in September two thousand sixteenth okay now what happened right after September two thousand sixteen\nThe election of Donald Trump is president the United states is it appropriate to feel more trust in politicians right now actually I think it is I Do\nWith all of the problems that we have an American politics and all the conflicts we have if you're one of those people who trust politicians not at all or less than ever or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nUm meanwhile I Want to get back to that question but there was a fairly remarkable interview with President Trump on sixty minutes I Know it's not Fox\nThose is on Fox and friends it's not the friendly confines a president from those it when he's going to be interviewed by Lesley Stahl who's interviewed him before and then when he was going on sixty minutes these wind CBS network is not going to get easy questions fast\nBalls or pardon me slow hanging curve balls right over the plate\nHe's going to get some fairly tough questioning and he did so how did the president do or you can\nUh help judge for yourself for those who did not see the sixty minutes interview which was big news last night here was a what I think was a fairly interesting inappropriate question from Leslie stall with the president's answer right at the beginning\nYou are the first president to the United states who never had a political post or for\nWorse never served in the military you come up here and you've been here for almost two years now what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president okay so I always used to say the toughest people or Manhattan real estate guys Embrapa\nNow I say that they could have the political people this is the most deceptive vicious world\nAges and ... is full of lies deceit and deception you make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at\nIn the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do\nWhen you look at taxes you look at regulations you look at um making deals with other countries [noise] nobody's been able to do anything like this actually most people don't even try because\nThey knew that didn't have the ability to do it but\nIt's a very deceptive world okay a\nVery deceptive world\nUm but how does that\nCorrelate with the idea that trust in politicians is that a ten year high I I think it has to do with the fact that most people regardless of which side you're on can feel that it at least\nSome of your concerns\nAre being addressed because there's so many voices in this political debate some mano grammatical\nAnd even though we don't officially have divided government ... the Democrats haven't been shy in letting their points of view be known and by the way the poll from Gallup the show the trust and politicians it a ten year high that was taken before\nThe accusations by Christine Blasey Ford and before the second round of the Kavanaugh hearings and there's no question that those accusations\nTook a toll particularly on confidence people hat and in Brett Kavanaugh though I still believe that uh that entire confrontation is going to work very strongly Republicans\nAs does this general sense that believe it or not with all of the deal making and the viciousness that President Trump is talking about\nA there's a sense that the political system is working\nA President Trump was a\nThen asked about uh\nThe aspect of the political world that he is most routinely condemned and that of course would be as good friends and mainstream media\nBut the other thing I really learned is I never knew how dishonest media was I I I really made it I'm not saying\nThat as a soundbite by now I I never knew how to try to get to know what even the way you ask me a question like about separation that\nWhen I say Obama did it you don't want to talk of that no I don't know why it was ... I got an answer but you did it four times I'm telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject I mean but I don't want to have that fight with you hey are you not if I look at the time I'm president and you're not\nA okay uh\nAnd and then the change continues to a a question that I think a lot of people ask about an editor mocking was used regularly that President mocked Christine Blasey Ford well Lesley Stahl picked up on that and just took it a little bit to the side\nProfessor of philosophy forging mimicked her\nNot made a speech we would not have one I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary why did you have to make fun of her I didn't really make fun of that is the person that we're talking about\nDidn't know the here at the time the plays protests are they forgot before the Senate and was asked what the worst moment and she said when the two boys laughed at me at my expense [laughter] and then I watched him and my car and thousands of people were laughing\nAnd they can do what they I I Will tell you the way now justice Kevin always treated it has become a big factor in the midterms have you seen what's going on with the ... did you have to\nWell I think she was treated with greater respect I nobody on his side what do you think we shouldn't do you think you treated her with prank show ya I I just seem to be saying that she lied about a ... you know what I'm not going to get into it because we won it doesn't matter\nWe won okay a look at the one thing that I think he was on the right track with he did not men make her mimic during her as if you try to imitate her accent or\nTone of voice he didn't do that and that would have been horrible what he did was he talked about the aged and changes tone of voice\nHe said he said uh when did it happen I don't remember where did you go I don't remember if we can have that to play that soundbite for you but this entire media narrative which I don't think is working for the left if you disagree with me and give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nThat President Trump was mocking Christine Blasey Ford that he was mimicking her mimicking is even worse\nBecause people do mimic people I mean I I have been known to mimic people oh Im perfectly sometimes but I Do a better alone and that this was not\nThat and then uh\nThen he was asked a question that has a profound concern to Democrats here's Lesley Stahl\nAt why not they shouldn't do it this is a terrible thing to do it you know if you believe that the Russians interfered in the two thousand sixteen campaign or election I they metal\nBut I think China metal too and I met some ... why don't you have questions metal because I think China medals also and I think frankly I\nHave a problem to diverting the whole Russian Russia but I'm also saying China\nOkay\nHe isn't always many times what is undoubtedly the ... which is Russia interfered in the election and I think what President Trump is saying is a there is no evidence that Russia swayed\nThe election and by the way I think that's true\nOr if you disagree you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] it is shocking [noise]\nThe way that a viscerally solve question the press\nAnd you can understand why he's somewhat reluctant to do these interviews we'll be right back with more what it means for the campaign and why the rise in confidence for politicians one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nThat has wide ranging global interests and we certainly have played a role in toppling of some very evil foreign governments including a foreign government uh in in Chile or under a Salvador Allende\nWhich actually I think we were justified in and taking some role and I know that very controversial but what does that have to do with this in other words if the United states is looking after our own interests uh we we oppose\nRussia's meddling in our election not because it is profoundly wrong in some kind of cosmic sense but because it hurts the United states it's a hostile act and we want to stop it [noise] so what's what's wrong with that\nI don't think there's I don't think there's anything really entirely wrong with us trying to question or own morality in uh in our current role in the world today but just to just to think that there are not governments that are trying to influence our our because we are one of the most powerful countries and\nThen of course there are governments that are trying to do it but uh\nAnd we are we are right to call them out on it and to try to oppose it and then again I think people are right when when a country acts abroad as apparently Saudi Arabia dead which is why do think that what people are talking about about this being some got a rogue operation that went wrong\nThat they were actually they're not to kill his show gay and chop them up into little pieces in Istanbul which they did\nA but to actually just apprehend them and take him back to Saudi\nI I think that is relevant as well and yes there's a difference to appreciate\nYour call I'm President Trump inevitably was asked about the border by Leslie stall there was this interchange\nWhat about the force separation of children from their migrant children from the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same thing it was on the books but he didn't have ... percent un for us to launch that pop the zero tolerance policy\nTo deter families with children and then everybody decided and of course you don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nParents to stay together\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into our country are you gonna go back\nThat well we're lucky that a lot of things really what we want to do is changing immigration laws because they were there were a laughing stock all over the world are you willing though I think you're saying you're it's under consideration all I Want all the laws change\nMy voice is Lesley from coming into our country illegally\nOkay ah I think that President Trump

on this on I'm Sorry I didn't get to our caller in Grand Rapids Michigan I Would have loved to\nBut he was making the point that President Trump did so a mock Christine Blasey Ford\nI don't think he mocked her but I Know he didn't mimic her and that was the word that Leslie stall use you mimic Christine Blasey Ford here's what President Trump actually sounded like a this is before the final vote obviously on judge Kavanaugh and it was a a a comment that he made during a rally in Mississippi listen\nI Wonder do you think it was always wonder\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you

noble Christine Blasey Ford is\nI'll tell you when it's appropriate to challenge it\nCan somebody tell me what good at ... for the country with Anita Hill on Clarence Thomas even though I don't believe she was telling the truth I don't\nAt least you could say she raised awareness of problems of workplace um harassment and even\nBut really what are you trying to accomplish what city here let me read you one of the descriptions\nI'm\nIn Portland which has long seeing clashes between the far left in the far right\nFor two weeks they've been consumed with Brett black lives matter protests over a fatal police shooting in September those protests in turn provoked right wing groups when video emerged last weekend of demonstrators blocking traffic and beating on a passing drivers car and those videos were horrible\nAnd it it's completely what was so amazing as a police didn't break it up these people were attacking motorists and ... and by the way most of the\nMore we're white most of the demonstrators are white and they were as a tank and motorists were being white people\nHate crime okay uh\nPortland police apparently had been expecting trouble and managed to prevent it for half an hour or so by lining up and tactical gear along the street I'm sure they love this but after sundown things kicked off the anti fascist may provoke violence\nAccording to a freelance reporter documented the ensuing Malay on Twitter one of them burned an American flag as a Proud Boys and company we're leaving causing the Proud Boys to return another quote anti fascist ... the entire group with pepper spray\nOkay and then it went down from there I bite my question to folks is what you accomplished with us on either side and do you really want to make the American people hate you is there somebody out\nThere who sees the Proud Boys broiling with the ... people and you think wow those ... people are really brave or go let's hear it from the Proud Boys they've done such a great job\nUh honestly this this is\nThis is the worst of what's going on in America right now is this idea that somehow you express your political point of view or you advance your political point of view by beating on other people\nReally\nLets or go to a your calls to Christie in Plymouth, Minnesota Christie you're on the Michael ...\nI'm ... Hi I was I guess I just well I have to say I was I've been listening to your show and my hackles went up a little bit when you when you said that\nIt was just an attempt to to to block him that's all it was by her her going up there and saying what she said because\nI Know as the timing the timing why why do you think given the fact given the fact that this happens thirty six years ago and that ... has been a very public person for at least Twenty years why now\nThat thing that is exactly what I was going to when I was going to say because\nI don't want this man\nOn the Supreme Court deciding things that have to do with rape cases per se and and laws that that will that will very possibly look at ... ... you know the way that that in law is a is a I\nI ... I don't hold on hold on I don't hold on just helped me logically what does something that he allegedly did when he was Seventeen but he denies and nobody else as he\nDid it it's just her what does her charge against him when he was Seventeen have to do is roe v Wade\nNo it doesn't have anything to do it for all the way what I'm saying is he he's going to be on the Supreme Court which could decide lies bike for all the way that would be influential and two women that's what I was getting at but\nWhen you said too when I don't want to hold on I don't know I don't hold on roe v Wade is first of all it's not a law roe v Wade is a court case and I understand it kindly he has repeatedly answered questions about roe v Wade and he said he considers to be settled\nLaw and I I don't know I don't understand in other words do you think that the fact that\nIf it was somebody else's name wasn't Kavanaugh somebody else who is accused of misbehavior when he's Seventeen years old that should disqualify him from ever serving on the Supreme Court\nAt absolute it's something that if it's something that like for example she he talked about this in her therapy sessions seven years ago\nYeah but he never usually does he do early years after it was it's it's still Thirty years after it happened and Kavanaugh was already famous seven years ago and talking about a year therapy Sessions is very different from writing letters to a congresswoman a Democrat\nTo try to stop the nomination which I think is very clearly when she was trying to do hey I appreciate your call for the we will be

true that President Trump went to Ohio and delivered a rally and the big takeaway from the whole rally was that President Trump does a great big admirer of Robert he ...\nHe I Want to show support for

eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number [noise]\nBill Marr is one of those people and I've known bill for many many years and he's not such an easy person and however I Will say that there's almost nobody better\nThan Bill Maher when it comes to calling out his fellow liberals for their inane absurd and disgusting political correctness\nWhich is one of the reasons that I Believe Republicans will prevail in these upcoming collections Americans are sick of it we covered this study that had been featured a by a Harvard professor\nIn Atlantic magazine a study that shows that Americans cross the spectrum including liberals\nAnd conservatives and moderates and blacks and whites and young and old and the highly educated in the not so highly educated\nEverybody believes that political correctness has a problem in this country eighty percent\nAnd it's ah even higher percentages of Latino people in Asian people people normally skew quote liberal on the political spectrum\nAnd Bill Maher I think understands some of the dangers he said on his show over the weekend this\nPolitical correctness I Believe that would destroy it for them and I believe that now and I think people vote\nNot so much on policy anymore I don't think they followed closely I think they vote on who's strong\nThey know Trump's ... but he looks strong political correctness week eighty percent of this new Atlantic story the for Bush this poll eighty percent of Americans the political correctness as a problem\nAnd I think it's our problem and I don't know why more mainstream liberals don't denounce the political correct is that they must know in private conversations is saying\nOK eight he's entirely correct and there are so many examples about it uh\nAnd and some of the examples or alluded to I think effectively by Bill Maher\nBut there's like ten stories a week let me just go to Scott Kelly you're familiar the Austria okay he treated\nOne of the greatest leaders of modern time sir Winston Churchill said in victory magnanimity I guess those days are over ... where she would apology for the for quoting Churchill because church or a girl or living by the standards of the nineteenth okay let me let me just selfish for this because\nHe said I did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I Will go and educate muscles further on his atrocities fish and the guy who said this from the Nazis and and you know he's a he was a fighter pilot\nMarried to Gabby Giffords was shot and ugly continues on and somebody and people on Twitter and no one denounces his and he has to make an old up when the Trump people go yes you people are too fragile range or all of their government and\nOkay by the way I think Scott Kelly is actually the brother of mark ... Kelly they're both astronauts but not even bill is close enough on that\nAnd ... and we we called attention to the same thing here and they show it how ridiculous I mean the idea that Churchill who ah was an old man even at the time that he took over in Great Britain and Nineteen thirty nine um\nWinston Churchill I actually took over in Nineteen forty a\nThe idea that that that Churchill can't be voted without probation was a that Scott Kelly also offended by uh the reason I'm\nMovie darkest hour which is one of the finer movies of last year or offended by the movie Dunkirk I mean come on it's absurd\nAnd if we really reached the point where Winston Churchill has to have is bussed removed from the White House\nNow it is not true that Brock Obama ordered the bust of Churchill removed it is not true that President Trump ordered the bust\nOf Martin Luther king remote the bust of Churchill had been loaned to the United states by Tony Blair as a gift to President Bush and then they wanted back after President Bush left the White House\nBut ah I suspect that President Trump has put some kind of image of Churchill back in the White House ah meanwhile\nThere was this idiotic response from a Princeton professor named ... junior who's much in the media he's African American he had this to say to this idea that a church all should be absolve of his various crimes listen\nWhat if it was the case that\nThat she didn't realize that the invocation of Winston Churchill wasn't consistent with what the about ... but he didn't know everything about Churchill\nAnd then he realized that Churchill ... really three sanctioned write the starving of Indians and ... and ... he realizes factor Churchill was inside a reunion that we are committed to being turtle project he realized that she did not represented so what I mean by this I'm going to say this really quickly\nFor those who have been caught in the foot of history [laughter]\nYou can't simply in ... the mandate of history as a reason to expect certain ... of course\nComes to me I can I can embrace Abraham Lincoln's\nRight I can embrace view democracy but then I realized that Lincoln held a view that white people no matter what the beer once I understand we can only I think men and boys who own my own terms but I tend not except Lincoln because the west declares him as great I\nHave to accept been like a neighbor to every time I ... I have to apologize to say that all the way\nIt is what he ... he was saying in that moment in other words why not quote Churchill or who basically\nSaid in a a\nA victory Matt and magnanimity and then a A N in ways that in defeat defiance and ... and this is something\nWhere we have to be magnanimous and defiance at the same time we're going to lose this one and by the way what any clown junior is saying about Churchill what he's talking about about Churchill's relationship with India during the war\nGundy ...
