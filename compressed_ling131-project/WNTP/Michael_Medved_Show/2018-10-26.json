I mean I'm ... [noise] I Know somebody is is it okay if I say who it is Greg\n... who ah who has suggested a that any any time the police spot\nA van or a car or any kind of people with more than six bumper stickers they ought to investigate it immediately\nIn any event this uh this is a sort of a tip off to where he was coming from but this is the way Jeff Sessions sounded this morning and and by the way I Hope that this leads to President Trump and all the rest of us\nAppreciating the attorney general a little bit more appropriately here's the attorney general of the United states\nEmployees to participate in this amount that I suspect is in the custody of the FBI I Want to remind everyone to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged to die\nWith fire federal crimes including interstate transportation uh an explosive illegal mailing of explosives\nThreats against former president ... certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers\nFor these charges the defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison these charges may a change or expand as the investigation for foods\nIs law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political by\nOkay good for him a he's he's exactly right and you don't want the president spoke beautifully this morning no I mean it\nAh the Twitter feed probably best ignored but uh his speaking this morning was solid he uh he was speaking to a great group and they were so enthusiastic and he was bonding with him so well it was a moving occasion\nHe was speaking to turning point USA's young black leadership summit and it's it's ironic I just this morning I left a Minneapolis I left the hotel this morning at five\nAnd five AM and I wrote to the airport with my friend and colleague Larry Elder who was on his way to precisely this young black leadership summit\nAnd ah here's what the president's sounded like with the announcement before he began what was a very successful and a fine speech to the people who are attending that summit here's the president the United states\nI'd like to begin or you are leaders that's a real leaders I'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update\nOn the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country band a media organization I Am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody [noise]\nUs we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find the person or persons responsible for these events\n[noise] these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nBut I was struck the authorities to spare no resource are expensive and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice\n[laughter]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever it may be\nOf the law okay a\nGood for you Mr President and then he went on to say this\nMuch never allow political violence to take rooted in America\nAnd I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nI've\nJust concluded a briefing with the department of justice following the apprehension of the suspect I Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service for the department of justice for\nUs attorney's office for the southern district of New York the NYPD at all law enforcement throughout the entire country credible partners these people that worked so hard\nAnd to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done an incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate [noise]\nThe president of the United states and this is a fine moment for President Trump and I know he didn't ah the death associate the DNA on the saliva on the stamps from the packages\nWith this guy personally but he's in charge you know things went wrong you would get blamed\nIt isn't this something worth celebrating and and what is it ... on what basis would you attack the Trump Administration on this issue\nThis it seems to me is a very very good day for America and that means it's a very very good day for the president says well we will be right back with your calls and responses and more about the details of the rest of the bombing scares us back coming up\nTry to get folks on on the left including I I heard earlier today a congresswoman Jackie Speier who was just way over the top and this is a flow reflective of the hatred of President Trump and it's all President Trump has I can you imagine anyone\nCelebrating if one of these bombs going off\nThink about it and for conservatives and I mean we would feel\nHorrible horrible just as I I Know that when ... was shot and almost killed when there was the would be killer and the congressional baseball practice who fired at Republican members of Congress\nI didn't see anybody on the left

I I I Do not believe that there is a would be some kind of conspiratorial Democrats would be willing to sacrifice himself\nOr in order to try to kill some members of his own party ... none of that

exactly the way it happened but you're right there was a situation in California\nWhere there are a bunch of Trump supporters outside of the stadium where he was speaking who were assaulted by demonstrators on the other side and yes this is stupid and there was an attempt I went and culture was supposed to be speaking at University of California\nAre they actually did property damage and they rioted and are there is no question that the left has been far more guilty of actual violence\nTrying to shut down free speech then they're right farm or guilty of it I've never heard of a case in the last stole fifty years of\nPeople in the right shutting down any speaker at a college campus happens all the time from the left appreciate your call or let's go quickly to John in Olympia, Washington John you're on the bed show\nYou know it's it's telling how how you're acting right now because if it had been a Democrat scored or Dole talking has to be this as a false flag and and you mentioned earlier in my mind as you mentioned earlier that Trump spoke and he said he didn't want violent and tear effect to take root in America\nTrump is reaping what he so he he he is doing nothing but a a that this guy was a a a Trump supporter not bar right\nWeight and it needs to be excluding like that Mike and you should be ... warmer saying but it will hold on hold on\nFor a moment at it again you're not saying things that are untrue but you're saying things that are disconnected\nIn other words it as Trump spoken irresponsibly in the past from time to time he does but ... there is no connection at at no point to Trump's ... anything like a I Hope these people die and do you remember what what part of what this reminds me of and I'll I'll tell you I'm reminded of it\nIs this guy on

Gabby Giffords was shot and she ended up being shot by somebody was on the left who was pro marijuana legalization is basically an not but he was on the left\nAnd um and and people try to associate that with Sarah Palin who said that there are certain congressional seats that we should target\nTo pick up and they had put a that none of a picture of Gabby Giffords but over a a map that showed her

referred a couple of times on this show to um [noise] things that President Trump has tweeted that I think are not constructive uh this is a tweet from a couple of days ago before they solve this a crime\nThe series of crimes actually President Trump tweeted a very big part of the anger anger capitalized we see today in our society has caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond\nDescription and\nThen he says mainstream media must clean up its act fast and fast all capitalized with an exclamation point [noise] um [noise] what's my big problem there were just one word which is\nPurposeful purposely falls\nAnd an accurate reporting in other words I this is not to say that there isn't an accurate reporting there is such say there is a biased reporting there is\nBut the idea that it's purposely falls that as part of a conspiracy that\nI honestly journalists don't go into the business and this is true for people on Fox News as to where people on CNN is to have a right and left\nYou don't go into the business of journalism or commentary to get things wrong\nDoesn't help your career it's embarrassing or let's\nAlleged perpetrator has been apprehended he has been interrogated a the proof is accumulating\nAnd the prospect as he will be going away for some forty years but meanwhile the president of the United states\nCharged us earlier today and I think in an appropriate and dignified way with the necessity of people actually coming together and transcending some of the bitterness and viciousness of our politics recently\nAnd I want to speak to you for a few moments or with a friend and somebody who I I'm view is a very significant ally for constitutional causes his name is Michael Ferris\nHe is the president the c._e._o. and general counsel of the alliance defending freedom and uh\nAnd and Mike we were just talking off the air for a moment uh\nI think we agree that one of the essential elements of trying to to reduce\nThe levels of polarization and hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has afflicted American politics\nIs to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of faith and that's exactly what the alliance defending freedom as about we agree with that proposition ones you\nSee the historical American dishes may disagree with everything you say it all depends on the right to say it\nAnd we're losing a left in particular [noise] although there are some in the right to do with the left with the levers of power like in the jak Philips case where they tried to shut down\nChristian Baker who didn't want to use his creative skills to speak a message in favor of same sex weddings\nAnd and the California case that we did in the spring were last year where California tried to force pro life centers to keep a pro abortion message people aren't willing to let people have their own opinions and say them freely\nAt you know can we go to the California case for a moment because all of that very closely and it was extraordinary an extraordinary victory it seems to me for the alliance defending freedom\nOr this was a I've spoken several times for fundraising backwards for um for crisis pregnancy centers and would crisis pregnancy centers tried to do is to give people an alternative\nIn a crisis pregnancies where a very often people are on Mary they have no funds that rather than terminate the pregnancy getting an abortion or that the centers will help you ... the bear the child raising the child and and deal with all the challenges involved\nAnd they were being forced by legislation in California to put up signs that said if you want abortion services [laughter] go go to this address go here go there um and that's about right isn't it\n[laughter] yes I'm I argued the case in the Supreme Court myself and you got it exactly right California's real they brag today in their papers passing a law that this is a part of the progressive vision to ensure that the correct pro abortion message was given everywhere I'm\nIncluding these charitable private crisis pregnancy centers that were set up by donations from people who are pro life\nYeah exactly and so the ... they were not willing to let people have a different opinion on abortion if if if you were on our side of the issue of the other side of course wasn't required the print the Planned Parenthood is through was not affected by this law\nIt was only they claim that they only wanted all women to have a views well that didn't work that way\nRight and then just to get this so people see it so clearly in other words you would have been fine with is is that a Planned Parenthood day and

covered in pro Trump stickers often part\nIn a lot of a local strip mall\nAnd somebody who saw that van who was a documentary film producer and editor\nNamed David ... said it struck me because of the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows it was unsettling and also it seemed to be occupied in other words someone and living there sometimes the door would be a jar or window would be open which indicated to me that maybe someone was living in the event\nOf President Trump has spoken very appropriately he said these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country we must never allow political violence to take root in America he was just outside the White House moments ago and they shouted a question at the president\nWould you yourself pledge Mr President to tone down the rhetoric for the next few days and here's what the president said he said I think I've been toned down if you want to know the truth that is the truth the has been toned down in the last few days but then he added this\nHe said I could really telling it up because as you know the media's been extremely unfair to me into the Republican Party\nUm you know can we play because we should for

otherwise the Democrats are going to take control of the house of representatives\nUh I I don't think it helps to continually go after media and to suggest that they are deliberate\nThe lying and now they get stories wrong all the time they show by us all the time but the idea of deliberately making things up and lying\nThe president tweeted a very big part\nOf the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast\nThey do try to clean up their act when they get things wrong I Am very very often they will apologize I there was an outrageous story early in the Trump Administration I'm sure many of you remember\nWhere they were reporting in time magazine that the president of the United states had ordered the removal of a bust of Martin Luther king that never happened it didn't exist and within four hours after posting that story they apologize and took it down\nAnd it's outrageous that they made the mistake in the first place and there's no excuse for it but at least you respond the same way when you move back\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six I actually believe that politically this thing should buy writes benefit the president of the United

me on your um look hey I I totally understand how it can sound cocky media can sound crazy but the way the world is right now it's I think it's a little bit insulting when we say that things like CNN the fake news\nThat they don't operate from a place of 'em just irrationality sometimes when they called a people like the Southern Poverty Law Center and and there are awarding the antifa members were doing\nA you know where justice work social justice work I mean I've never\nI've never heard CNN describe antifa as doing social justice work and try to describe themselves as social justice warriors and that you tailor their sucks but I've never heard I've never heard CNN or MSNBC or any major mainstream media source say that ... was good guys\nOr at least the the point that I'm trying to make is they're not out clearly making them out to be the bad guy and the people who are the the voice that they have on their network at least hold them to a higher regard and they're not shutting down and and I totally understand that but\nThat doesn't look I think what you're saying is true I think there is profound buyers throughout media news at its it's very very biased and they they certainly treat neo Nazis I'm much more harshly or Proud Boys much\nMore harshly than they train antifa antifa deserves just the same kind of contempt and just the same kind of criticism but that's
