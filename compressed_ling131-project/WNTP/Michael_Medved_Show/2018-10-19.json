with one of the\nProducers we will also be speaking\nAbout I'm a potential presidential matched shrimp that a lot of people are excited about would be a Nikki Haley on the Republican side versus Beto\nO'Rourke on the Democratic side more Beto O'Rourke I mean the the media love affair with this guy is something to\nBehold does he deserve all the hype and then we're going to be speaking to Stephen Moore the author or a new book called Trump's ... about some of the lives about the economy\nAnd what happens next after the November elections to help Trump fulfill his America First vision of economic reform one eight hundred nine five\nFive Seventeen Seventy six our phone number but first up\nLast night the president gave a a a rally speech and he was an extraordinarily good spirits he seemed extremely jolly\nThe one aspect of his speech that has gotten all the attention I don't need to play for you because it's in that CNN and CBS and NBC or all over it\nAnd let me just acknowledge\nI think it was unfortunate I don't think it was a good thing that the president or said that it was a praise worthy or a ... that basically\nCongressman Gianforte Greg Gianforte of Montana he was in ... in Missoula and congressman Gianforte and at the time I thought that John forte handled it very well he lost his temper he body slammed the reporter he knocked off his glasses\nThere were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a legal settlement with the reporter he assaulted and I've spoken to Congressman John forte this was one of the most embarrassing moments with his wife\nAnd I don't think it's a good idea for president from to make light of it I don't think ours when John forte would think that however what struck me about this is this is that that was a tiny segment of a very long and very substantive speech actually will Trump was doing and I think in a fairly effective way\nWas laying out\nThe way he's going to be campaigning and very close Senate races in very close governor's races as a Republican trying to help other Republicans and Trump last night was in Montana where the Senate races become unexpectedly close\nBetween our candidate Rosendale and the incumbent Democrat Jon Tester who pretends because he wants lost a finger in a farming accident\nNo there's no solidarity there was a show that you were talking about it because he was lost a finger in a farming accident he's really a moderate Democrat he's a a good old boy and said he's not he's a big liberal\nAnd a Trump was speaking on behalf of Matt Rosendale and other Montana Republican and he had this to say in defining what this election should be about [noise]\nI Know a lot [noise] of Kavanaugh\nLaw and order and common sense that's what it's gonna be\nIt's going to be an election of those\nOkay hey these talking about the Kavanaugh the caravan and common sense\nAnd I think he threw in off off script the idea of law and order but that's\nGot to find a look in terms of Kavanaugh\nObviously because of the treatment of a justice Kavanaugh that has mobilized lots of Republicans and there are lots of congressional races they are now the official people who do the polling and the ... and things like that see there is a one out of three chance that Republicans hold the house\nIt used to be down to one out of six so right now Republican prospects are surging even in the house of representatives and that's a good thing and part of it is because yes\nWith their response to justice Kavanaugh the Democrats show that they're not the party of jobs they're the party of well we'll let the president delivers on line\nBut the choice would not be more clear Democrats ... Republicans reduced job [noise]\n\nMan see for us [noise]\nThey want to raise your taxes they want to impose socialism on our incredible nation they could Venezuela because that's what's going to have [noise]\nThey want to take away your health care because you won't be able to have in our country will be able to afford it destroy your Second Amendment and throw open your book deadly drugs and vicious gangs because plenty of them are coming across a lot of drugs\nOkay and this is a problem for President Trump because guess what he's president United States Republicans control the Senate in the house they feel the harm of homeland security they control lights\nAnd he is right that there are a lot of people coming across the border I just looked at the numbers and they're sad\nOr the number of people entering the country illegally is not going down and went down the first year of Trump's presidency or the first part of the first year of Trump's presidency\nAnd selling tripled where it was when Trump became president of the rates in September ... the angry\nAnd that's why I think President Trump is absolutely right to make an issue of this caravan and by the way the evidence appears to be as of a half hour ago\nThat there was some progress getting Mexican authorities to move troops to try to block the advance of of what looks to be over four thousand people waiting Honduran flags by the way\nWe're marching their way through Guatemala and then through Mexico and they say they're headed to the United states what do Democrats say we know where Trump stands\nTrump stands on a common sense principle which I honestly who who can disagree you cannot let this caravan in you can feel sorry for these people\nBut if we go ahead and say oh well you march told his way will come and we'll process your your applications for asylum that this will be no end to it\nIt will encourage more and more and more and more and look it's it's a question here not of whether we rearrange our immigration system to make it more sensible maybe even more compassionate\nBut right now the question was this caravan is what do we have an immigration system at all\nOr whether we simply raise the borders any kind of meaningful distinction\nAnd uh I think frankly President Trump is looking at this thing going on how is this going to work out either as he is going to win victory and turn the caravan back\nWhere there's going to be some kind of awful disaster and I think the incoming president of Mexico undress Lopez Manuel Obrador\nUm has a ...\nActually shown some willingness to work with the Trump Administration\nOn stopping this caravan which is crucial I've been a Trump um said this about\nThe economy and related it of course to the fact that there are more and more people coming across the border\nBecause I have such an incredible autonomy I Am so [noise]\n\n[noise]\nOkay [noise] uh probably the\nRhetoric I created so much I have done this either and\nYou know and that's not ideal rhetoric but look the fact is the economy has done better that's what\nWe're going to be talking about with Stephen Moore coming up and and just a moment the point over here and I think it's very striking is everybody knows what Trump says everybody knows where Trump stands everybody knows what Trump has to say about that has anyone heard a any kind of meaningful democratic response on this issue of the caravan\nBecause I've heard nothing all they do is they attack from and that's not a policy being anti Trump is not a policy and last night\nThey don't work the new democratic superstar the great hope for Democrats not just for two thousand Eighteen but for two thousand twenty and beyond ... who's a talented politician but he blew up his his own campaign and frankly I think his own future\nWith a one answer that was just appalling [noise] we'll get to that and to your calls coming up we'll also be speaking with Stephen Moore\nThe author of a new book Trump ... she of course one of the leading economic thinkers at the Heritage Foundation behind the America First economic reform we'll be right back [noise] one\nEight hundred and Ninety five five seven genes Seventy six the Michael mittens your last one eight hundred nine four five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design the those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't it\nYeah and revenues are actually up this year so we passed the biggest tax cut and three years and we actually have a slight increase represent what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nUh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues headed for people to work at ... businesses profitable businesses back to the United states which is happening but you know what the problem is spending and you know people say oh you're just a robbery Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans\nAnd Democrats there for a bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's a idea a vast amount every department at five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do\nYou know that that's the thing if you're running a business and you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agents and that's what businesses did during the recession they\nTalked in their stomach they tighten their belts they got rid of an efficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money they became profitable getting we never do that and government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories\nAnd warehouses and and apartments and that that isn't for structure and what\nWe need pipelines we need a lot of Alan gee terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our porch a lot of that Michael I think can be could be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all this stuff\nI think that's a great ... points for President Trump

just thirty eight million in the last quarter\nHe's broken all kinds of records for fundraising 'cause people are very very inspired by his rhetoric last night he had a tough night very good at answering some questions but there was one question he was asked were the answer's gonna come back and bite him here's the question\nMy question would be a what would you say to Republicans and independents who are watching tonight and are contemplating about voting for you but are worried that should you when your main objective as senator would be to try to impeach President Trump\nOK tough question right because well let's listen to the way that uh the young Mr O'Rourke a Dodgers and waves and refuses to face it here's this direct answer\nI Want to tell everyone in this thing regardless of your party affiliation\nOr any other small difference that does not have to define us at this moment that we can come together I Want to represent all of you it's why I'm here in the Rio

to hear your story one incorporated into our campaign it's the same reason that I go\nTo this question amount in ... by the way he ramble on and on like this for literally about five minutes without even touching the subject of impeachment and Dana Bash who's moderating for CNN\nWhich loves that though says wait a minute lesson kind of\nAnd he\nSaid in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach have you changed your mind\nUm let me let me put it this way\nI'm there may be an open question as to whether the president than the candidate thought to ... with the Russian government in two thousand and six team what the quote George Will very conservative\nColumnist when we saw him on that stage in Helsinki\nDefending ... the head of the country that attacked our democracy in twenty sixteen instead of this country and its citizens and it's amazing democracy was collusion inaction\nThere may have wondered when he fired James Comey the principal investigator and what happened in that election whether that was an attempt to obstruct justice but win by broad daylight on Twitter he asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation always say that obstruction inaction\nOkay goes on and basically what he's saying is yes he would go back to the house of representatives if he if he does go back to the house of representatives a IVs not planning on it he's planning to be elected Senate that won't happen\nOr anything he favors impeachment and I think that's political poison I I think it\nIt means that any moderate who was thinking of voting for Beto O'Rourke because Ted Cruz is very conservative\nOr forget it I ... honestly it at people out there are things that a better workers answering this question effectively look people who love the idea of impeachment they're gonna vote for him anyway\nBut why what is wrong congressman O'Rourke from getting an honest answer and saying look\nJust want to find out the facts\nLet the investigation work right now there is no evidence and there is not that should lead to charges of high crimes and misdemeanors that impeachment but let the investigation work next question\nInstead he goes out and lays out a case for impeachment now it's foolish let's go quickly to Ned August uh Georgia you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Trump's praise of Greg Gianforte body slam was far more than

abortions lied about traveling I Try to destroy\nGreg if we can because Nikki Haley's focus the Al Smith dinner and her humor has gotten a lot of attention but she also sent a serious message\nAnd the message was that\nOne of the things that has to happen in American politics is stopping the idea that if you disagree with somebody over a political issue that person with whom you disagree is necessarily evil\nThat is not true I Do not believe that the Democrats are in general evil\nAnd maybe some but I Can't even think of any off hand who who's an evil Democrat don't call me on your nominations for an evil rather Latino deserve to lose\nActually I Hope that all of them lose this time they want all news because we have a two party system in this country but it's a point about this is it there's a difference between evil and foolishness or even corruption\nAnd here's what a Nikki Haley had to say about this at the Al Smith dinner and she said it so well that well let's just have her say it herself\nWe've had some laugh and I can find at ourselves and\n[laughter] than I really do want to share some things I Believe is important\nI think a lot when I speak to high school students and the kind of like it\nAnd are toxic political environment [noise] I'd heard some people in both parties describe their opponents\nAs enemies are evil\nAnd America\nIn South Sudan or rape is routinely use as a weapon\nIn the area where the dictator uses chemical weapons to murder innocent children that is evil\nAnd North Korea where American student Otto Warmbier was tortured to that\nWas evil in the last ten years I've seen truly evil\nWe have some serious political differences here at home\n[noise] we're left with a political system that allows us to resolve our differences peacefully\nWe must recognize that we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we are United\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that\nAnd particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a\nBb she's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women and\nBy the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that that they don't provide any education for the women\nIn any event she's Christian and uh\nShe has been on death row in two thousand ten what is her crime will here is the other way it's described in the wall Street Journal um it it it turns out that are troubles began and again this is eight years ago\nWith a squabble over a cup of water on a sweltering summer day in Punjab\nTo Muslim women accused ms baby a farm worker and a a mother a mother of five in fact they accused her of polluting the cop that they were all drinking from on this hot day because she drank from it and she's not a Muslim\nSo in the midst of this argument allegedly ms baby told them Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind what did your prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind\nNow it's not even clear she actually said that because under Pakistani law to talk about blasphemy is blasphemy so all you're allowed to do is say she committed blasphemy you're not allowed to\nCross examine the witnesses she's been condemned to death since two thousand ten she lives in a windowless cell there have been international efforts to free her\nAnd um [noise]\nIt's it's just unbelievable they're already people who have died in her case a shortly after the span villagers accused ms Bebe of blasphemy and they had her imprisoned\nThe following year accord censored to death she lives in a windowless cells where she cooks for herself for fear of poisoning by prison staff or a fellow inmates against this backdrop a standing up for his bb requires courage and ... and then two thousand eleven as a year after she was condemned\nThe governor of Punjab governor Solomon tough fear\nOf visited her in prison to try to show some sympathy for her and right after that visit and his expression of support for us see a bb his bodyguard killed him\nTwo months later a gunman killed Shabaab bought the that's another a Christian politician\nWho also opposed Pakistan's blasphemy law it's an unbelievable thing this is a nuclear power\nNow why am I talking about this right now not only because there was attention to her case and there's a new president of Pakistan Imran Khan who says he's a reformer he's a former cricket star\nAnd maybe just maybe he will show some mercy on this poor woman the problem is the president con\nSupports the blasphemy law the idea that someone should be executed for saying something that disagrees with the religious beliefs of Ninety seven percent of Pakistanis\nOr the entire thing is mad and it's difficult and it brings us to this um this democracy Yogi incident I uh I had been troubled by some voices on the right who want to say that to show the\nAt one time and his wife had been sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly moved away from that if you read his last column that he wrote before he died that was just published earlier this week in the Washington Post he was no Islamist he he was calling on Islamic countries to allow more press freedom\nIronically the the idea that anyone would try to justify or minimize the hideous nature of what apparently was done to Mr show he is sad I actually think President Trump and secretary palm pay on particular have been getting it about right\nYou can't go off and say well we support other reforms that Mohammed bin Salman is doing therefore this is okay we have to look past it\nBut you also can say we're going to blow up our entire relationship with Saudi Arabia which is a regional power and as a very important ally the United states over this one episode\nAnd it's it's a remarkably important that we move forward we will form of some unity and not make this into a political issue one of the things that the Democrats do wrong as they want to make every last thing about Trump\nAnd uh I Do I think that Trump made a mistake or comparing well saying that they he should be innocent until proven guilty it's like Brett Kavanaugh comparing\nThe potential murder to the uh legit and I believe imagined a song by a Seventeen year old high school guy who had an end to end it was halted that Coleman aided in groping\nI've to compare that to a brutal murder and December meant and torturing a guy in cutting off his fingers and and then slicing of his body to transport out of the country [noise] this is not comparable\nAnd it's also not comparable because this was done in the name of government I'll tell you what scares me most about the show the story\nIs that stupidity and sometimes more frightening than arrogance or pure evil\nAnd how stupid do you have to be if you were planning to murder some journalists to try to do it in the consulate in a foreign power what\nDo you think is going to happen how can you imagine you're not going to get caught maybe they wanted to get well if they wanted to send a message but that's able to send a message through murder and torture is hideous in as evil and that's wrong\nThese stories the one from Pakistan which is hideous the one from\nSaudi Arabia and or the murder if it occurred and I think it did is actually from turkey they're very alarming but they have\nOne lesson that's profoundly important the lesson is\nProtect religious liberty is absolutely crucial or we

not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skill to this cause but everybody's in a position to give a donation and it's really important because right now\nEven with a much more sympathetic administration in Washington DC\nOr religious liberty is still under assault and it's under a song or by bureaucrats by local officials by school boards in many many different areas and

and the club is about I Would say hey around age twelve\nIs hill about Seventeen or Eighteen and tell pre college they do the diving at UCLA on campus and they use their facilities and the lock around UCLA has a a a gender policy that is very open to everyone there is a transgender\nBoy and on the dive teams that uses the girls locker room and it was very startling when she came out of the stall one day when they were changing it's bathing suit\nAnd which is why she's twelve and I assume he's Nineteen\nYou know so my daughters actually sixteen but at the age range is that the kids are about twelve to about Seventeen or Eighteen I think the boy is all I think the boys all sixteen but the girl that phones before getting into the pool and the sour after\nSo so your your daughter was uncomfortable with is what happened next\nI when they finished diving and and that got out of the water is our he was in their showering girls and so instead of them pulling debating down everyone kept debating it is that an uncomfortable situation spoke with UCLA title nine department and\nI assume he did not see how he did not keep a bathing suit on\nI think he did I did not I think he kept his\nThey okay I I just do the stupidity here it's just so unnecessary so she spoke to the uh people at the diving program and what they say back to her\nWell we did actually at herring because they're free online\nOurs and down they were very very ... they have never experienced it before it this year before and um anyway when they wound up addressing it with the rules for UCLA UCLA than than their guidelines that title nine guidelines which says that they\nUm they allow transgender to go where they identify which is the girl black around and at one of the girls is uncomfortable they will find out about holidays and all the girls\nHad any that very backwards and I don't know if\nYou have said that that's exactly what when you say it's backwards is this is not to say that we should have no compassion are no support for people who have gender identity issues people who are transgender\nGot it and there should be a place for them but that should be a special place for them for people who have gender confusion or gender identity issues or our transgendered or however you want to say it but the idea that that small\nNumber of people should be made completely comfortable at the expense of everybody else\nIs backwards and and again there is a possibility if if this is going to be a serious issue then you have a separate time just shower or a separate time to dress up if if you if your gender identity does not conform\nTo um you were at the moment\nPhysiological identity and the entire thing is madness I'm Sorry you've had to go through this with your daughter I Hope

I had been on aware of this I guess I missed out because I don't know maybe I had a sheltered upbringing or did you know that man's eyes clean X was a thing Greg did you know about men size clinics you're a man's eyes guy and a\nThree and you know no man sized Kleenex for for okay well no man's eyes clinics anymore for anybody I'm Kimberley Clark the parent company Kleenex set it received a consistent increase of complains about the branding firm in size Kleenex\nClean X. men size tissues have been on shelves for the past six years at a statement from the company over that time the brand has always been characterized by a much larger tissue size which is both sauce and strong the company said in their statement\nKimberly Clark and no way suggested being both soft and strong isn't exclusively masculine trade nor do we believe that the men sized branding suggests or endorses gender inequality\nHowever they are dropping men size clean accidents they're not going to be called Kleenex extra large\nDo I believe that this is a tragedy know do I think that this is a raid on our cultural patrimony no\nBut he's a silly and stupid and pathetic and strange to think of a company wasting serious money to respond how many complaints you think they received on the issue of man's ice queen ... how many complaints does it take to get you to change something like that that's been

transgendered issue and we're not going to go there right now I'm another bit of political correctness I Can't believe it I you know dear Abby has continued despite the fact that Abigail Van Buren\nA desire to the column anymore the original dear Abby now as the caller has been taken over by genes Philips who is the daughter of the original dear Abby but she was asked a question about a very complicated elaborate foreign sounding name\nThat someone was considering giving a child and dear Abby said this\nNot only can foreign names be difficult to pronounce and spell but they can also call a child cause a child to be teased on mercifully\nSometimes the name can be problematic word in the English language and one that sounds beautiful and a foreign language can be grating English by the way when I read that I immediately thought of of a problem that some Israeli Americans have\nA very common popular a Hebrew name Israeli name is ... and uh or moron I mean but seriously don't\nAnd the name your daughter or your son moron and not not in in this country and not in this culture they probably better named to choose now the point about this dear Abby thing is all\nHell has broken lose for dear Abby people have claimed that she is affirming white privilege that there is a racial thing\nAnd there's no racial and what she said but of course the New York times\nIs ready to make it racial they have a column that says I'm the heated reaction to the column which has been a staple in American households for decades\nAnd was started by miss Philips mother who use the pen name Abigail Van Buren deceived reaction has inspired a fresh debate about identity acceptance and racism Abby's column\nWas deeply infuriating and also revel a Tory said a a a woman named uh Valerie cower\nAbby is clean to an old America were white is considered the norm and everything else deviant and inferior Musk\nOur added that she and her partner believed it was more important to honor a child's heritage and to connect them to that heritage then for a name to be easy to pronounce\nOkay fine Abby was not suggesting that anyone is just giving advice do I think it's reasonable advice sure do we have very very\nDear friends who have given or their children very difficult names we do absolutely and you get used to it uh and now I'm not talking about you Greg a though Gregg is laughing here can I mention the names of your children\nOkay they named their kids after inanimate objects penny a river and shown us\nBut none of those names or that hard to spell or though I don't know may be probably people there are probably people who spelled penny wrong\nBut not many uh okay that's the point about the point about this it it just seems to me is why is everything about race well because people make it about race they a quote someone named a non\nZero right is he's a writer who writes about socialism and about the evils of capitalism he says is the reality is that a lot of this has to do\nWith names but more with white and is\nThere a lot of complicated names from polish and Russian and Italian and German backgrounds little becomes second nature to Americans\nThe unusual names referred to in the dear Abby column aren't unique in their complexity he said they're unique in their complex and they tend to come from places where people aren't white\nThat is nonsense I I mean I\nI think it's very difficult if ah if somebody they're all kinds of names which could understand would be would be difficult and challenging and by the way my last name is difficult and challenging my father's older brother\nMy uncle mice or his his name was Moshe method and he changed his name to ... more stuff\nAnd that was the way he did business because it was easier for business a dove Hebrew or the Hebrew word for bear is dog and the Russian word for bears meant that\nWe have yet so okay this seems to me inane but then we have we have this and this is a

worried about [noise] and then that Sharron nightly\nIs also concerned about Little Mermaid because he says what kind of woman gives up her voice for a man [noise]\nLead to admit it you know don't cut me off on that I have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think about what happened that little girl that comes from politicians that politicians are going we eagle gods now you know God's now\nIs no gods now is evil but does now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look or Tim the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state Supreme Court\nAh basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen now is the life imprisonment that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults but for people to convict him of murder\nAs adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen you can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this that I think is profoundly wrong but see we we lose the battle Tim if we lose the language and evil loses all of its meaning\nIf you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that the Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nI'm OK you could argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and a threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender that it seems to me is a very different matter\nAnd this is also one of the problems that the people had an and there were people of this nature\nA stolen was evil Hitler was evil so why is it that we sent millions of dollars billions of dollars worth of equipment and support and supplies to Stalin so that he could beat Hitler answer because it was necessary for\nSaving the world and uh there was one danger that
