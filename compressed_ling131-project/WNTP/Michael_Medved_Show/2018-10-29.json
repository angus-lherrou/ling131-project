own language\nAnd you have not to mention terrorists coming across not to mention people with the disease which we sent people back and if they had a serious disease they couldn't enter in the United

mark\nYeah hey mark you know I just wanted to say regarding this whole immigration issue that\nWe're really not going to see any reform or change until we cut this dragging out by its head and that means the American people need to stop and think differently about\nHow the new things are on their home I'm a contractor and Southern California and it is so expensive for me to be compliant and maintain a worker's comp and all the insurance that I Need to go through all the permit process which is get by so many people\nAnd Matthews North Carolina about twelve miles outside of Charlotte [noise]\nThe Matthews police departments that\nAuthorities had the shooting was believed to be an isolated incident\nAnd at the scene had been secured by police thank God for the police and thank God for the police in Pittsburgh and thank God for the work of law enforcement in diffusing those bombs and apprehending the evil bomber and yes he is evil he's not just pathetic\nHe's evil and it's possible to be both of course everybody wonders about what are the political implications of all this I Want to go a little bit deeper than that but we'll get to that too\nAnd I want to talk about what this means about America\nAre we coming apart are we experiencing a total social breakdown something utterly unprecedented and and this is just the worst thing in the world\nNo we're fine we're fine\nOne of the most beautiful things I ever heard I really mean it was the announcement on all the media\nAnd it was based upon a statement by the Anti Defamation league which monitors anti Semitism and anti Semitic incidents they reported that the horrible attack on Pittsburgh and yes it was horrible and was nightmarish was pure evil\nThat that attack was the deadliest single attack against American Jews in the nearly four hundred years that we've lived in North America think about what that means what an indication\nOf how blessed we are how unbelievably fortunate we are with this great country one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number [noise]\nUm [noise] let me let me give you a little bit of personal perspective and I don't usually do this but this is very personal I'm not from Pittsburgh I'm from Philadelphia originally\nBut of course we have friends in Pittsburgh I have war shipped at a congregations not at the tree of life synagogue but congregations in squirrel hill Pennsylvania we have squirrels us as squirrels we we have friends in squirrel hill I'm Stuart squirrels too and in addition to the humans\nBut um [noise] ... is the\nThe attack as devastating as horrible and it's nightmarish but uh I think perspective is a hundred percent necessary and what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a White House press briefing I think this could be her best press briefing today\nAs she made a very important point which is when news of this attack came out the very first thing President Trump did was to condemn\nAnti Semitism extremism hatred bigotry the kind of sickness that led to this attack and the very first thing that many voices\nIn the news media did she said the media in general but if you can generalize many voices very first thing they did was to blame Trump and to blame his rhetoric\nAnd I think that stinks and I think the attempt by some radicals and they are radicals in Pittsburgh to hijack this tragedy saying that the president in the first lady won't be welcome in Pittsburgh\nBecause of their past rhetoric let me make something clear I guarantee you those people who have signed that position they're sixteen thousand of them\nDo not speak for Pittsburgh and they emphatically do not speak for the Jewish people in the United states\nI Am I found out about this\nOn Saturday morning after I walked to synagogue and and what I usually do and I mentioned this before\nOr our son and daughter in law and a almost two year old granddaughter lives not far from our synagogue um I live further away so I Walk the close to three miles and then I stop in\nA with Danny in enriched shell and Julia and maybe for a cup of tea but just to catch up on the week and to actually see this adorable little girl\nAnd this week uh Danny walked with me from his home in the two of us walk together\nTo synagogue and they which has just literally his his houses clubs and when we got there or something strange because\nThere was a guy we know a dear friend actually Christian guy\nWho is a former marine officer a marine aviator I Know you're never a former marine you're always a marine and and Charlie's a marine\nHe's also a world famous honest or opera singer and an end or a instructor and NRA last life member and he was standing in the back of our synagogue again these questions not Jewish\nAnd I came up and bring them hey Charlie what's going on a great to see you and I said you haven't heard I said no what happened he said there were a lot of people killed\nAt a synagogue in Pittsburgh and I just wanted to come out here to help protect my friends\nAnd it was so overwhelmingly\nBeautiful and it's such a demonstration of America\nThat this marine from Nebraska\nWould see fit now as it turns out we also have an armed security guard we also have at least five members of our congregation um and it's religiously because we have a ... enclosure and a rover out at the ... they're packing\nOn there and they're also guys who are life members of the n._r._a. and they're ready\nSo are we now I'm not suggesting that every congregation that countries should do this but this was part of our factor and then part of what happened was that um\nWhen when Danny heard the news he said well maybe I ought to go back home and tell Rochelle not to bring Julia because you know coming to a two year old and if you're expecting some World War three it said come on we'll we'll be fine we're fine\nAnd he said sure and and the baby came and she had a great time she played was a big girls in sort of behind the services and then we had our um our our kid is like our social after the services and everything was fine now there was there was\nOf course there are special prayers and a mention of what had happened in Pittsburgh we didn't yet know the identity of the killer and this is part of of what is so horrible about this is that um\nThat this occurred on on on the Sabbath and it's ironic those we listen to a lot of the show I ended the show on friday by talking about the importance of the Sabbath and how much I was looking forward to the Sabbath and and the value of actually turning off\nA media for one day a week\nAnd it's because of turning off those media that I only found out when I actually arrived in synagogue what had happened\nBut you know ... everybody who's Jewish pays attention to this stuff\nAnd you have in the back of your mind what's going to be necessary I I Know that that um\nTo go if you ever go to synagogue in Mexico and I've gone to services in Mexico city and Los ... which is a a neighborhood was substantial Jewish community in Mexico city they're they have really heavily armed security guards and metal detectors and\nWow but that's that's basically the Mexico such an unsafe\nWell it's not nearly as bad as Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and we'll be talking about the caravan in a moment to\nBut um it it is simply wrong well here's what Howard Simon said Howard find men for years of Newsweek he was commenting on MSNBC and uh this is what he said uh because I think it's it's just dead wrong and we need to answer answer it back here is fine\nAs watches the Jews ... know their own history this was not a Jewish story this was an American story but says in America a story about the fraying of our social fabric and the rise of violence as a way of expressing yourself in this country\nThat we haven't seen the likes of modern times if ever we've have civil wars we've had strife\nBut we've never had this kind of individual violence against groups based on hate the way we're seeing the bubble up now ah and that's my concern and that should be all of our concerns on this ...\nOkay that's ridiculous it is ridiculous the first in modern times and still in some ways most horrifying killing at a place of religious sanctity was the four little\nGirls who were killed in Birmingham and in the Obama administration of course we have this horrible horrible Charleston episode\nAnd then be for countless Ryan stands riots in Tulsa, Oklahoma\nIt killed about three hundred African American people\nLess ten thousand African Americans homeless destroyed thirty five square of life that was Nineteen Twenty one [noise] I have no idea what Mr find minutes talking about\nTo change this is not the edge of destruction or the eve of destruction disagree you can give me a call will listen to Sarah Sanders at our press briefing coming up on them adventure [noise]\nA you notify the authorities because it is clearly a threat and uh they're inter change that also included this\nShe says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWinter down upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nAre expressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who made a now support Donald Trump or they allow hate dispute at certain groups and certain people\nOkay they allow hate to be viewed as certain groups in certain people that that ... he's he's correct there shouldn't be that kind of hatred toward anyone and by the way one of the names that has to be mentioned in this context as Farrah Khan\nWho recently compared a Jews to termites in infestation of past and um look at a Farrakhan for years and years and years has been spewing this anti Semitic garbage and yet he is honored by people on the left\nHe was recently seated in a place of honor two seats away from Bill Clinton former president at a reserve Franklin's funeral and Farrakhan just like this guy Robert Ballard should be stricken from polite ... conversation\nBecause of course ... to to talk about criticism of one group or another group that is free speech but when you go into Nazi tropes and you talked about genocidal conspiracies\nIt's dangerous\nAnd there ought to be some kind of notification or some kind of concern one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\n[noise] the ah the petition by a group\nCalled bending the arc bending the arc add to look it up I'd never heard of such groups cells would be a big Jewish group it's a it's a Jewish group with dozens of member state is not a significant player and the Jewish community they put together this petition saying President Trump shouldn't visit Pittsburgh I Believe he's visiting tomorrow with the first lady and I think that's a good thing\nThe um uh\nThe letter that was signed by the sixteen thousand people says you yourself called the murderer evil but yesterday's violence as the direct combination of your influence\nReally how\nI mean it's it's completely outrageous\nFor the past three years your words

yeah we were there were deplorable or whether it's you know a enemies of the people and the press and it's just\nOn people and frankly among among the press says well\nOkay I I mean he's entirely right the one thing that I Would be careful of Mr Weiss respectfully don't compare Louis Farrakhan that Donald Trump\nI mean Louis Farrakhan is an open unapologetic lifelong anti Semite he is I mean he he he clearly is you don't even apologize for it anymore\nAnd uh he he is identified I don't know anyone who can plausibly say that Louis Farrakhan is not a hater of Jewish people\nAnd Donald Trump is so free of charge you can charge Trump with lots and lots of stuff but I I tweeted about this it is unequivocal that Donald Trump cares deeply about the state of Israel\nAnd as Sarah Huckabee Sanders said today he adores his Jewish grandchildren\nAnd the idea that the Donald Trump is quote dog whistling or as is some kind of deep anti Semite or that he's responsible for encouraging things like this synagogue attack by as ... said a guy who said he hated from\nAnd that's a ... and it's it's the worst kind of political smear and it's totally unfair\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number here was the opening statement at the White House press briefing I'm just about an hour ago from Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nOur nation mourns the loss of these extraordinary Americans and we also pray for those who are willing to our hearts are with the four brave police officers who were shot and injured while trying to stop the attack we thank God for these officers and for every member of law enforcement who responded swiftly and bravely\nIn the wake of the attack we've witnessed Americans of every faith tradition coming together to mourn with their fellow citizens to support one another and to stand in solidarity with America's Jewish community\nThe president cherishes the American Jewish community for everything it stands for and contributes to our country hit doors Jewish Americans as part of his own family [noise] the president is the grandfather of several Jewish grandchildren\nHis daughter is a Jewish American and his son in law's a descendent of Holocaust survivors\nTomorrow the president and first lady will travel to Pennsylvania to express their support of the American people and breathe for the Pittsburgh community\nOkay and that is the right thing to do by the way some props to the NFL or the Pittsburgh Steelers went on with their game and that was the right thing to do and yeah there was some religious Jewish people in the crowd USA Today wrote about them\nAnd there was a sign that I think called the ah the attention of many people\nWishes hatred can't break a city of steel\nAnd by the way the Steelers one up but they were sorry if you if you at the Cleveland Browns so that wasn't a shock uh John ah Jonathan Karl of posed a question to Sarah Sanders about the the president's a legit responsibility on this heart\n... over the weekend that he could tone officers rather or what what does he mean by that let's see if anything's fertile his words\nCode is fire approval for people do awful\nCertainly ah the president wants a enormous for our country is hurting like we've seen 'em in the last several days of find ways to bring our country together and we've seen him do exactly that\nHowever the president is going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties particularly on policy differences you'll continue to see him make that contrast [laughter] ah but he has certainly I think\nFound those moments to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well\nOK and again I it is hard for me to imagine\nThat Sarah could have handled these\nThese questions more effectively than she did Jonathan Karl kept a going at this and about President Trump blaming the media which by the way yeah do I believe he should pull back on that of course it's tired it's stupid stop it\nUh but Jonathan Karl put the question of Sarah\nWhy is the author you say he's training you country why is the author\nVery very first\nThing that the president didn't was condemned the attack soaked in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous accent\nIs outrageous that that would be the very first reaction\nSo many people on top of this country the I'm not finished the only person responsible for carrying out either at these heinous acts were the individuals who carried them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault for the individual who shot up a baseball field of congressional Republicans\nYou can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime\nWas for the rest of the news media is the first one was the one place the blame here the\nPresident seemed wind the president's not it's not responsible for these acts\nThat again the very first actually let the president did was condemn\nAh these heinous acts the very first thing that the media dead was condemned the president and go after and try to place blame not just on the president but everybody that works in this administration\nThe major news networks first public statement what's to blame the president and myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried out the problem would hold that responsibility\nOkay and ... again particularly regarding the synagogue in in Pittsburgh when you talk about trying to divide the country the handful of people from a radical leftist group\nWho are trying to prevent the president's first lady from coming to Pittsburgh\nShould um straighten up and fly right I I mean he's the president of the United states and he's doing the right thing by going there and by the way I'm\nIn his comments are never ideal but it's obvious that his heart his concerns with this thing we we will be right back with more the dual between Sarah and the press and Mike Pence was excellent on this we'll get to that coming up on them in that show [noise]\nIs he's a phony Indian he claims\nTo be a

I Do agree with you when you I've just acknowledge before that I think the president I'm the president can make clear that we are simply going with that we are going to try to defend our border and defend rule of law\nWithout a insulting or or giving groundless charges that there are a Middle Eastern terrorists mixed in with a caravan there apparently or not\nAnd all of that I think it's

speech a throughout the history of this country we've always had\nA vigorous debate and then we settled those debates\nIn the ballot box we don't settle them through extra threats of violence like the pipe bombs that we saw some to the Obamas the Clintons to CNN and others and and we have no tolerance for the kind of anti Semitic violence that rear its ugly head today that there is for the kind of rhetoric\nThat you and the presidents have used though in the president just this morning referred to congresswoman as wacko\nHe's called people low IQ he's called people horse face from athletes to the prime minister of Canada I guess the question here is have you ever asked him to please not use that type of language when referring to other people for the in the case of civil discourse in this country\nEveryone has their own style\nAnd frankly people on both sides of the aisle use strong language\nOr political differences but I just don't think you can connect to threats are acts of violence on\nDon't think the American people connect\nThe American people believe that those who are responsible are are the people that actually conduct these threats\nOkay that's exactly right and that the one reason I'm basically that that I Would hope that the president would not use phrases like horse face or low IQ or\nA ... the basically the Rodney Dangerfield kind of a presidency because I don't think it's politically working anymore if it ever did one once when he was running and Seventeen other Republicans and he could just appeal to his base\nRight now between now and election day it's a question of mobilizing the base it's already mobilized it's a question of enlarging the base\nAnd getting some of the people who may be hesitant about that kind of approach and especially at a time of national tragedy and this is\nRaising the tone of discourse a little bit\nI think it would serve the president and the Republican Party and the country very well\nLet's go to to your calls to

wanna say Satan inspired but it's um it's it's more than normal hey I really think it shows\nA real disappear disregard for God I really believe that\nWell again and I appreciate your uh your your call and your sentiments Frank and of course that relates to genesis twelve three where Abraham is promise of than those who bless his descendants will be blessed and those who curses descendants will be curse\nA the the point about all this\nIs a is it there [noise] the Bible even tells us a with a story of ... which is actually written about by a a ... we just played a clip with him before\nWhere there is something a deeply Neal is steak against God and against all launching\nIn the idea from anyone that he is doing a virtuous hacked to birch burst into a synagogue before the beginnings of

I don't think we should uh think we should have been you know they were responsible for what we should come out that\nOkay I I don't think there's there's any question um ... the coming out and condemning it as the president has done as I think every one of the country has done is appropriate um the ah Britain Hume set out a a strong tweet\nHe said one of Trump's main failings is that he thinks everything is about him one of his critics main failings as they do to their reaction to the hideous events of the last week makes this clearer than ever\nTo put it in perspective a professor Paul ... or lives near Pittsburgh\nAnd his daughter survived this shooting they'll tell us that amazing story coming right up\nMy pillow was now offering a special deal why one get one free to do my pillow doggone use the promos goad Medvedev\nI Do you know what amazes me about this poll is that is it's very much fits in with a I've gone back and looked at every deadly attack on a Jewish target in the United states\nSince Nineteen Seventy seven or so for the last forty years and ... ... there aren't that many of them\nAnd uh but most of the people who died in those attacks\nWere a Christian people who are caught in the crossfire or or even in the crossfire because mostly no one was firing back they were Christian people who were in some cases just wrongly targeted there was a a a beautiful guy very devout a Christian and the son of a minister\nWho in April thirteenth two thousand fourteen he was killed by an anti Semite who was attacking the Jewish community center he just brought his grandson there\nAnd the grandson was killed two for a singing audition they were doing a program that the Jewish community center\nYeah well that's precisely what were we were worried about was them getting caught in the crossfire also to Michael I immediately thought of it because at first we didn't know who is doing the shooting right and so I thought okay what's the date\nOctober twenty seven twenty eight in the day before on friday and my Middle East politics classic grow City College we just finished teaching the Yom Kippur war of Nineteen Seventy three\nWhich it ended I think almost forty five years ago that day on Saturday So I I immediately thought to myself I Wonder if this is a a radical she hottest attack and unfortunately it wasn't\nHad not had nothing to do with that but that this was just some loan wacko ... a Nazi apparently\nA who and I and and the worst thing about something like this is I don't know what you could even do to stop it other than\nBetter surveillance possibly I don't know who would do the surveillance I Would say this people listening if you know somebody on Facebook or in social media who's posting vile hateful things like this and who's bragging about his weapons collection\nAnd and who's talking about maybe going down to the to the whatever synagogue to to beat up some juice it can get on the phone and just call the police\nAnd I I looked at is that at least you can do that that is\nVery solid advice indeed we will be right back with public anger I Want to get too We're in a political season we're eight days before a faithful election [noise]\nI I Wonder if Paul can help explain what the\nHeck is going wrong in Pennsylvania for Republicans we'll be right back with that with professor policy anger over the city college right near Pittsburgh coming right in front of me that show\nMichael ...
