{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "Oh gosh yeah look the party the Democratic party has been completely taken over by the not class\nAnd the more extreme it you know what when Maxine Waters who's been back venture entire life is kind of a mainstream Democrat you know they got serious problems and the irony is that with all of sexual misconduct cases most of them are Democrats you got Keith Ellison who still running for attorney general lives and mental Cherry Hill Democrat\nThis is why you do when I have some conservatives talk about the ... it's all a conspiracy and so I Am against or conservative and they said it a few victims there but when you look because the Democrats are largely in power with a public broadcasting in public radio and CBS and ABC until they're\n... whether it's Charlie would look at the whole Johnny rose right yeah and you probably have Ninety five percent of the other people have lost their jobs or been demoted law are for urban kicked out\nAre liberal Democrats there because they were in power just like Sacramento here in California for those who would actually could be the same in your state capital if you have a capital where the Democrats are in control than the sexual harassment going to be mainly\nDemocrats well not only that we lost free hardworking Democrats for those very charges I was in jail for another reason as well as in ... for the Democrats keep getting in trouble\nAnd you know let me say this is going to surprise a lot of people there are a ... well I Can't stand Al Franken the personally it is in his politics there he probably shouldn't have left the Senate because he was groping some woman's behind now I'm not saying what he did was right or whatever the ups but but if they want to have that standard fine because let's decapitated a whole bunch of Democrats there at that threshold there so that\nGets to my point in everybody's part what happens to the presumption of innocence will this road they've gone down\nWell not so I just this whole process you if you had true traditional liberals and civil libertarians over the years there\nIncluding Democrats were to come forward said you know there's a reason why we have limitations this evening is even prosecutorial now in in Maryland there and it's from the high school and I was at a Senator Feinstein was it was a person of of the principal she would have dismissed this thing and said I Can't ... you were saying something happened in high school\nAnd and you know what what do we have nowadays just\nEverything is considered the same level as rape or a you know and and but it's you know you you have a a a workplace where somebody calls but somebody in her hair or whatever and just makes it an unwelcome workplace so we in effect had the effect of trivialize the\nThe real serious stuff of rape and all these are putting everything on the same class what about Senator Feinstein that this is the way she wants to go out and the end of her career and and all her so well remembered how she got in in Nineteen Ninety two she was elected alone with Barbara Boxer the so called year you're the one woman there were boxer defeated who served as to re examine Bruce surgeons in her dear old friend of mine there\nAnd Sean mentioned Feinstein was seen as modern only by comparison to our colleague Barbara Boxer all your national leaders of the national scene\nThese two people directly boxer was most pernicious are there and so uh you know Senator Feinstein should be ... ... were were retiring she's saying I remember just six year term or are there and so these people just never want to leave the national stage that Sean I wanted\nTo ask both of you will Kavanaugh yet be confirmed away agree now I mean not not no doubt Ninety eight percent sure uh and and that's been largely depending what called the FBI finds look there's another finding too I welcome the FBI or a asking people questions on their own one big reason most people that are going to be asking her accusers\nAnd if the accusers lied to the FBI centered Bradley and Lindsey Graham of both said they need to be prosecuted and I think I think for herself was going to be under serious scrutiny when she has a statement of the day she has makes great inconsistencies under the suggests strongly that a U.S federal prosecutors actually ... anybody\nOn one thing your listeners may not realize when they hear the ... century FBI stuck with the way an FBI close worked at that level you fill out a form I forget the number of cars I filled out and I've been sitting there at three hundred dollars you know it but yeah and you fill out the form\nAnd you lift people suppose I listed Sean steals a friend of mine there which I Would have the bad judgment of doing to me it would they would call him about it but then they go to Sean and he says all these nice things about me and then they say well you know anybody else who does a A R ... well I Know Sam and they take then they go to those people and they say some nice things about me\nAnd they say well gee you know anybody else and they keep going till they finally find somebody who is this something negative I still had six FBI clearances where they've gone to this redundancy all these levels there and still did come up with something there he's probably in ... in good

I'd I'd get a book reviewer Nelly book review and that's a really a great story what's happening in our lives in the last forty years you need to read whiplash\nAnd have to say on the doors but I have a lot of nice doors from Dennis Prager\nThat's terrific and uh I think our callers have been uplifted by you guys what are your final thoughts because there is hope you ... you know in terms of what's going to happen Kevin I was going to probably get confirmation said Ninety five percent sure uh people are really upset but they got to go out and vote\nFor Dana Rohrabacher has got to get re elected because the cabinet and I think that uh oddly enough a lot of folks in that community are really upset and that's that should translate throughout the country\nYeah and in fact I haven't the Democrats picked up a few California seats that figuring that'll get them into the house\nDo absolutely and again I think everybody listening should understand that a few seats literally could make the difference it's possible that one party could end up controlling the house by two or three seats are unbelievable any really as possible any final thoughts [noise]\nI hear on my own radio station and DFW and you could say we talked to some capping off so let me share with you some of the discussions I've already had with people than my goal is to have further\nDiscussions with you one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you know the number one eight hundred nine five five one seven seven six go ahead and get in line now you might as well\nI have a feeling it's going to be a a a a hot an active three hours\nBecause and ever since a sort of the middle of the talk show day friday\nOr all kinds of things have busted out and we need to talk about all of them so why don't we take them in sort of chronological order and uh and I have questions for you and uh just let's just share thoughts and see where we all are because this this is not just\nA confirmation hearing any more [laughter] this is not just a battle like the ones we've had in the past contentious things like that though the slander of Robert Bork by Ted Kennedy in Nineteen eighty seven be at the battle for Clarence Thomas or just a short period of time there after that was of course acceptable [noise]\nUh but when the Supreme Court is a very very big deal in the battles over it or a big deal and the moment Brett Kavanaugh was named as President Trump's election I knew I was in ... in support of his nomination because I Want constitutional is on the high court of\nI but I was thrilled to have Gorsuch that was a replacement\nFor the late Antonin Scalia a V. Anthony Kennedy vacancy ... was a kind of a fifty fifty Justice Kennedy a lot of rulings are\nCame down on what side of the bed he woke up on and and he's been replaced by solid constitutions list which is a a a wonderful thing and and now we have a situation in which ah\nWith with with Kavanaugh here comes another constitution list and there is no\nWay in the world there there is no way that the today's left is going to allow a another\nConstitutional list I'm On the court for a lot of people said they didn't get this bad for Gorsuch Gorsuch somehow made it in what seems like a walk on the beach now compared to today's standards and and\nThat because they'll give you one\nYou know there is that old precepts that when you win that election you've you've heard this a million times elections have consequences right and they do that's why bronco blurred knows Brock Obama's election consequences and one of those consequences or Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\nOn on the Supreme Court two constitutions shaping judicial tyrants because that's what you're going to get when Democrats main people at the Supreme Court but but it was Lindsey Graham said in that magnificent Thursday or\nA moment of his it said that as as as he said as the Democrats that is as soon as he said to uh\nTo judge Kavanaugh when you get on the court when you see something you sort of minor ... can you tell them Lindsay said hello because I voted for them and I would never do that and what these people are trying to do for you I still wonder William to four days\nLater after that Lindsey Graham moment I I've I rarely them as a\nI may have leapt to my feet sharing I'm Glad I wasn't driving because I it was it was so magnificent it brought such moral clarity and moral clarity is what we need moving forward in this crazy week this crazy week\nA week may necessary by Jeff Flake and we're going to talk about him and met and in fact we're going to hear from him in a minute because he is at some\nEvent in Boston some radio station is doing something and he was just a it in one and they have an interviewer was asking him a bunch of things and since you know Jeff Flake runs the world now I guess we better probably\nYou know figure out what to what ... says in believe these days but the moral necessity of this is something that I Am addressing in a town hall dot com column that uh the rub tomorrow and that is that this is not just a a Supreme Court\nBattle anymore this this is not just a victory that we should seek a because we wanted constitutional list on the Supreme Court this is\nA moral assassinate because it's not just about him reaching the court anymore these kind of tactics these kinds of things that you've seen these these ... speckled\nBottom feeding tactics by today's left from actual senators to cartoonist stew column writers to two pundits to people to all walks of left his life\nAnd they can't they simply cannot win they simply can not when they have dashed against the rocks the basic precepts of jurisprudence and not even\nJurisprudence thinking about a couple of concepts innocent until proven guilty not just on a federal law school precepts that's not something that's just a courtroom ideal innocent until proven guilty he's a basic\nHuman decency it's what you afford anybody who's accused of anything same thing with requiring\nEvidence an allegation is made well what's the evidence that's the first question you don't accept an allegation on face value this believe women saying it is a scam\nIt in his political bullying Jeff Flake was bullied in that elevator and and and folded like a skinny seventh grader on the playground\nAnd and we're now in this needless week of FBI probe what's\nThe latest hang on the White House has authorized the FBI to expand its investigation interviewing anybody it seems to edit it deems necessary\nAs long as the review is finished by the end of the way oh did you hear any bugs today that the FBI I don't know what kind of we could just go out on their ... imagine that an FBI lake but there was buzz earlier today that the FBI it might be ready to wrap this up like tomorrow\n[noise] okay whenever you got till friday you got till friday that is what ... told us a last friday as you know although you can have my vote you'll have it in committee but you can only have it in the full Senate ah\nAfter a week of a further probes and and look the best case scenario\nThe best case scenario is that this week gives a frozen Boehner to the Democrats who had demanded it creates a comfort zone\nTo ideologically vague to people like Jeff Flake\nProvides a year I Will say cover ... provide comfort of for the Republican votes of Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski\nAnd maybe here's where cover comes in and maybe provide cover for some Democrats who I think we want to vote for Kavanaugh I think they want to not because they like him anymore than Cory Booker does but because they really need to wind\nUp\nAs you know there are dead you know Democrats famously running\nIn states that Trump won and won big Joe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and these are people they don't just want to vote for judge they probably don't want to vote for judge Kavanaugh but they need to vote for judge Kavanaugh because I'll tell you right now\nIs Joe Manchin vote for judge Kavanaugh he takes a big bite out of Patrick Morsi's attack on him Patrick Morsi is the west Virginia attorney general he's a magnificent man\nI think he's gonna win and that and that that would be fantastic that would just be a wonderful thing to Patrick Morrisey the senator from West Virginia instead of Joe Manchin and I like Joe ... Joe Manchin is one of those Democrats who does not make your teeth sketch\nHe's a left of center you know big labor but socially conservative sort of kind of sometimes West Virginia guy and I know that territory very well as the first place I ever worked in radio back forty some years ago\nAnd and loved it then love it now I'm a lot of it so much that I Want but I have a conservative centered [laughter] so let's so let's go Patrick Morrisey and\nPatrick Morrisey as blood joining Joe manager right now I like ... him to vote for a for Kevin which mansion may do\nAnd this week of FBI\nFoolishness may may give them cover and so if we get to the end of this week and the deck is cleared\nAnd the non sentences and this is all this all played out and we have a successful full Senate vote on Kavanaugh is confirmed it will have all been worth it right it will have all been\nWorth it but first one you've got to get there first of all that but I just said had to actually happen and it may not\nIt really may not have you met today's left have you seen these people have you seen what they do have you heard what they do\nThey will move heaven and earth to prevent this not not just the best nomination their goal is to stretch this to the election win back the house so they can impeach Trump and when the Senate so that even if he they they don't impeach him which they won't\nAh he'll never get another nominee on the court [noise]\n'cause when you boil it all down is all about making sure that they're sacrament of abortion\nIs untouched that's what this whole thing has always been about you know that right if not I'll help you out with that so um some of the lowest things have happened over the last few days I'm gonna share the money because my my thought is some folks may overplay their hand Mark Davis in for my comment that happy Monday\nIs Jeff ... job and I and and by the way I'm not trying to turn him into Ted Cruz her turn them and to me this is what a responsible\nJeff Flake ought to have done that occasion\nMa'am I I Am so sorry for anything that happened to you and I honor your experience and I'm open to your experience and you have every prayer and every good wish for healing and ... that's all I have to say about your experience your victimization I of exactly the the proper deference that anybody should have for that\nHowever when you identified judge Kavanaugh as someone who sexually assaulted someone that is simply not been born out in the fact it may in some investigation may play up next week but it hasn't been yet my decision my vote needs to be based on what the evidence shows\nAnd what testimony reveals and not based on anything anybody tells me the matter how passionate they may be about something that might have happened unrelated in their lives\nNow please get out of the elevator I gotta go [laughter] that's how it should go on but it didn't sense now we have this week of hell but wait a minute on that wait a minute on that\nWhat is this week going to do when you're together today and tomorrow I'm enormously grateful to once again the talk show God's you're smiling a Michael's back Wednesday Thursday Friday of course and then moving on I'm from ...\nBy the time we get Wednesday Thursday Friday I mean it was friday being the supposed a deadline for this entire FBI dog and pony show\nI I think there's a possibility here because as bleak as it may look and as a twist it off as I Am about a ... doing during this week you realize we are talking about today's left right we are talking about today's Democratic Party right\nI I think the air hangs thick with possibilities that they make overplay their hand so profoundly\nThey may reveal such a deep bug guide hatred in the things they say and I do and I'm the I'm Talking about cartoonist columnist and the United states senators and everybody in between\nThat the pendulum of empathy may swing toward judge Kavanaugh as millions of Americans just a good grief enough enough this man has suffered enough then there is still no evidence\nOf the type of wrongdoing that originally created this problem for him I think by friday that may be the landscape I pray that it is\nOkay for me I'm earning let's let's have we will talk back to one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Mark Davis and for Michael my bed Saudi on Twitter at Mark Davis M.

October Mark Davis in from Michael welcome welcome welcome\n[laughter] so there is a it's been a busy busy day like made me a date it's not but President Trump had a big news conference a that was mostly about trade issues and this is funny ... baby we can wage this in today maybe tomorrow a\nBecause as a conservative I'm sketchy on tariffs is they're not my favorite thing but I get you there is no arguing with the results sometime it's just these countries are falling into line as as as President Trump tosses out all these sharp elbows\nNext thing you know here we are signing a big old deal with Canada and Mexico as the rest of the trillions of dollars it it it seems tremendous so there there was a lot of of Trump audio this morning here was one of my favorite parts\nAnd he was talking about Kavanaugh and talking about past alcohol use something he knows by his own admission nothing about so play this and then I have a question afterward go\nSays he didn't lie to his drinking does that mean you'll pull him I don't think he did\nHere's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I\nCan honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good traits I don't [laughter]\nLooking for something that I had never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I guess you know for whatever reason\nCan you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I'd be I'd be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing\nPray not I certainly hope with every fervent bone in my body that I Hope that's not the case and uh and maybe this is cause for some optimism because at it and it sounds it sounds\nMaybe a little snarky and I don't mean it too\nBecause I think their recent events that the kind of backup what I'm about to say and that is that today's left today's Democratic Party may overplay its hand so clumsy silly\n... by the time we get to friday a whole lot of Americans and maybe more than a few senators are just going to be saying enough\nIs enough there's nothing new here\nWe've had the entire week the FBI probe that everybody was raining us to do okay we did it are you happy now\nThe answer of course for many will be no of course they're not going to be happy now some people will never be happy because you know exactly what the gain is delay delay delay attack attack\nAttack a lot of people who said we just want a week just take it to friday and next week are going to be the exact same people\nAre then going to say what's not enough it is an artificial deadline I mean why in the world where we are just trying to get to the bottom of the fire people afraid of the truth oh my gosh you'll hear all of that garbage you'll hear all of that nonsense and so just hopefully and Lindsey Graham and the court I played last hour\nAs said look at it I think he might have heard some of what I heard a little bit of bugs it's not that the FBI might be about rapidly so they they\nA nice full weekend how long does it take to talk to five or six people\nHow old is your tank you know I mean how many questions you have to ask\nSo ah the ... when the FBI is going to ah to to make its findings known I I Will tell you I Am comfortable asserting that I have no expectation of additional damaging information\nVis very FBI has looked into a judge Kavanaugh's six times this is time number seven\nAnd so what's the likelihood that oh my gosh is a gang rape is what how did we miss that I don't think that's going to happen\n[noise] real quick you host a talk show you'd take calls and then there's a little tape loop in your head that sometimes rolls\nOf a previous call I Want to go back to a gentleman\nUh it was a very uh it was it was an invigorating phone call gentleman from Columbus and I thank him for his call his main points were Republicans don't want the truth Kavanaugh's a liar a it's all terrible and you know it did where we're just trying to get the bottom of this and it to the destruction gained going on and or or a cover up going on blah blah blah\nSo I asked him several times what is the evidence what is the evidence that a doctor Ford is telling the truth what is the as ... and saw that pesky evidence that\nThe doctor for this properly identified judge Kavanaugh as so has her attacker\nGentleman replied with a sentence that began will judge Kavanaugh is lying dot dot dot and said well we'll know so that that's re stating your premise you're not telling me the evidence that he's lying you're telling me that you think he is alive I Want to get the gentleman over the benefit of the doubt I think the idea of where you might have been going\nAnd this is a concept that I I think it's going to be heavily played this uh this week I think the gentleman's the end of his sentence would have been that he's lying about some things so maybe lying about others okay a\nConcept in law the juries are free if you find that that a witness if you find that a witness has indeed factually lied about one thing you may then cast whatever amount of debt you are on everything else that witnesses said oh that could be interesting so perhaps the gentleman's point I Want to\nGet I Want to give him full shrift ah is that he found judge Kavanaugh not believable on some\nOther things and that struck him as evidence that he's lying about everything\nThat that's far from a from a gracious interpretation but it if if it ... but it's something that the gentleman his is entitled to however here's the thing he is not caught judge capital in a lie about anything and nobody will\nNo one will that precept only applies if you find that someone absolutely proven ... has lied about something that we have now\nIs judge Kavanaugh talking about some drinking episodes and there's some people from his past ago where we might be under playing the drinking episodes usually it was getting a little harder than he led on and then there's all this year book code language of you know the Renato on this or a loved me us as they said it was also learn to your book a\n... a triangle and booze and this and that that's so stupid but here's the thing\nAre in their ... and everybody started Google and stuff is what do you do lose the truth about that rule I think he might be soft peddling that we're never going to know okay\nWe will never not this week or any wake ... ever learn the judge Kavanaugh was factually misrepresenting anything about his way word moments at Georgetown Prep\nAs such there will not arise any basis for that legal precept of if we caught July and I'm On a and B you might have been lying about the Indy\nSo with that are in a moment a boy veto the United states to be in the Senate gallery today because there's red hot Senate action actually there's not really actually there's red hot Senate talking [laughter]\nThere's no real action we're waiting for action we're trying to take action we thought we were going to take action but no Jeff Flake sort of that he took action ... got a closet and and took action to bring the whole thing to a grinding halt thanks guys [noise]\nUm but but Chuck Schumer refers to some of exactly what I'm Talking about there but now they're moving the goalposts\nAnd it is not that there's any evidence that judge Kavanaugh\nIs is a horrible cereal sex criminal but rather they're going after and going after his credibility on other stuff and you'll hear a Senator Schumer attempt that in a moment [noise] the one thing I said I wanted to share as the last hour of the evaporated was this amazing quote\nFrom a woman named Elizabeth last us I think we have rich Lowry the tank over National Review it is an excerpt from a book that she wrote called witness\nFor the defense or she is an expert in psychology law human memory eyewitness testimony I saw another article tweeted somebody in the New York times and like the year two thousand or\nI'll find it if if I Need to ah ... it was just a very compelling eating a essay written by a woman\nWho was raped I guess some time prior to two\nThousand 'cause she wrote it in two thousand and she said I I but there was a lineup identified my attacker I was one hundred percent certain that that was my attacker\nAnd I was mistaken and her courage you're talking about courage that takes courage to admit having blown that call [noise] but as\nMorally necessary to shore and uh and and you know what else is morally and intellectually necessary for us to recognize\nThat this can happen to anybody\nTo anybody even Dr Ford so here is the excerpt from Elizabeth Loftis in her book witness for the defense for\nHow can we disbelieve the sworn testimony of eyewitnesses to a crime when the witnesses are absolutely convinced that they are telling the truth why after all ... they lie\nBut there's the word lie that's the word that gets us off the track you see eye witnesses who point a finger at innocent defendants are not liars\nFor they genuinely believe and the truth of their testimony the face that they see before them is the face of the attacker the face of innocence has become the face of guilt that's the frightening part truly horrifying idea that our memories can be changed\nInextricably altered and what we think we know what we believe with all our hearts is not necessarily\nThe truth man that's a paragraph that is a paragraph from Elizabeth loft us in her book witness for the defense the woman with expertise and\nPsychology law eyewitness testimony human memory things like that I never ever ever actively believed that this entire thing was a trick so dirty debate find a woman who would under oath make up stuff and intense and only ... I never believed that\nAnd as I watched a doctor forge testimony on Thursday morning [noise] she you know let's let's go let's go to the\nDictionary on another word she seemed to what's the word everybody uses credible\nBorders credible means it may it may it it ... it ... what does it mean it means somebody who's eating believable seems unbelievable yeah but it means more than that and we'll examine and take some more of your calls and looks more audio of this busy busy day Mark Davis in from Michael Mann stick around\nMe I I guess I mean uh I mean this is Saturday Saturdays this week ... I'll be friday as this week this work week you know [laughter] so do do do tease me much don't tease me [noise] so uh is when will this FBI\nThing wrap up I don't know so that's a that's continued to uh take a look at your thoughts as we had to Los Angeles Robert Mark Davis in for Michael how are you sir\nYourself a great\nJob you stay room just now that there's no evidence that just kind of an allied allied several colleges in in in that area kept fading about what sport the witnesses said it didn't happen that's not what they said they said they're going to remember\nA ...\nTo okay Dr Ford's allegations quote from judge Kavanaugh are not merely uncorroborated their refuted by the very people she says we're there you would have I guess what someone was is that there are no I don't understand I I and I understand completely and judge Kavanaugh pointed out the various people who have no memory of having been there\nAnd the heat suggest that the refugee ... aims\nIll that's not what he said he said\nAll the witnesses stated it they don't have to go back and look at his death but little says\nThat that I'm ... I'm looking at the court right now and to quote from Dr from judge Kavanaugh Dr forwards allegations are not merely uncorroborated it's refuted by the very people she says we're there and we can have a semantics game all day and semantics is important it's the meaning of words it's not as many as are people\nI I saw the entire jury I hear I Do know\nTied into ... so I tell you well let's do let let's go beyond the refutation or the no memory et cetera is this a true statement not one person backs her story not one person agrees with her story OK\nCorrect that it's not that they are Greek they don't agree\nIs not not one person did not one person who supports their story it's not one person agrees with her story or corroborate her story is that correct\nWhy you know I wouldn't I wouldn't our business do no I'm Sorry who did I must have been something who do who did corroborate her story who didn't I'm Sorry I missed that one\nNo one confirmed what he said but if I Want I don't remember them I'm not real because I don't remember\nWell you are actually disagree near your your your your your on saying that I can prove Eliseo was never there are all any ... any witness can really do is say I have no memory of that because I tell you what generally speaking a witness on the on the on the chair says listen I was not there than some of the some stupid Polaroid picture you'll be in trouble for the rest of your life\nThere is no car operation that's what's important there is no ... let's get this thing wrapped up and vote on this man and do so soon Mark Davis into

rational human being if she says something and let's say she is saying it about a public figure and nobody else can corroborated in any way shape or form I mean I might\nVery well just defer to her because I Love her and it's my job to support her an honor her but I could not\nBlame the world if the world remain skeptical because the world must require evidence this is not allowed to religion is not about whether Russell Ford believes Dr Ford is about whether we all can and without evidence we can not\nWell that that's your opinion\nAnd in August the ... that's ... that's ... that's ... that's called the way life has to me that's the way life has to be we cannot believe people we cannot invest in people's stories with no evidence we can't\nYou know that right we can't that's a crazy

deep uh how how does how do you spend the weekend how did last week strike you and where do you see this drama right now Monday October first\nI was so angry last week the way that Senate Democrats sacrificed doctor for its confidentiality the way they abuse the approval process where instead of allowing a confidential vetting they deliberately put out this letter afterwards I was furious\nSo I went home and enjoy my anniversary and didn't think about it at all\nIf you are a smart man you're a good senator and a very smart man and it was probably a very mentally healthy thing to do good for your health and good for the marriage so now we're all a oh how many years may\nI ask twenty nine well congratulations\nTo both of you that's for happy wife happy life is good for user so now we're back at it and I've been listening to from Chuck Schumer to Mitch McConnell to John Cornyn whoever comes after him and it seems like we're all just sort of biding time waiting to see what the FBI finds what do you think they're going to find\nI think they're going to find exactly what has already been found that Dr Ford made obviously ... Dr Ford had some terrible experience and she has made allegations but all for people who she says should know about it do not know about it she has a backup statement well they weren't really involved so maybe they didn't know about it\nBut at some point in our system of life not just government not just law but life\nIs for people say something didn't happen to one person says did you go with the four particularly when a man told reputation is on line or a woman's reputation or anybody's reputation it's not about male female it's about fairness and for people said it didn't happen when she said should know that it did\nAh you just got to go with the four and so I think they'll\nBe out there and and I think there'll be a vote for Kavanaugh and I think you'll be approved\nCenter a Bill Cassidy whether it's a great state of Louisiana is there any inside buzz in the hallways about what the heck happened in that tight space with that with Jeff Flake and Chris Coons as they walked out of the hearing room the other day\nNo I don't know that um I in fact I Know they're on sixty minutes last night but I just saw them and I didn't look at it um you know I saw on the screen it was muted neither non muted or because the reality is is that for people said it didn't happen and there were the four people alleged to be witnesses and by the way\nBy the way it's like it's like having a live to live in such a sterling character\nUm that that doesn't fit a pattern either and and the Dems are trying to come up with things that would suggest there is a pattern of wrongdoing but frankly none of when Michael ... is your is your spokesperson you know you got you you know you got and grew to go after somebody\nYou have the quote of the day it was muted and I didn't earn muted\nCan transcend once you get another lesson in life from Senator Bill Cassidy so you have a bright bright piece is pretty interesting it and it seems to be that if if we got FBI probes on our minds and things we want the FBI to look at it everybody wants to investigate everything\nYou have an idea or two about something that might be investigated and that might be collusion that actually exists among Democrats to smear judge Kavanaugh\nTotally so Democrats are trying to make out like this for some sort of organic uprising of people coming out to say the judge Kavanaugh was not not not credible even though the for people that they said were there\nSet it didn't happen but this clearly is a tactic strategy with tactics or would you smear him you create doubt you create doubt and therefore you know why they want to take back the Senate they'd be in ... Democrats at which point they would block a future Trump appointee by the way there's already a website\nFor the woman Coney Barrett that was nominated it's stop I'm\nI'm a considered I'm Sorry I considered it stop Kony ... dot com and it says Web site coming soon so if Trump comes up with another appointee in capping off whatever reason I can get appointed they already are preparing now this is collusion this is a strategy\nAnd its fooling them and they're trying to fool the American people that just have the FBI going after people wait a second was this part of a strategy did you seek out someone to ... to testify against\nJudge Kavanaugh did you deliberately not released a letter\nUntil after you knew you sacrifice factor for its confidentiality that you do it as part of a tired of it as part of a strategy to smear judge Kavanaugh in public as opposed to have a ... that is find out\nMark you know I mean here of the American people are they're trying to see the American people that should be turned up that should be you know if you will like cast appointed\nIn ... by all means if we got questions everybody wants to be asking all these questions we got a couple of questions we liked to have asked ourselves\nHey I've got a couple of the remaining couple of minutes let me get greedy when you look at and real cash that he was also on the Finance Committee big day the White House I don't know about you as a conservative DNA and mean means that terrorists are not usually my favorite thing\nBut doggone advantage there there's maybe on the list of stuff to Trump's made me a believer I mean here's candidate here's Mexico saying okay we're ready to play nice now how did they strike you\nI think the president said he ran said he wanted to redo NAFTA can be read it after it's one more promises he made that he has subsequently kept I think NAFTA has worked well for American workers in my state we have a positive balance of trade with Mexico and with Canada\nUm ah you told me or for taxes you go along the border with Mexico there's so much prosperity where they want was not\nIt's created a lot of jobs for a lot of folks in my state and across the country but it didn't need to be done and the president has already done it and he's going to take care of the American worker\nAs well as have a trade with Mexico and Canada I think it's a good thing\nHow's your what your I'm crystal ball in the midterms\n[noise] you know if the if the people are focusing upon the economy and a part of the fact that President the president made promises kept promises that I think Republicans will do okay if we're focused\nOn things that are peripheral\nOr which of course Democrats are trying to keep all focused on things that are not in a pocket book not in the kitchen table then then ram a tougher time so I'm hoping the American people are focusing on my gosh my watch a lot better now than it was three years ago when I go with the team that brought me the the better life\nAnd finally back into the halls of the U.S Senate I don't know if you have a chance to run into a Joe Manchin Joe Donnelly Heidi Heitkamp police strike you as the kind of people they voted for Gorsuch all three of them who might ultimately they're looking for a reason to get some cover to vote for Kavanaugh to the they don't get killed in their own home states\nI think you just I think if you're just being fair if\nYou're just being fair you're going to say everybody Dr Ford says should be a witness said either don't remember or that it didn't happen\nI think the FBI will find the same thing\nSo I'm hoping Donnelly hike camp others will say they were going to vote on the behalf of fairness\nShouldn't be about electoral politics it should be about what is fair to a fellow American and this will be fair to a fellow American um after both Ford and Kevin ... to unfairly by Senate Democrats so I'm hoping they vote for fairness\nSenator and Dr Bill Cassidy of Louisiana

indignation that he should 'cause I think a couple of moments ago you said you understood how somebody might react pretty emotionally if they're being falsely accused of something you seem to have some empathy for that\nThere's no evidence to support Dr Ford story none so when I'm getting from years you don't want to talk to the judge have it on the court because of like thirty seconds of of
