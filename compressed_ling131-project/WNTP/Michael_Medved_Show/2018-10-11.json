exodus\nView you know that do not steal when the ten commandments do you know that do not steal was always understood in the ancient world it was already understood as primarily of course it meant don't steal property but first and foremost meant don't steal people don't kidnap\nHow many people know that but I'm telling you people knew it I don't know how people defend that slavery on the basis of the Bible the notion that you know one of a nose sons ham it was\nA was cursed because he was black and it's it's it's so stupid it's so attached to zero bases zero zero basis in the\nBible which I point out in the genesis book which is coming you could pre order the next book now on Amazon\nSecond volume by the way if you know a pastor a priest or a minister rabbi or get them as a gift might

spent ten days and I just had to take one day off I mean it's I tell you the truth I ever impressed myself I don't I've never said that [laughter]\nIt's not the way I think but\nThat I Do the show and I do the column and I do to speak you get I Do ... are you and I'm writing this I look back and I think whoa when did I find time but I did take ten days with three other people are just reading\nAll day long except for the show but yesterday took off 'cause the the two of the three left us to be left today\nSo here's an interesting one for you right you all know this verse every one of you when you finish your secular if you don't know what it's really a sign of biblical illiteracy and gods said in the third verse of the Bible what there'll be like what light as\nInteresting question isn't it it's perplexed me my whole life I fought until I Would say until this past year finalizing genesis that that was the big bang\nWhich would which makes perfect sense and by the way I Can't prove

day and vegetation was was before that\nAnd this is one of their favorite I deal with all the objections to the Bible's authenticity in the course of my five volumes\nAnd they have made it clear this was the son and their understanding of science and scripture\nAnd what happens on the fourth day is the ... the sun and the moon become visible remember the earth was covered by thick layer whether it was gas or moisture clouds so nothing was visible but it was created\nAnd as the astrophysicist in ah the physicist than in MIT and Israel said to me ah she's she has seen photosynthesis take place on a completely cloudy day\nPlants do not need a visible sun in order to to grow\nMet interesting show with the visibility of the sun\nTakes place on the fourth day of creation or whether the twenty four

show first off of course a Kanye\nWest goes to the White House and this could be one of the most um unusual presidential meetings since December twenty first Nineteen Seventy\nThat was when there was a summit meeting between the king and the president or Elvis Presley came to the White House to get certified as a an operative in the war on drugs\nNo I'm not making it up um Elvis was kind of making it up as you went along we will we will get to that but I'm One of the things that is amazing to me about this whole Kanye a\nAnd a Trump story is the outrage over it I mean okay do I think it's weird of course it's weird it's Kanye West it's it's strange um do I think the Kanye West is in full possession of his faculties\nI don't know maybe not but so would would people criticize a liberal politician for meeting with the likes of Kanye West\nOr for people who are major stars\nWho have more serious mental health problems and Kanye West I don't think so I think a lot of this is basically the outrage of the day aimed at President Trump and [laughter] I I'm having watched the whole thing I I Do think that President Trump a deserves some credit for sitting and\nListening quietly respectfully too profound words of wisdom\nWhen like this about that beautiful red hat that Kanye West has been wearing recently listen it was something about when I\nOff and make you feel like Superman made a Superman that was about ... favorite superhero and your mayor Superman case for me also at the guy that looks up so you look\nTo American industry guy nonpolitical Raul has a dog right now you have a hard to go through because I did when I went and I found the Fifteen we're working on moving to go ahead dollars\nA year now we are thirty eight billion dollar mark and cast calls and easy buffet\nOkay it's the ... easy effect\nOkay I'm I'm not I'm not so sure I don't know if they've fact check Tanya yet but he does have some political science theories as well for instance this explanation of why his fellow African Americans are so overwhelmingly democratic\nYou know people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrats I\nHave a a I have conversations that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all it it is a limit to amount of jobs are so the fathers do the job then they say we'll give you more money for having more kids\nIn your home and then we got rid of the mental health Institute in the eighties and nineties and the prisoner rapes\nJust shot up and now you ... where people caution Iraq which is actually are a murder rate is going down by twenty percent every year I just talked to the superintendent met with Microsoft Access Ron ROMs the right hand man so uh I think it's the Waverly that helps\nYou to the game called\nYou know they try to scare\nMe to not where the pet my own friends but it's had it gives me it gives me power in a way\nI I Wonder if he has a share in the sales of a mega hats I Believe the proceeds from selling mega has to go to a promote a President Trump's reelection campaign by the way if someone\nCan explain what what Kanye West just said to the president now the president is listening very respectfully and nodding and he also got a a lesson on constitutional law concerning the thirteenth amendment that was the amendment outlawing slavery hears Kanye West is a lot of things\nDo to make a good for anything that was a\nThe caller certainly from him and I did it say about this with the hat off because why would you ... around the country do\nYou feel it in a floor of the competition is ... of our our history of our ... are part of your mind how would you attract\nOr that if you mess up and it was really somehow involved and you know\nAll that travel around the\nShip before just in the fall\nAnd I think the universe works is perfect ... starting floor but when\nThe people they were mending also at that\nIt was the legal for black to read or African Americans to really [noise] oh and so that meant if you actually\nMimic\n\nOkay ah [laughter] so much is wrong with this um\nI ... I Would think that it would be very useful for ...\n... honestly to sit down or maybe with a lovely or ms west with Kim car dashing\nAnd they could watch the uh great Daniel Day Lewis movie Lincoln because that's all about how we brought him Lincoln was the driving force behind getting the thirteenth amendment passed it was his last great achievement\nOr before his assassination\nAnd I don't know what he's saying it it is absolutely true it was illegal in southern states\nTo try to teach black people to read but by the way that didn't stop people like ... ... Jackson Thomas John Jackson\nFrom teaching at a a school for black children slave children in Lexington, Virginia a where he he was a professor of physics at Virginia military Institute anyway the point about all of this\nIs that some of the great intellectuals of the civil war period like Frederick Douglass were emphatically black he was born a slave and he could not only read he could write powerfully and many others could as well\nOr he um talks a little bit about some of his own challenges a here's Kanye West again speaking right in front of the resolute desk there in the oval office to the White House with President Trump\nTower I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder pilots connected with a narrow psychologist that works with the athletes\nAre the NBA NFL and he looked at my\nRight a little more ...\nI ...\nI had a Seventy five percent of all human beings what it was probably a number for a doctor is going to work with that one the other one Ninety ...\nYou know so far he says\nThat actually was that bipolar I actually got probation which would call the ... ten to Twenty years from now I wouldn't even remember my son's day\nIt's all this power that I guess and I'll take my son is a soccer game and all that I wouldn't be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosis from what we need it we can have our the pharmaceuticals and make more money\nUh-huh um\nSleep deprivation look at it can be a serious problem and again this is something bragging about his IQ tests and things like that\nOr he's not talking about as great grades you got in school but there are other prominent public figures who have the same kind of confidence in their own cognitive ability or a finally I'm ... spoke about his gift to the president of the United states\nI\nIt all the major far\nAh I brought a product just what me right here um [noise] this right here to explain why there's a high\nFor a airplane and this is our president fly and look at it as your [noise]\nWill\nAmerica company and work on the fire was\nOkay um I I I think that for the\nSecret Service should\nReview the hydrogen powered plane before\nPresident Trump flies on a one of the things it's amazing about this is the unbelievable indignation expressed by people in the mainstream media which I think is way over the top\nIf you have a reaction to ah the Kanye West meeting of the mines with the president of the United states or if you believe that this is I'm\nJust further evidence that we are approaching some kind of cataclysmic civil war\nThere was a matter of a U.S senator and his wife being threatened with the heading we'll get to that and more coming up on them eventually\nAnd we're not we're not a or where they have it at all I some of that stuff that was said I'm as we wonder at the top uh there was a bit of profanity wait there was actually more than you heard we we were able to bleach some of it out [noise] um but there was a ... to make it in there that was crazy\nAbout ...

I think she should to ah take a police\nTime this kind of phony nonsense\nIs is disgusting and it's a way of attacking America\nBecause it tries to lead people to believe that somehow America's

breaking ranks to show strong support for the presidents of course the ... going to encourage it and the idea that how can the president do this when people are suffering in Florida\nThe president's been very outspoken you spoken many times about the horrible devastation from hurricane Michael\nAnd I actually think the president's also done a fine and preemptive\nJob I'm preparing the relief agencies for dealing with a situation here was that Chris Matthews on MSNBC was attacking Trump for doing something else while this Florida\nThing was going on we will will play that in\nIn just a moment but the whole idea that somehow because we have this hurricane of the president isn't allowed to do something else or somehow shows disrespect look\nThis entire obsession with President Trump I think isn't working for Democrats and shouldn't because we're coming up to an election is going to decide the direction we want to go\nAnd honestly I think that when you take a look at situations like this hurricane and a lot of Republicans up there in the Florida Panhandle but there are a lot of Democrats too when there are a lot of people don't really care that much about politics they all need help and support\nAnd I think they're getting that both from their state government under the great governor of Florida Rick Scott and they're getting it from the federal government doing a decent job\nSo the freak out and the attempt to make this count politically against the president\nSeems to me utterly inappropriate when we come back I'll tell you what I'm with Chris Matthews has to say the no thrill up his leg but he is um he's angry at President Trump for one for doing something you know other colleges ever done right well we'll get to it [noise]\n\nIt was the money but he would W.

Bernie Sanders last time\nI don't support I just go on record so those good things of other politicians do good things are bad things are just comment on it\nWould you acknowledge that are there are some things and you you do in your book surprisingly that there are some things that President Trump is addressed a where you think he's on the right track\nWell it doesn't it doesn't go over for example we need a big public infrastructure investment in this country he made a big day our jobs jobs jobs report in schools so we're drinking water systems public transit roads bridges on that\nIt took the current issue away from the Democrats and Republicans interesting\nBoth Democrats and Republicans that didn't pay attention to all those little communities all those are unemployed blue collar workers or with the industry shipped to China and Mexico and he grabbed it from him and he got a lot of votes as a result but is that him or is that the dean for all of the Democrats and Republicans\nDo you have you looked over the new replacement for NAFTA the new deal because I Know you're a big critic of NAFTA\n[noise] yeah you know until my son and final form Michael to the Congress we're only getting bits and pieces we like to have the whole formal a proposed a grammar\nBut it looks like it was twenty to rather than reforms in other words a little bit here a small amount of dairy products going over the Canadian border\nThe Mexicans got a little but the U.S got rid of this craziness were Canadian and Mexican corporation can sue the federal government saying they go\nLaunches because of health and safety regulations in place but it was not a reform it still subordinates to commercial power the labor environment and consumer rights of all three countries\nAnd right now if we had another terrible day on Wall street the Dow Jones industrial average is down more than five hundred points they were down eight hundred and thirty points yesterday so it's a very very big loss\nOr an over at Wall Street a lot of people are saying that's big cause of this talk of a trade war with China do buy it\nYeah that's part of it and the other is fear of higher interest rates are screwed for small savers by the way they've been Sean of any of your income for a decade with one\nTenth of one percent interest rate in the banks and money markers and the third thing Wall Street is generally about hasn't happened yet is inflation\nAnd how can you imagine after almost stumped on Wall street it's still I think ... was on January first\nSo what to do it if you say because what you say why isn't too late to reverse course how would you like to see America reverse course\nBy taking a change in our country or interactions supported by liberals and conservatives you know that's my argument and if you do that by\nRestoring inflation guarded minimum wage for thirty million workers making us today and inflation adjusted wages in Nineteen sixty eight\nOr ... free choice of doctor and hospital much less expensive and started enforcing the war against drug industry and other health industry\nA few hours ... price\nAnd let me just interrupt you for a moment and Medicare for all and by the way I um I I there there are millions and millions of Americans who depend on Medicare who needed who'd a live or because of it\nAnd uh ... how where do you find the money to pay for Medicare for a a literally a hundred million people may be more who have never paid in to Medicare\n[noise] well Brian places number one it's a much more efficient system so you're cutting your administrative expenses today of over twenty two percent to about four percent that's experiencing Canada\nWorking but wait wait I Hope you're talking about right now there are literally tens of millions of people I think the number is well over a hundred million I think it might be close to two hundred million who are covered by workplace insurance at least in part yeah so uh where where do you get this money to put them on Medicare\nWell they wouldn't have to pay their insurance the employers wouldn't have to pay they'd be more competitive with Canadian and foreign company companies have their insurance paid by a public sources\nSo is it isn't that isn't that a big giveaway during the ...\nThe tax system is crazy I mean you know you got corporations today paying ... percent tax three percent tax look at the banks because apple and they're they're they're paying virtually nothing or some workers paying twenty three twenty five percent tax going to work every day\nYou know what I'm saying is I get rid of corporate welfare I Know you agree with that that's hundreds of billions of dollars a year\nAnd the other thing is to crack down on criminal fraud there's there's broad on Medicare or from these van Dorn sixty billion a year just on Medicare so we have to raise the corrupt inefficient discriminatory system that is increasingly saying to the airport parent die\nOkay politically do you think any of these things can possibly happen say if the Democrats take over the house and the Republicans maintain control of the Senate and President Trump continues as he well as our commander in chief\nYeah I think the the wage increase is supported by Seventy five percent of the people without even a campaign because of all these people who\nYou're

towards twelve dollars the federal seven dollars and twenty five cents I think the Republicans I got the message on that politically for twenty twenty\nOkay so you raise the minimum wage let's say ... raised first stage even all the way to twelve dollars I'm given the fact that in in most big cities in many jurisdictions have already raised the minimum wage or does that have a profound effect on the American economy\nYou're increases consumer imam people can buy more than ... necessities on the table you don't get many savings from increased minimum wage because they can't afford to pay him so I got to buy goods and services is good for the economy I mean you're concerned demand is two thirds of our economy\nUm what about economic growth or what happens economic growth they have all of a sudden uh you are in increasing or the amount of pay you're offering at a time when even right now there's a labor shortage\nWelcome to the labor orange because millions of people have not come into the marketplace wherever smaller number of people have been paying jobs now than many years because of all the dropouts people just couldn't get jobs in prior years\nThe other thing is you know and

they're actually a lot of Americans according appalling who agree with that but I\nActually it is a complete fantasy because it never ever can happen\nOr I Want to get back to Ralph Nader and we'll talk with your calls one eight hundred and Ninety five by Seventeen Seventy six [noise] about how exactly do you get rid of the electoral college Saddam basically ... whole amendment process and the constitution we'll be right\nBack Michael Mitchell wants to marry this is Michael\nWell I I I understand what people are talking about here was the electoral compact and I am aware of it\nBut part of what that means is that the ah the states the various states who sign onto it or would be pledged\nTo actually gave them all the electrical those in their states to not to the person who wins the popular vote in the state but the person who wins the national popular vote so suddenly make the electoral college would still exist I guess but it will become irrelevant which\nMakes us better be in vain neutralized\nOkay I Do you know I I Do think there are people who are already preparing legal challenges to that compact idea plus right now all the states you mentioned are very very blue stage very liberal state do you see any support for this compact idea from some of the more conservative states\nIn the next time the Republicans won the popular vote for president and lose the electoral college vote when you got the rest of the states in a landslide\nBy the way you know that's never happened the only popular vote losers who has ever been elected I'm actually are a Republican and John ... to ...\nBecause of carrying got sixteen thousand more votes it would have carried Ohio and won the electoral college battle or even know it got more votes popularly\nSuch true that is what it was a danger I I like the idea Ralph and I've talked about on the air before\nOf everybody going to the Nebraska main system that you break it down by congressional district but in order to do that you would have to really make it a nonpartisan not gerrymandered a portion of congressional districts what do you think about that because I enter a\nStep forward it doesn't go as far as the national popular vote dot com yeah that is a step forward I mean it's ridiculous when you come in second in the popular vote in America and you lose the ... and you're winning the presidency ... what country does\nOkay well our our country does and it's actually historically it's worked out a okay I mean and president Hayes wasn't the disaster some of us think President Bush wasn't a disaster\nAnd are certainly hope that President Trump will continue to enjoy some of the success he's enjoyed so far\nRalph Nader's enjoyed great success with his literary legal and even some political endeavors\nHis

Washington\nHe says yesterday a caller proposed that we are in the Cold War and the political sense he rejected it and he had trouble defining you stated that the object of a war is to defeat an enemy\nActually I didn't say that I said the\nObject of a war is to destroy an enemy is to kill your enemy and wreck his stuff just wipe them out\nIt's not just defeat\nJohn says this is exactly what is going on meaning to defeat an enemy not to destroy and the Democrats have decided to use any means necessary to defeat the Kavanaugh nomination they've abandoned all decency\nIt is a Cold War because bullets are not being shot but there is no question the Democrats mean too politically professional and socially killed Brett Kavanaugh it is a Cold War\nAnd now ... and his family are getting death threats is this is not a Cold War Michael I don't know what would be a Democrats have Declared Political unprofessional war against this man looks the term Cold War is also misunderstood\nWhat people mean by Cold War is limited war\nIt was not bloodless we lost fifty eight thousand Americans in Vietnam we lost almost forty thousand in Korea\nUh during the so called Cold War we lost countless other Americans in different hot spots around the world are there were very certainly an episode of the Cold War was the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the pushback against that a lot of people who died\nAnd I do think is wrong to analogize\nThe idea of of trying to smear and discredit somebody and wreck his career I think it's despicable I think what the Democrats did was despicable I think there are whole handling of the cabinet matter was shameful and unconscionable and wrong and his right to be condemned\nBut to call it murder\nIs also liberating distinctions and I think sanctions that need to be restored to our public debate I'll give you one example\nI woke up thinking about this is people are now talking about everybody has a survivor right and anybody who was ever complained about sexual misbehavior some guy no matter how far in the past or how limited than this behavior is now a survivor of abuse\nAnd I was thinking of Anita Hill and this is not to say that if Clarence Thomas were guilty of the things he's accused of that it would be justifiable indefensible would have been wrong or but the idea that any of the hill a survivor what did she survived exactly\nShe survived um some rude comments that made her uncomfortable\nThat saw\nCharges any workplace consequences to her work by Clarence Thomas no charges that he ever touch\nI I mean to say that is a survivor\nAnd somebody who's been raped at knife point is also a survivor of there's a difference and yes there's a difference between Bill Cosby\nAnd Les Moonves if you want Bill Cosby drugged people that's more serious\nAnd to lose all perspective to say that we are now dealing with the civil war because we're dealing with a moral issue the equivalent of slavery\n... it's it's just wrong\nAnd no one expects that there are big parts of America that are going to have their duly tossed to the government's leave\nThe union form armies and we're all going to be finding one another and they're going to be hundreds of thousands or killed\nSo the analogy with a civil war I think detracts from people's engagement with reality\nWhere you can make a real difference in bringing America to a more constructive place by voting in this election I Hope everybody does\nAnd vote for sanity\nAnd Saturday mean stop the talk of impeaching Kavanaugh stopped to talk of impeaching Trump stopped to talk of oh my goodness this is the ... total nightmare of The Handmaid's tale we're losing all our liberties and the women are being\nGround down as the end of the world get a grip we have some problems in this country but hysteria doesn't health and solutions let's go to\nNorth ridge California Eric you're on the ... that show disagreement day\nMike I'm a longtime listener conservative here\nAnd um I Do agree that this commentary about the civil war is a over rod in its comments but I disagree with you you are in that I Do see a future of separation coming a rich history reformed calls\nAnd what's actually coming to this coming in the horizon for our country is a divorce\nThis idea that there's going to be a war you are yourself or just building this up with this idea that there'd be hundreds of thousands of people killed\nWe have a great separation we have a mechanism available to us and I'm Wondering why what what\nIs the mechanism what's the mechanism\nOh say they're just one moment let me say this we talked about before why would you deprive be one of the great rights provided to me in the constitution and that's the freedom of association\nI didn't have no you know you'll have you'll have you'll have to really find it more than don't but you you live in the same country with them you live in the same country with them there is no right in the constitution for secession it doesn't exist I Know and\nThat's not we discuss before it's lots of session what it is is dissolution of the union which has provided through article five the mechanism is available through article five would not be a war\nOkay how what how was how is the mechanism provided for dissolution of the union they never anticipated that and it's not there there's an article five a convention of the states is to proposed changes in the constitution that's still have to then be approved by three quarters of the states the\nMike I called in about a year ago you had a constitutional scholar on and he agreed you you simply don't\nWant it no no no no I it's it's it's if you believe a convention of the states could provide for the dissolution of the union or you just have to then get three quarters of the states to vote to dissolve the union and they want\nAs a student of history Mike I Want to quote something to winning the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the bans a bind them to another\nVet have had that African academically now there are some ... of them but but go ahead okay so that's the\nDeclaration of independence and our great founding fathers realize that these things happen in the\nCourt okay so tell me tell me what you believe is the issue that is worth dissolving the union\nOver well you're in you crush me on that before and a habit for you and you've never wanted to answer and that is the\nKilling the murder of over forty million American\nBabies that al ... actually written into the Democrat platform\nOkay again that can be a reason you don't want to associate with Democrats but frankly right now we have made tremendous progress in reducing the abortion rate\nBut if you think that somehow it will help to save lives to save the lives of the unborn by breaking up the United states of America which is the greatest force for good in the history of human time [noise]\nI think your ... how we will be right back\nThe ... what do you mean they're not being dealt with in other words the two parties disagree and it's a tough time of tough time to find middle ground\nBut you say that are are medical care system you don't think we spent a long time over the last ten years arguing about that it's more than ten years when Bill Clinton was first elected president when he came into the Nineteen nineties yeah\nMichael who's you're working for working for the medical industry the insurance industry and the attorneys loaded ... is\nThis is great for them to have gotten extremely wealthy and more powerful by doing nothing except tried it off load to the courts or through the executive branch out to the laws you talked\nVery OK well wait wait wait wait wait I again when you talk about some kind of establishment conspiracy was the establishment for Obamacare or was it against Obamacare\n... it was for it [noise]\nOkay ah then ... you will agree with me that there was a very significant difference of opinion between Republicans and Democrats or wasn't a single Republican not even one in either house and Congress voted for Obama Care\nAbsolutely there's not an issue there but I Would like wait\nWait you're saying that they know where this issue the last had their own approach to medical care which I think was the wrong approach which is the medical care needs to improve his more government involvement I think we would all benefit from less government involvement\nAnd art and people having more freedom of choice and getting their own insurance arrangements that it\nIt seems to me is going to be one of the challenges for the next two years for President Trump and the Republicans if we maintain our majorities in Congress we we've got to continue moving in that direction the idea that these issues that you bring up\nA little aren't instantly resolved ah it it doesn't mean that there's some kind of establishment conspiracy look there are a lot of people\nIn the United states of America who are doing a lot better in the last two years and it is not just rich people\nThe ah the fact is that if you look at the wages that have been going up I mean even Ralph Nader acknowledge that when we were talking to him on the economic growth that has happened in the last two years has benefited everybody in the country\nAnd look we've had two bad days on Wall street I Hope that won't be the end but you see the the problem with all these ideas about some all knowing establishment is trying to put some order some fake water into what is by its very nature a very just orderly and sometimes chaotic process\nOr it is disagreement day on the Michael ... that show that means that is your day to take me on on issues\nWhere you think I Am
