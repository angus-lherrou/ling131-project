program\nWe'll also talk about another source of political unity for the United states which is a a complete contempt total contempt\nThen is shared by Americans are black and white and Latino and Asian and rich and poor and living in the interior live on the coasts everybody shares can him for political correctness\nThis is something that is stunning and there is a new study that a ... over at Harvard has written about yes Harvard we'll we'll get to that in just a moment\nAnd uh there's something else that uh I I think should unite Americans but maybe doesn't yet which is a fear\nOf another impeachment crisis I mean Democrats are being more and more serious and more and more credible saying if we win the house of representatives let alone the Senate\nWe're going forward with impeaching Brett Kavanaugh we're going forward with impeaching President Trump\nIs that a good idea will talk to one of the people who was central to the last impeachment crisis we had his name as a judge Ken Starr he was in charge of the investigation that led to the impeachment\nOf Bill Clinton\nWhat is the lessons for today's political world in one of the lessons for Robert Mueller who's playing the same kind of jobs that are that the Ken Starr function in back in the Nineteen nineties one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nOn this issue of political correctness first as there's this amazing piece in ah the Atlantic of all places in the Atlantic is not a conservative journal headline Americans strongly disliked dislike PC culture\nAnd this is stunning\nIn the way that it shows that hatred for contempt for resistance to political correctness\nBrings together everybody\nHe um\n... what what they write about is this is if you look at what Americans have to say on issues such as immigration the extent of white privilege\nAnd the prevalence of sexual harassment there distinct clusters that emerge progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberal politically disengaged moderates et cetera et cetera okay one thing just fascinating here is people who are traditional conservatives\nFar outnumber those who say they're progressive activists by twenty five percent or conservative eight percent are progressive activists\nBy contrast the two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme constitute an exhausted majority their members share a sense of the tea with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints lack of voice in the national conversation\nI think that's exactly right and you can count me uh yeah I I mean I I Would\nProbably be grouped together with a twenty five percent who are devoted conservatives they say traditional conservatives but they're certainly elements sometimes you feel like part of an exhausted majority\nAnd then they go on tour right they say most members of this exhausted majority remember that's eighty percent of the public and then some dislike political correctness among the general population full eighty percent believe that political correctness is a problem in our country\nEven young people are uncomfortable with it\nIncluding Seventy four percent between the ages of twenty four and twenty nine and of those under twenty four Seventy nine percent that means the people who most resent political correctness who think it's a problem in our country or the people are having a shoved down their throats it's not working\nAnd why is this why is this resentments so common and by the way\nWho what racial group resents political correctness most remembers eighty percent of everybody\nYou think why people you're on the\nUh racial group that most resents political correctness as American Indians are second or Hispanics Hispanics have political correctness and agents\nMay harried I'm political correctness or even more than white people do\nBlack people Seventy five percent resent political correctness think it's a problem in the country and this piece in the Atlantic votes a forty year old American indian and Oklahoma who participate in a focus group is part of this project and it's an interesting project\nBut uh\nThis American indian again forty years old said it seems like every day you wake up something has changed do say Jew or Jewish is it a black guy or African American you have to be on your toes because you never know what to say so political correctness in that sense as scary\nThree quarters of African Americans opposed political correctness this means that they're only four percentage points less likely than whites\nAnd only five percentage points less likely than the average to believe that political correctness is a problem okay uniting blacks and whites and young and old can we say no to political correctness\nAnd that goes for political correctness even in San Francisco or this is an amazing story about someone named Steve on don't taste even his name is Steve on S. T. V. O. and\nHe is the new president of the San Francisco Unified School district and they've had a long standing tradition for the San Francisco Unified School district\nA tradition of I'm beginning each public meeting by saying the pledge of allegiance well no more\nInstead the first meeting the Steve on ... presided over as president San Francisco invite school district sounded like this\nThank you tonight we start this for me to get out of the claim American writer and activist Maya Angelou who wants to when you learn teach when you get give [noise]\nSection ... is accessibility to information for public section B. opening items approval of foreign minister for September twenty fifth ... motion the second please Selma surgeon ...\nOkay and then they go forward into the meeting a no pledge of allegiance and instead a a phony quote why do I say it's a funny quote the Washington Post ... actually looked at this um this quote that as allegedly from Maya Angelou the only source for\nBelieving that she ever said it was that Oprah Winfrey a\nSet at that Maya Angelou said it but there's no record that you have a road that are set it or anything like that and by the way what does it mean when you learn teach when you get give\n'em a\n... I'm not sure what that means okay here's the story of Steve on cook she's a young man he grew up in public housing he did very well in school he went to Williams College very exclusive high ranking liberal arts college in Massachusetts\nAnd um then he came back to San Francisco he's involved in a number of social initiatives and gum self like through the school board is now the school board president\nBut he said the um\nThe move dropping the pledge of allegiance and instead of calling Maya Angelou was not a demonstration in the vein of Colin Kaepernick another San Francisco bureau in close or he says I was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nHe told the San Francisco ... chronicles of the current current political climate was disappointing and if the Trump Administration has quote been attacking our liberties\nOkay you can even say all kinds of things about the Trump Administration where it's been the Trump Administration been attacking liberties I hadn't heard that before what what liberties exactly as the Trump Administration attacked\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then he said I don't spend much time thinking about President Trump yeah I think that's probably true\nHe says although there is a requirement that schools conduct a pledge or similar activity there is no such requirement for school boards that was the statement from the district spokeswoman whose name is Lauren dead Nick and no one in the audience of beer to mind\nCooks new introduction well of course not at San Francisco and now they are planning on having other quotes from other were these odd to begin in a place of the pledge of allegiance those will include Harvey Milk James Baldwin\nToni Morrison the Wright brothers Abraham Lincoln and more\nUm [noise] so what's wrong with this\nUh well he actually dissented from the majority opinion said nearly a century ago Marilyn citizens out of deep respect and gratitude took on the daunting task erecting a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these heroes had so noble e achieved\nThe panel majority says their effort violates the constitution the soldiers fought to defend I respectfully think otherwise\nIt is outrageous and one of the points that has raised an important column by a Jeremy ... is one of the lawyers involved in this case is not too far away from this monument and Maryland is Arlington National cemetery\nAnd if this decision stands up it won't it's going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and there will be probably a seven to two decision against the stupidity the story here as private citizens decided to honor people from that community who died in World War one\nBy creating a monument in their honor\nAnd putting it up with public subscriptions it was not using taxpayer money it was all paid for by donations they put up this monument to honor the war dead\nAnd now if this court decision stands the monument would have to be removed destroyed or defaced to a race to cross\nThis is outrageous\nAnd it's why the judicial issues are so important let's go to Rick in Los Angeles Rick you're on the Michael ...\nThanks so much Michael for taking my call I have a couple of ... uh you know on this issue that you brought up first of all the gentleman in San Francisco who thinks that their freedoms are being attacked I I Love this about ... you know all you have to do now is this week\nWith those views that they hold and all of a sudden it's become an attack right that's how they would know this is absolutely ...\nAnd the other examples you're bringing I mean you know thank our wonderful a higher education system we all we have this now hate America embarrassed for America anything old in traditional like the constitution or get it\nThis is outdated now we have to form a New America which you know the almighty less phony moral list and I'm Supreme as they think they are they're going to shape a new American\nWhat your bed you're exactly right but this gives us an opportunity and the opportunity is based upon this other study that I threw into the mix which is a very profound\nStudy will get to more of that it doesn't matter whether you're white or black or older young for rich or poor or liberal or conservative Americans had it up to here with political correctness so time to rally the troops on this issue how we'll talk about it's coming up with your calls ...

happening with the Mueller investigation or if you're concerned about the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation there is extremely relevant material\nOn all of that in contempt\nIs subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation the author is Ken Starr and a jet star I've I've got to tell you this book is so readable it is so relevant and some of the revelations are\nMost sensational unsatisfying and uh the the book is posted at our website of Michael med dot com in writing it\nAnd then the response to the book which has been overwhelming since it's come out what surprised you most\nOf what surprised me very positive way is that the Clinton a spin machine has remained silent\nAnd I said I said and and I don't think that to be unkind but to the other the conscience spin cycle is Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post style but uh was extraordinarily busy and energetic and somewhat say highly effective\nAt uh taking a an issue with what seemed to me to be indisputable or the is the facts and so I'm very pleased about that the other thing Michael I Would say is that there's so many eerie echoes\nFrom the past that we are hearing today and you mentioned to impeachment that's very high on the list because as you though\nA impeachment was ...\nReally controversial in the nineties and yet some of those crying for impeach but now with some of the most of the surfers voices saying how dare you the\nUh the book is called contempt and now more of the Clinton investigation or Hillary Clinton doesn't come off are so very well in your book\nYes and ah it'll turn the other cheek and uh and kindness so to others and so forth but it's just the facts and and and and the facts are are\nAre in sort of the day new mall was when we and the investigation seriously considered presenting an indictment or to the federal grand jury and little log naming Hillary Rodham Clinton alone for her crimes in connection with\nThe Little Rock Arkansas face of the investigation [noise] in addition a during the course of interviews with her at the White House she stood in such complete contrast in terms of sort of relational skills and the like\nWith her spouse Bill Clinton who of course is immensely charming and charismatic and a empathy at the all the rest of it and she said as I say in the book seem to be just sort of deliberately in your face a A R massive\nA failure of recollection not only strain credulity Michael we chose to that by the time we assessed all of her answers we knew that she was ah she was lying under oath\nFainting or a failure recollection there was so colossal so profound that it's simply could not have been true\nOkay you clearly\nBelieve a and I know because he said this house where it it would be a mistake to pursue for Democrats or to pursue impeachment proceedings\nAgainst a either a justice Kavanaugh who used to work with you or against President Trump or why why would that be such a destructive course for the country and and I mean you can relate that to some of the lessons in your book content\nYes Michael it goes back\nTo the a structural protections built into the constitution to prevent\nMob rule and we heard senator corner during the Kavanaugh hearings so to speak about mob rule which seem to be the disorder of the day and the dystopia that we all experience to work stoned out but the\nFounding generation wanted a and demanded a supermajority requirement in the Senate a simple majority of the house the people's house should put the issue in the play\nAt their discretion so the majority can simply send articles over but then there needs to be a bipartisan consensus\nThat the practical political message and the two thirds super majority requirement a embodied in our constitution so don't go there there's just no reason

if their grounds for condemning and I'm saying if their breath grounds condemning the president but it's it's a foregone conclusion that impeachment will not succeed and that the the ... the United
