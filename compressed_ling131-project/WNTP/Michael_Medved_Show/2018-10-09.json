Patel like does it appeared in the New York times under the heading I'm just a middle aged how sad addicted to pot\nAnd he writes about going to his first marijuana anonymous meeting in West Hollywood that it'd be\nAlmost a year ago\nHe says it was friday night and the room was packed with addicts semi age with most younger struggling to recover life\nLost to weed and then he writes this and I think it's extraordinarily powerful I mean seriously powerful\nHe says that there's a reason that Alcoholics Anonymous started in Nineteen thirty five\nWhat's the reason that was two years after the end of prohibition alcohol abuse became rampant and the country almost rank itself off the rails\nWas the same thing happened with marijuana\nNow by the way this is really important because it's historically true most people think oh you know prohibition was a gigantic failure people drank just as much under prohibition\nAnd then they ended prohibition and everything was happy this by the way it was a big Republican democratic issue was one of the first things have Franklin Roosevelt did when the Democrats came to power\nOr was end the prohibition amendments to uh go ahead and repeal the prohibition of men\nBut the truth of the matter is drinking did go up when prohibition went away it did go down when prohibition was imposed now was it worth it I'm not suggesting prohibition of alcohol I'm also not in the midst of fighting a war here to re impose prohibition on marijuana in Washington state\nBut here's the message from Neal Pollack says marijuana isn't alcohol or an opioid you cannot die from an overdose it doesn't really events physical cravings so is it better to call my problem marijuana dependence doesn't matter\nCandidate should be legal he writes just as alcohol should be legal but marijuana addiction exists and it almost wrecked my life\nBecause what I'm Talking about I don't get people were were teenagers in late teens\nAnd basically my freshman year in college pretty much everybody did beer that was the drug of choice and then all of a sudden boom\nIt's a Nineteen sixty six sixty seven and marijuana\nAnd there is no question that the cognitive impairment particularly things like short term memory loss and problem solving there were there were many people including one to the three of the people that I rooms with where it\nWas it was a visible problem if you could see it immediately wasn't subtle\nAuthors examined four thousand students and the Montreal region over four years starting when the average participant was about Thirteen Years old the students took yearly memory tests and self reported their alcohol and marijuana use those reports are kept confidential\nBy the fourth year three quarters of the students and consume alcohol at least occasionally well only about thirty percent use marijuana regularly but the study observe more daily marijuana users and alcohol abusers the study found some of the marijuana as negative effects were lasting\nA particularly troubling finding young cannabis users may cause long term damage to a brain function associated with substance abuse\nWhen studying response inhibition that's an individuals' ability to change their actions tell me the goal researchers found the teams using marijuana cause long term damage to their brains\nLet's go to Don in Ventura, California Don

know\nWell again age the the one thing about this is and and I know that\nThere are a lot of people out there are reaching for their phones right now and saying hey I've been smoking pot for years and years and I'm a sharp as ever\nA out and let let other people that that it ... whenever whenever we do this this issue on the air and it's an important issue because right now there's a very very big industry that's involved in trying to get people to think oh this is just harmless good fun\nThat I learned that I Want to share with everybody and it's a lesson about\nWhy some people are so indignant\nFake news\nAnd that's not to say that I'm not in the ignorant about I'm indignant about this I just that we've had\nBias in the media for a long long time but sometimes it's particularly egregious and I'll give me an example\nI um had watched the news coverage early this morning about the ceremony last night which I had not seen a lot\nAnd the ceremony last night was in the White House with a President Trump welcoming the whole Kavanaugh family the two daughters who are so proud of their dad and his wife Ashley\nThat's a judge Kavanaugh his wife Ashley and just all the judges justices or the spring court were there\nAnd\nWhat I heard about this event was oh it's too bad it was supposed to be such a nicer than Trump ruined dead as it does because what he said was outrageous and he was ... ... and he ruined that never before any spoil that and it's disgusting and horrible\nAs you know what when you watch it that is simply not true\nAnd let me tell you one area where I honestly I think most of the coverage that I saw on NBC\nAnd very much on CNN which is deliberately misleading they made it sound as if a justice Kavanaugh spoke and spoke with\nDignity and then Trump spoke afterward and then ruined everything the justice but it wasn't like that because President Trump spoke first\nAnd he welcome people introduced every they all walked in together and then the president said thank you very much thank you members of Congress members of the cabinet honored gas and fellow Americans\nAt my privilege to address you tonight from the East Room of the White House and then after a welcoming everybody he said joining us for tonight's ceremony as every sitting Supreme Court justice chief justice Roberts thank you Justice Thomas thank you Justice Ginsburg\nThank you Justice Breyer thank you Justice Alito thank you Justice Sotomayor thank you Justice Kagan thank you and justice Gorsuch now why in that order that's the order at which they were appointed to the court\nAnd then he said this in setting up how his particular performance of his duty in helping to watch the swearing in of the justice either a appointed how this was going to be different\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett\nFor the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nWhat happened to the cabinet family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process how our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\n\nOkay and then he goes on to make the most controversial declaration he made in this state meant he goes on to say that the justice or capital was proven innocent now okay he's not proven innocent\nBut he was certainly judged innocent by anybody who's reasonable enough to look at this had to look at the preponderance of evidence of ... of evidence\nWas that anybody who was there at the time any of the name the witnesses agreed with him\nNot in saying that I Know this didn't happen button saying no I I don't remember this at all and I don't remember it at all like the way that\nChristine afford described it here's what President Trump said\nThat use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank you [noise]\n\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his\nI have to serving his fellow citizens and now from the bench of our nation's highest court your father will defend the eternal rights and freedoms of all Americans you know [noise]\nOkay this is just fine and it's touching because you can look at the way the Kavanaugh family his daughters Margaret ... we're looking up at him and his wife Ashley when when President Trump was saying these words and what he says saying he's a man of decency character kindness and courage\nThere is no one who has stood up to say anything different no one and\nAnd you know that if there were someone who said oh yeah ten years ago he cheated mayor ten years ago I saw him beating up somebody areas drunk or is that they would have come forward they wouldn't be publicized a great deal the best they could do\nWas to get three different women none of whom had any\nCorroborating evidence who were charging them with being a jerk freshman year of college or in high school\nAnd [noise] sorry\nThat doesn't take away the idea that he is lived a lifetime showing himself to be a man of decency character kindness encouraged President Trump\nConcluded\nMargaret his allies as presidents tonight reminds us for his historic\nYour father is all about it's about what kind of a nation we're going to be and what kind of a country our children will inherit\nIt is up to each of us and do all Americans watching tonight to answer that question is up to us to reclaim our heritage of equal an impartial justice is up to us to re dedicated ourselves to the traditions and wisdom\nOf our founders and it is up to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection that leads us falls to gather as one great American family [noise]\nAnything\nWrong with that it it doesn't seem to me there as it seems to me that President Trump was in the right spirit for the occasion as he was with these last comments introducing the actual swearing and listen\nJust as kind of enough it was the place left by Anthony Kennedy soon Justice Kennedy will administer the judicial both to Brett Kavanaugh just as she did last year for justice Gorsuch\nThis will be the first time a Supreme Court justice has ever sworn in a form of work to take his seat\nA beautiful moment which reminds us for freedom is a tradition passed down from generation to generation and that's a big state but it I Want to thank you for that so much for [noise]\nIt is beautiful uh if if there's someone who really believes that this was a disgrace somehow that that President Trump ruined this occasion\nYou can give us a call and tell us why 'cause I don't see it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and judge Kavanaugh\nSpoke particularly beautifully\nAnd yes I I think that some of his inter changes with the senators at his hearing more and more testy than they needed to be\nAnd yes he didn't answer all the questions about as high school yearbook perhaps perfectly\nBut you know what in the sweep of history I think President Trump is right the entire process here as manipulated by the likes of Dianne Feinstein and and as true\nAnd uh and Spartacus and Mazie Hirono and a Richard Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse and the rest of them\nAnd that entire process will be remembered\nAs a sham and a disgrace and not a positive thing for the country so this is a good place to turn forward and move ahead when we come back we'll we'll go to your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd we'll also play most\nOf a judge Kavanaugh's justice Kevin O's brief but I think very moving and very well crafted remarks or we will be right back on the dawn of a new day and a new term for the Supreme Court of the United states coming up on that show [noise]\nReally is that is that fair do you think\nWhen President Trump's concluding his remarks said um is that the U.S to read that gay ourselves to the traditions and wisdom of our founders and a desire to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection that link altogether as one great American family\nOkay he acknowledged that it was unusual what he was doing\nBut I Do think that the process that victimized\nBoth Dr blessing forward and justice Kavanaugh that's a process was unusual and not admirable Lou\nAnd Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael Mann that show\n[noise] sure Hi Hi you're on\nAll right yeah um I mean I I don't\nYou know when I look at what what he did he said he was completely um you know proven to be innocent\nUm he didn't he didn't investigate all the people who work at actual witnesses that we're likely witnesses that would have more information it was not a thorough process so for him to go around and do that slap it in our face\nOf the law it'd be voted in two thousand twelve for Obama didn't get Merrick Garland any slap it in our face and say is proven innocent didn't even have a really the only investigation\nThat way when you say when you say phony investigation what do you mean who who is the witnesses or that\nThere were several there were several witnesses that the Ramirez woman I I understand they decide they made a decision they made it it'd be a\nBecause that was not their job what they were asked to do was to investigate Dr Ford and as far as Deborah Ramirez is concerned I mean come on\nCome on it's it's the idea but in other words what they didn't do the FBI and I think we're right not to do it will go through a whole investigation of I'm Brett Kavanaugh's drinking habits when he was a freshman at Yale\nOr when he was a senior in high school why because it was irrelevant the question was if if Deborah Ramirez has some magic witness that you could could have for the fact\nWhich she even said by the way Deborah mayor as you said I was too drunk to really remember this is what she thought happened and it's a recovered memory and it was after the fact\nAnd this is pathetic\nWhat relevance does it have to his qualifications to be on the Supreme Court low\nSo my feeling is you were treated ten times better than Obama and then Merrick Garland was\nOkay I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I guarantee you that Merrick Garland would prefer what happened with him which was great respect no one spoke harshly about him no one's smearing him no one came up with things about his high school days or college days\nAnd probably there is no but he did not get a hearing that doesn't mean you're treated horribly we'll be right back [noise]\n\nNine nine\nConservative talk [noise]\nWith Sri\nNews on the theaters in Washington
