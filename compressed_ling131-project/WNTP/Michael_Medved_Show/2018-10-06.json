women are the N. word of the world [noise]\nAnd I do not make this out [noise] but first of course [noise] decision by [noise] Susan Collins [noise] to vote for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh [noise] demeans unless they meteor hits the earth\nTomorrow Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed as the next justice of the Supreme Court now [noise]\nI Want to say something to those of you\nWho have no problem saying all women should be believed all men should not be believed\nFor those of you who felt that it's perfectly OK\nTo accuse somebody who's had up until now impeccable reputation of a sexual assault without any corroborating witnesses corroborating evidence\nThere is not to say I never have said and I defy you to find when I have said that Dr Christine Blasey Ford has a liar I never said that I Do think something happened to her\nIt's not my job to determine what happened to her though it's my job to determine whether or not\nWe have we have fairness here and as Susan Collins pointed out this is not a jury trial so it's not a standard beyond a reasonable doubt but certainly got to be more likely than not which is what she said\n\nAnd given his reputation given the number of women that have voucher his reputation given that nobody's ever made a kind of allegation before given that he's now undergone seven background checks given that the four people stopped forward say where they're all say they have no recollection of it\nThat does not meet the standard of more likely they are not\nFor those of you who were\nYelling and screaming berating people like breathing Senator Flake look at me look at me look at me\nFor those of you who believe that just because I'm applying this more likely than not standard therefore I Believe that Dr Ford is lying that believe a sexual abuse harassment and assault or not serious problems in America we haven't been listening\nFor those of you who took up on this issue not really so much because you're concerned about the issue because you want to stick it the Trump\nBecause as I told you the primary reason that people are afraid about Kavanaugh is because they believed to overturn roe v Wade\nNow listen to me very carefully\nSomehow some way this country function until Nineteen Seventy three with every individual state determining its laws on abortion\nIn states like New York California in fact in states where Seventy percent of the population resides had an abortion pretty much on demand\nAnd there's no reason to believe that if and when Ravi way where to be overturned in a matter of goes back to the states\nThe landscape would shift in a sort of dramatic way right now in conservative states you will not be able to find an abortion doctor they'd been shamed out of business\nAnd in ... states if for all the way we're overturn what makes you think the state legislatures would suddenly enact anti abortion laws given their unpopularity in those states so in the real world\nNot a whole lot with change now how and why Ravi way became known as a quote right to abortion case it's beyond me\n\nAnd if you look at the LA Times article not Fox\nThat Breitbart National Review came out a few years ago\nAbout the opening of the papers of justice black man he was we sign erode the author of the decision and he thought was going to be a very narrow decision he thought that the decision on whether or not women should have an abortion was a medical decision one that should be made by doctors\nAnd he almost issued a warning that the this is an art not be ... be construed any other way she was talked out of it\n\nAnd so for those of you who have turned this into a man gets woman thing just because everything that you dislike and Donald Trump\nEverything he does everything he says you're going to attack it because you think evoke or because you think he's a big hit because you think he's a racist because you think this because you think that\nGets wet approval ratings are up he's now a fifty percent according to Rasmussen gift what the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans used to be ten points just about a week or two ago is now plus two and favorite Democrats\nGuess what the attack\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh [noise] the fact that some leftist have refer to him as a attempted rape is for a serial rapist included a backlash\nAnd the backlash is going to motivate Republicans even when Kevin gets on because you've already signal that you intend if you take over the house to open up a piece in investigations so I'm urging Republicans not to let their guard down just because\nKevin ... is likely to be confirmed in for those of you who feel very strongly the other way\nAnd feel that just a referendum against women that it means that you don't believe women I mean she's not taking a rape and abortion what rape and sexual assault and things like that seriously you haven't been listening I Know you're just like this\nBut one of the reasons Donald Trump got elected is because he promised to nominate judges that would follow the constitution this is now the second one and God willing and the creek don't rise\nAnd he gets re elected he may have one or two more so for all of you who are very very unhappy about this I Want to say this very sincerely\n[laughter]\n\n\n\nSo are you know you\nKnow you try [noise]\nCorner Ted Cruz restaurants as safe as restaurants\nGo with my wife they were ... and you feel lost\n[noise] I've got a bite [noise] some dirt on to get back to the game [noise] holiday sales are all through all\nAs Carl is with speaking she spoke almost half hour she started out very slowly and you didn't know where she was going to go kind of built up to it [noise]\nYou could see the screen and the bottom right the there were two women that were in the forefront and you could just tell they weren't happy the way the same with going and they put their hand over their head when she began to wrap up when you can tell she was going to vote to confirm Kavanaugh they just looked destroyed\nAnd as I'm watching them and I'm listening to call and I said did you hear anything she said\nWith with what she said unreasonable none of it made any sense to you don't you care about how she ... got to her position she said she spent\nMore time on this went over hundreds of cases a was a brief to she said I think once a week by some a group of legal experts so she can understand what this was all about\nAnd she very carefully went over Christine forced testimony and very sensitive Lee said as I said before that uh that she believed her she believes something happens before we can assign what happened to her to Kevin Oh there's got to be fairness\nAnd while this is not a criminal trial and therefore you don't apply to standard of beyond a reasonable doubt into a moral certainty certainly it's got to be at least more likely than the nod and she went over the evidence in such a name for people\nWho she claims were were there and the four people either have no recollection of it or say they weren't there now now what do you do with that\nAnd ... also said that the person who who took her to the party or or or brought her back a has never shown up she got home somehow she didn't fly she didn't say that about didn't fly I added that but um she got home somehow and whoever it is we got her home never came forward and told us who he or she was\nAnd so given the background of having all the reputation of Kavanaugh all the women that are supported him all the women he's worked with with no allegation\nAnd we're going to deny him the seat on the Supreme Court because a woman who cannot corroborate her claim of doesn't really know the year doesn't really know where does know how she got that it's not how she got back didn't tell anybody\nShe said that just doesn't fast past the fundamental fairness tests and everything she said it was reasonable she's a moderate but the women in the bottom right hand corner apparently weren't listening or have turned it off or felt that\nSomehow it didn't make any sense I mean did you hear what you had to say does not matter that you wanted\nPeople to think

Lindsey Graham debate has a new favorite moderate Republican\n[noise] she she didn't really find charm\nKirk how is it that the Democrats can look at the FBI reporting conclude that there was no cooperation and excuse me Republicans can include there's no cooperation of the allegations made by Dr Ford\nAnd the Democrats and look at the same report and say that there's all sorts of evidence of misconduct in the Kavanaugh report let me play Cory Booker for you the\nSenator from New Jersey the one is very likely going to run for president\nWell first of all I mean those characterizations for me or\nA bad about that just ... trading a sham on the American people because there are clearly a many witnesses\nOr people that could have cooperated or what ... said\nPeople that were eyewitnesses what Mr America they weren't even interview but I just want to take you to that room for a second uh the whole process was to me again I'm a what's considered a young senator here ah for just five years but I just never seen anything like it we were shuttled and there were about\nA dozen Democratic senators and our first shift we were given an hour to go through the papers be literally only had one copy so we were reading together and you're like ... ... ... very conservative Democrats all the way to more liberal or progressive Democrats\nCook so that Cory Booker here's a Bob Corker from Tennessee\nThere's absolutely zero ... ah cooperation with zero cooperation to any of these allegations are mounting obviously it makes people feel really good coming out of there Kirk\nZero cooperation or the or the Democrats are saying that there's all sorts of stuff or in the FBI report and stuff that they should have a track down but didn't\n[noise] they don't want anybody to believe that it illegitimate reports on what they run into I don't know what the heck are investigating but on the side I guess\nThey say that they should have interviewed her initiative interview Brett Kavanaugh or you just got listeners\nWe're not going to cook\nWhen you were you surprised about Heidi Heitkamp she's a senator from North Dakota she voted in favor of Gorsuch and she'd behind by double digits in her race in a state that Trump carried overwhelmingly and I thought she was going to be a yes vote but she voted no\nParty line I guess she's writing off or you know I really don't know [noise] Democrats were almost to a man it was only one Democrat they're voting for him or if I'm correct\nYeah it looks like Joe Manchin will but here's what Heidi Heitkamp said Joe Manchin from ah West Virginia\nBut the one thing that I learned from that experience\nWas really that the most important thing you can tell a victim\nIf you in fact do is that you believe them\nAnd I believe I'm a doctor for I Believe her story and I think it is critically important that the message gets sent to women and girls and and people across this country that um when you believe that um\nThat you should sad and and that that begins that process have really exploring and revealing I'm a ... the changes that we need to make in this society and I know that's a lot of people would say well you know this has been exaggerated I think that if you really sit down with most women\nAnd even in the state of North Dakota and talk to them many have personally been victims\nOr they know someone who's been a victim or they have it\nThe author or a a granddaughter who has been victimized by sexual assault and and I think that\nMy my belief that a doctor Ford is telling the truth leads me to the conclusion that I have to vote no on judge Kavanaugh\n...\n[noise] well [noise] I don't think you're helping women caused by you know what the ... just kind of a story and you don't you're going to be neat proof you straight and if you really want to make a dent in this you got it right away to\nGet women to go to court to please\nAnd go with evidence and let's get their strengths rentals you can trade from

that happens you know we forget about the Iraq War that the most recent Iraq War when that happened and people got into the basis of their leaders that is part of a democracy and that's what makes us America so I say shame on those lawmakers\nFor speaking to those women like that they should encourage them to dialogue and maybe the engaged them in a conversation and listen they wouldn't\nHave to

cooperation I'd be the first one out there I'm Still reading through the documents\nHad more time to go through it\nAgain I I just don't know anybody in America had over a hundred and fifty people ask questions about 'em over Twenty years and then as soon as raised corroborated any of this and so we have to operate based on that but I'm not done reading the documents okay\nDid you get a chance to read Brett Kavanaugh's op ed in New York Times\nUh no I didn't\nKnow he said the basically apologize for uh for the outburst for a saying that this is a revenge and the Clintons and about the left are

issue\nAnd it specifically related to the topic that brought it up and it turned out that I'm Kevin I was guilty about something and then was not contrite no he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court I

one S. A. G. E. triple eight nine seven one Seventy four three Larry Elder relief factor dot com studio in New York attorney general says the Trump Foundation engaged in quote persisted illegality\nIn the quote former ACL EU leaders have blasted an appalling anti Brett Kavanaugh add their word appalling not mine they say the ACLU as straight from his mission\nAnd become taken over by left is pursuing it left wing as opposed to a civil libertarian agenda\nBette Midler caused an uproar unhappy about the Brett Kavanaugh hearings feeling that Dr Christine Ford was not given enough time [noise] tweeted women are the N. word of the world\n[noise] and I do not make this man but first of course [noise] decision by [noise] Susan Collins [noise] to vote for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh [noise] that means the less the meteor\nHits the earth tomorrow Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed as the next justice of the Supreme Court now [noise] I Want to say something to those of you\nWho have no problem saying all women should be believed all men should not be believed for those of you who felt\nThat it's perfectly OK to accuse somebody who's had up until now impeccable reputation\nOf sexual assault without any corroborating witnesses corroborating evidence\nAnd that's not to say and I never have said and I defy you to find when I have said that Dr Christine Blasey Ford is a liar I've never said that I Do think something happened to her it's not my job to determine what happened to her though it's my job to determine whether or not\nWe if we have fairness here and as Susan Collins pointed out this is not a jury trial so it's not a standard beyond a reasonable doubt but certainly got to be more likely than not which is what she said\n\nAnd given his reputation given the number of women that have voucher his reputation given that nobody's ever made a kind of allegation before given that he's now undergone seven background checks given that the four people Dr Ford say where they're all say they have no recollection of it\nThat does not meet the standard of more likely than not\nFor those of you who were\nYelling and screaming berating people migrating Senator Flake\nLook at me look at me look at me\nFor those of you who believe that just because I'm applying this more likely than not standard therefore I Believe that Dr Ford is lying that believe a sexual abuse harassment and assault or not serious problems in America we haven't been listening\nFor those of you who took up on this issue [noise] not really so much because you're concerned about the issue because you want to stick with the Trump because as I told you the primary reason that people are afraid about Kavanaugh is because they believe you overturn roe v Wade\nNot listen to me very carefully\nSomehow some way this country function until Nineteen Seventy three with every individual state determining its laws on abortion\nIn states like New York California in fact in states where Seventy percent of the population resides had an abortion pretty much on demand\nAnd there's no reason to believe that if and when roe v Wade or to be overturned in a matter of goes back to the states\nThe landscape would shift in a sort of dramatic way right now in conservative states you will not be able to find an abortion doctor they'd been shamed out of business\nAnd in liberal state if all the way we're overturn what makes you think the state legislatures would suddenly an act anti abortion laws given their unpopularity in those states so in the real world\nNot a whole lot what change now how and why Robie way became known as a quote right to an abortion case it's beyond me\n\nAnd if you look at the LA Times article not Fox\nAt Breitbart National Review came out a few years ago\nAbout the opening of the papers of justice black man he was re signer of the author of the decision and he thought I was going to be a very narrow decision he thought that the decision on whether or not women should have an abortion was a medical decision one that should be made by doctors\nAnd he almost issued a warning that the decision not to be construed any other way she was talked out of it\n\nAnd so for those of you who have turned this into a man gets woman thing just because everything\n\nThat you dislike and Donald Trump\n\nEverything he does everything he says you're going to attack it because you think evoke or because you think he's a bake it because you think he's a racist because you think this because you think that\nI guess what takes approval ratings are up he's now at fifty percent according to Rasmussen guess what the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans used to be ten points just about a week or two ago is now plus two in favor of Democrats\nGuess what the attack\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh effective some leftist have referred to him as a attempted rape is or a serial rapist excluded a backlash and the backlash is going to motivate Republican even when Kavanaugh gets hard\nBecause you've already signal that you intend if you take over the house to open up a piece when investigations so I'm urging Republicans not to let their guard down just because\nKevin ... is likely to be confirmed for those of you who feel very strongly the other way and feel that just a referendum against women that it means that you don't believe women means you're not taking a rape and abortion what rape and sexual assault and\nThings like that seriously you haven't been listening I Know you're just like this\nBut one of the reasons Donald Trump got elected because he promised to nominate judges that would follow the constitution this is now his second one\nAnd God willing in the creek don't rise and he gets re elected he may have one or two more so for all of you who are very very unhappy about this I Want to say this very sincerely [laughter]\n\n\n\nSo are you are you\nCorner Ted Cruz the restaurant is safe to\nWith my wife and they were ... and you feel lost [noise]\nI've got to fight for some dirt on to get back to the game [noise] paltry\nI watched it on Fox Fox had a little box in the lower right hand corner of a of people who appear to be in the hallways of maybe Congress holding up signs anti Kevin outside we believe for we believe her and as\nCarl is with speaking she spoke almost half hour she started out very slowly and you didn't know where she was going to go kind of built up to it [noise]\nYou could see the screen and the bottom right the there were two women that were in the forefront and you could just tell they weren't happy the way the same with going\nAnd they put their hand over their head when she began to wrap up when you can tell she was going to vote to confirm Kavanaugh and they just looked distraught it ended up watching them\nAnd I'm listening to call and I said did you hear anything she said\nWith with what you said unreasonable none of it made any sense to you\nDon't you care about how she ... got to her position\nShe said she spent more time on this one over hundreds of cases a was a brief did she said I think once a week by some a group of legal experts so she can understand what this was all about\nAnd she very carefully went over Christine forced testimony and very tentatively said as I said before that uh that she believed her she believes something happen before we can assign what happened to her to Kevin Oh there's got to be fairness\nAnd while this is not a criminal trial and therefore you don't apply their standard of beyond a reasonable doubt into a moral certainty certainly it's got to be at least more likely than not and she went over the evidence in such a name for people\nWho she claims were were there and the four people have no recollection evidence that they weren't there now now what do you do with that\nAnd ... also said that the person who who took her to the party or or\nOr brought her back a has never shown up she got home somehow she didn't fly shouldn't say that about didn't fly I added that but um she got home\nAnd whoever it is who got her home never came forward and told us who here she was and so given the background of having all the reputation of Kavanaugh all the women that have supported him all the women he's worked with\nWith no allegation\nAnd we're going to deny him the seat on the Supreme Court because a woman who cannot corroborate her claim doesn't really know the year doesn't really know where does know how she got that it's not how she got back didn't tell anybody\nShe said that just doesn't fast past the fundamental fairness tests and everything she said was reasonable she's a moderate but the women in the bottom right hand corner apparently weren't listening or have turned it off or felt that\nSomehow it didn't make any sense I mean did you not hear what you had to say does not matter that you wanted people to think through I thought you wanted to be an FBI investigations that you have more confidence that Dr Ford allegation had been thoroughly bet if you weren't even listening [noise] we when we come back though I'm Larry Elder\nLarry Elder all through all the [noise]\nNine
