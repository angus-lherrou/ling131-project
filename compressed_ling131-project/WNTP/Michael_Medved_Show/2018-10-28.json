happens is little seedlings are the weeds are able to finally grow their roots to them\nYou know that's what happens at first is that they grow a top she'd but they don't grow roots and if you go through a ... a normal a period of of moisture that sale quarter mil works great when it dies sopping wet the the little root system finally has the ability to throw down and start growing\nYou'll still get the fertilizer value out of it but you may you know get the pre emerging value\nAnything else can be done this time of year\nWell the only thing you can do besides that is if you have some
