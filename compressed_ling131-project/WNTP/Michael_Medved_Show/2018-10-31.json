and more coming up with your calls on the man that show [noise]\nAnd go oh for sure and then that coursing right now there are politics [laughter] some thing that is um [noise] I think what\nWe need to understand it not just about right or if it's not just about political points about football I think people's lives are now on the line and going back to the Republican Party in going back to travel\nAnd it's just the three men in Kansas for convicted of trying to bomb Somali refugees and they said in court that chronic anti Muslim rhetoric helped to influence that decision to take

that all Americans should be proud of it's not just a Republican achievement\nBut there's a new ad frankly that that was run by the Trump reelection campaign those this is not the Republican campaign committee [noise] this is the Trump twenty twenty election campaign and the ad is one of the best Republican ads I've ever seen I really mean it\nIt hits exactly where this problem came to order which is why is that right now the places where\nRepublicans are facing the stiff as challenges are privileged suburbs places that have done very well that are earning lots of money lots of new jobs lots of new businesses lots of new construction of those places that are doing so well why\nAre people in those communities leaning against Trump and yet in down crowd and communities in places in the mid west in in rural America and small town America that really have suffered recently and haven't yet partake in fully of the new prosperity\nThat's where Republicans are doing well have the party's

all crying every one answers to someone on the song sounds\nLike this Barbra Streisand's newly released song [noise]\nWhat can you\nMe a little true\nTo\nOkay um it it goes on like that here here's a question\nAnd I know that the music business is changing and people are listening to music on Spotify and download something and you can listen to it once and then throw it away but the core of the music business for a very very long time and I say a long time\n[noise] ah oh going on two hundred years I mean really for a very long time okay a hundred and fifty years the um the music business has been about getting music that you want to keep\nAnd listen to and enjoy\nAnd um I you know this again last night um I came home I went to see a new film which we're going to review on friday with my wife\nAnd we came home from the film and then we were doing some work and I know we're ready to go to bed and I just had a again a to hear this particular very obscure piece of music\nAnd I I collect CDs I have a lot of a compact is and um\nAnd and so I was able to find this a Russian folk songs by ... totally Riyadh off [laughter] it's a very obscure piece of music and I want to share with Diane 'cause she didn't know it and so I put it on even though I Am and listen to the CD for a long time so I'm Glad to have it because it's beautiful music can anyone imagine\nWhat it said two years from now I say\nTen years from now where President Trump is no longer president he's term limited don't worry liberals he's term limited\nWhat some of them want to put on this song don't lie to me about President Trump to hear more of this can you imagine sitting down in your living room in the middle of the night and saying yeah let's let's share the the musical experience of candles\nYou don't see the ball\nI I think that they the Democrats should employee this song in campaign of it [noise]\nUh no I meant the Democrats should because that would absolutely ensure that people are in the right mood of despair and\nI see I don't get this I don't get it and look I I I knew Barbara Streisand years ago I actually worked with her at\nOne point and by the way she's a very nice person she is not a mean evil nasty person at all or she has kind she's considerate and I think most people who have had any experience dealing with her on a personal basis I Will tell you that\nAnd it's sad for me to see this\nAnd and I'll tell you why I I I Know that Barbara has serious aspirations as an artist but somebody ought to tell her somebody ought to tell everybody on the left there is no lasting art there is no art of lasting value that has created for the politics of the moment\nDo you do okay honestly because it has a very\nShort shelf life\nOn the campaign songs that various people right or not songs of people turned two years later\nAnd frankly you can think of things uh like a blowing in the wind is blowing in the wind had a general political meaning but it wasn't specific like this aimed at one candidate or another\nAnd if you want to create music that really can do what music can do at best wishes to nourish the soul and maybe uplift the country wouldn't it be useful if the left would get off this this is\nIncredibly hard isn't one sided perspective she's asked an important question by the New York times of question was what do you say to those people\nWho maybe your fans who may love you're singing may love your work\nBut also loved Donald Trump for answers kind of astonishing and very sad [noise] we will get to that with your calls coming up\nThen later she she says in the interview she blames Donald Trump or making her fat\nI'm not joking\nVia the interview concludes with Meg ... asking Barbara how are you feeling these days and she says I Want to sleep nights if we take the house I'll be able to sleep a little bit better\nAnd then make gamers innocent and if they don't\nDon't know I've been thinking about do I want to move to Canada I think she'd promise to move to Canada before if Trump won the election I mean the presidential election and that she says I don't know if I moved to Canada I'm just so saddened by this thing happening in my country it's making me fat\nI hear what he said now and I have to go eat pancakes now and pancakes are very fattening we make them with healthy flower though I'm and flour coconut flower okay good for her ... does anyone think it's fair to blame Donald Trump for making you\nFat that's what she said ah\nLet's go to Jeff in Seattle Jeff you're on the Michael ...\nMichael ... the the whole bomb thing going out\nWith Trump saying you know fake news is evil or why are they the new people in the left as missing opportunity where there for trying to trying to put a face to the people who exactly are the lawyers who is the fake news is that\nLike Lawrence O'Donnell is if people on Rachel Maddow is Don Lemon is that the guys most you know you see is that a lot of people you know they need they need a fortune to name these people who thinks is lying\nHe he won't she won't because frankly he doesn't watch fake nose as he sees that he ... and you've heard the stories about how we only allows Fox News on air force one inning apparently got into a bit of a tiff with millennia because he called her watching CNN\nOr why cording to according to Don and when I watch all of them you know listen to try and was a little bits and pieces all of them are good dogs I mean you know he says that dog he watches\nHis show but my issue is is they need to try and force them to say who are these people people can come out and say I you know who is\n... ... again I I I'll tell you I think you actually I understand what you're saying and I I Do believe that President Trump would gain\nA lot by inviting some of the people who have been most critical to him becoming a White House sit down and talk it out it's a it it actually would make you look so different\nBut but the polarization are and to the extent that President participates in it [noise]\nI I think he's hurting himself will give another example\nOf coming right out [noise]\nListen live anywhere in the W.

Barbra Streisand and about her comments\nIn her in her interview uh that she doesn't care about what Trump supporters feel and she has her Trump fans of Barbra Streisand it might also be trumps borders the whole thing is too bad and it's an example\nOf everything that's wrong about this moment of polarization the I'm a ... interview have you ever met Trump\nAnd she says no but when I was editing my last TV special for Netflix and we were looking at audience shots there he was sitting next to\nBarbara Walters\nBut he never came backstage to see me or meet me\nSo I've never met him I keep a President Trump takes debate invite her to the White House disarm her\nShe she writes she speaks in this interview very movingly about Bob Dole she said the most terrible things about bombed or when he was running for president she speaks very warmly about McCain now that he's gone um she said awful things about McCain when he was running against\nThe bronco bomber but seat honestly the face to face with people and I've never met Trump but I have heard from people who know him that he is actually a very\nDifferent kind of person in person than you would think and uh\nThere's there's no reason to allow this this kind of insanity to continue it in her new album the album is called walls and I'm Maggie Haberman writes Barbara Streisand has a new album one that is the musical and bought him a diverse angel or disliked of President Trump boy I Want to buy that\nLoves to get an album this in a ... a singular\nDislike and the rare instance of her political views entering her music and not so rare one track already released don't lie to me as a direct address or fell her native New Yorker who\nNovels the oval office there are similar messages throughout the album walls which has released on friday can't wait\nAnd uh he shares a basic all the people say on the other side they say well but it says subject to the jurisdiction there of the reason they included that is they want it to exclude the children of ambassadors people who had a clear affiliation with a another country\nAnd all by by that context I think that they could say that someone who was growing up as a citizen of another country or somebody who is left the United states and live the rest of his life in\nSomewhere else okay you exclude that person but to try to go after now people whose parents were not us citizens of the United states are not here legally the undocumented\nIs clearly a loser and there's a great great editorial today in the wall Street Journal making that point the real point about this is that\nThere is neither political will no judicial will\nTo do this or to have a constitutional amendment to change birthright citizenship President Trump is on very strong ground when it comes to resisting the caravan very strong ground\nAnd virtually all Republicans in nearly all Americans agree with that nobody wants to throw the door is open to everybody nobody wants to remove borders\nI shouldn't say nobody but very very few and just a fringe of the Democratic party\nAnd to stand on that principle the idea that we have to have an immigration system that works that's the kind of thing you can win\nThe or by the way they they did some fake news today on CNN or they said that well and in order to change the constitution the president would have to get two thirds of both houses of Congress and two thirds of the states that's not true he would need to get two thirds of the house two thirds of the Senate and three quarters of the states it is not\nPossible birthright citizenship is not going to change 'em\nIf Mr Trump wants to end the practice as the wall Street Journal and again nothing new York Times of Wall Street journal which had been very supportive of President Trump generally\nTo Mr Trump wants to end the practice sometimes called birth tourism\nHe can always draft and campaign for a constitutional amendment but Congress is unlikely to agree and pass a law much less than an amendment to the constitution\nTo is making this futile gesture of an executive order a week before election day Mr Trump made a political mistake this year by not trading legal status to adult immigrants brought here illegally as children for more border security\nThan Republicans good run on an immigration accomplishment and steady one of the political issue and will ... will soon see how well that worked but here's my basic point about this politically I don't think there's anyone who was excited by President Trump saying\nHe's going to address birth tourism who wasn't already supporting President Trump who wasn't already supporting a Republican and getting people excited over this by the way I Do think it would be possible to curb birth tourism\nBy enacting some legislation around it saying that in special circumstances where people are traveling to the United states not for the purpose of long term residency but simply to give birth to a child\nHere in the United states then you can question whether that child really is in the jurisdiction of the United states and that's okay but generally to challenge the idea that a child\nBorn to someone who has lived here\nFor ten years\nAnd uh where the child grows up entirely in the United states who want to try to challenge the citizenship status of that individual why not make more citizens who are actually committed to this country\nAnd so make sure that there is some kind of commitment or naturalization if need be but uh if there is any down for the parents but creating a process where people can go through American innovation\nIt seems to me is much better than obliterate in the idea of citizenship as some Democrats seem to want to do or the idea of changing the constitution\nTo change the status of people who were born here whose parents may not have had the right to come here in the first place and we'll be right back on the ... show I'd go to some of your calls coming up the

this is your decorations for a holiday that lets you bet that there's death admits that there is a sort of a scary side to the the season changing into a dark and coal time of year\nAnd I don't think

and I know exactly where you're talking about a sweetie I mean there's a skeleton hanging from the tree I'm ... I don't see anything positive in that what's what's why is that a a a sort of a benign or worthwhile influence\nBut I wouldn't say that it wasn't that worthwhile influence I think it's an expression of a holiday but it's universally understood to be secular to be fun to be different from the rest of the holidays which are more I'm upbeat\nAnd I don't think that it's meant to give the neighbors a negative message at all and and I don't think it's injected into the culture I think the culture is embraced Halloween and sales for the holiday have increased every year because of the fact that it's an escape\nIt keeps it takes us out of the horrors that grace the newspaper front page it let that go into the world a fantasy that left as\nI Do think that are fun like bobbing for Apple I mean there are things that happened on Halloween that are the hell I remind us and the harvest reminders this time of year and that's a positive of the holiday\nOkay what's the last time you have seen a what people would call an appropriate movie Halloween a scary movie\nYou're asking me I don't go to scaring\nThe I don't want them at ... the last thirty five years like\nScary movies that are about other topics too you know that's just spent and slaps that attract considered pretty scary and ah violence in nearly every movie the only ones that I go to a rom coms\nI I understand but since you're so particular about movies I mean it's kind of how it is\nNot a celebration of scary stuff how Halloween celebration where kids go out in the neighborhood and they see each other all dressed up and make but face paint on and they can put out a bag and say trick\nOr treat aged paying homeowners willing willingly Oprah turn on their way of great pain had the candy face paint\nYou're you're not making a

Halloween\nA a let's go to a a\nTessa in snow Paul me Washington You're on the Michael ... show hello Tessa\nHi Michael I think that's ridiculous to the here and say that the kids are learning to panhandle during Halloween I mean you can say that for every holiday that's out there couldn't less you're asking him to sit on a strange man's lap Easter you're sitting here telling them take food off the ground\nFourth of July you're telling them it's OK to set things on fire [laughter] well I think that the selling or go to the hearing said that panhandling is what we're teaching kids at that time\nWell accent out except most people generally in the in the rest of the year you would occasionally sit on somebody's lap and uh you would occasionally like different things on fire I don't know any other occasion and die You're welcome to jump in here\nAny any other occasion where you come up to people you may or may not know and a holdout a bag and expect them to put some good bird\nThough it's generosity between neighbors you're sitting here having an open and fun time and you know\nKids that are younger obviously do it under supervision and then what the older kids I'd rather have my teenagers go trick or treating than going out in the neighborhood and causing trouble ... things like that that's my only\nThing that makes this day difference is that one day set aside universally recognized as a time of being appropriate to go in the neighborhood\nWe all recognize it together it that we expect to have kids knocking on the door asking for candy it's not a big surprise where he just jumping in front of the door and say give me your handy it's something that we all choose to do and we choose to participate in and those are down to just turn off the porch light\nLet's go to
