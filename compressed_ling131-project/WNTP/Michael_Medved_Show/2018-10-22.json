feel that the Saudi Arabia's much worse than he ran so I'm\nIn a nutshell 'cause we don't have a lot of time please react to my theory or my belief that he ran as much worse than Saudi Arabia because he ran is a far greater danger\nTo the west and to Israel and Saudi Arabia is which is a danger more to itself although I fully acknowledged the Saudi contribution to a fundamentalist awful madrassas around the world so on what grounds do you think otherwise\nThe group that it nine eleven was from Saudi Arabia the um the money you know what they want to I Want her to come from Saudi Arabia to\nYeah okay I don't know I don't know what rumors of that would have been in Saudi Arabia was not prices\nAre now that we're not going to that's what they were pro going against Iran Syria\nYeah on your novel that comes from are you not know that that was a massive amount of weapons that were given job they do it that way or that the Saudi Arabia\nCNN and everywhere and mainstream media [noise] President Trump's approval rating\nIs the highest it's ever been\nOkay don't get too excited is forty seven percent\nBut forty seven percent to forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually closed the gap between disapproval on approval is now basically tied the Americans or even evenly split\nAnd one of the things that I found stunning I Am by the way in the midst of a battleground talkers tour I'm tonight in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise]\nAh and ah then on Thursday I'll be home God willing in between and on Thursday I'm going to be in Minneapolis where there are also some very hot congressional races and governor's races and Senate races and more\n[noise] but right now is all so tight your vote really really matters [noise]\nOne of the things that I've found stunning is that um I was watching CNN in the airport when\nTo change planes about six this morning in Washington DC I flew from Seattle, Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh and um [noise] in the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair\nAnd uh they showed in the new numbers about Trump soaring approval rating\nAnd I've asked them why and he had no idea she couldn't answer it\nAnd the answer is very obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nIs a um and most Americans like the economic situation we're in President Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people the economy is the most important part of the job\nA meanwhile with an election this close vote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there's a new book that suggests that it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening\nAnd uh [noise] there is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana\nWe did um [noise] a segment on the show\nA couple of weeks ago about a a a guy who said look I'm just a normal I'm middle aged a stay at home dad\nWho almost ruined his life through marijuana addiction\nAnd this individual by the way is for legalize marijuana\nIs going to be joining us on the show to tell his story and to answer your questions and to take your comments that all coming up on the Michael med betcha one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIf you can answer the question that a Tom Perez could not answer why President Trump's approval rating would be going up so dramatically the last couple of weeks [noise]\nHonestly part of it as the Kavanaugh situation part of it is the caravan situation anybody here who thinks that we shouldn't simply open the gate\nAnd as lead in all the people from the caravan\nThe even those of us who support him ... immigrants and immigration reform and I support immigrants but I support immigration reform\nThe idea of simply saying that uh you get seven thousand people together and they're marching to the United states and they're all waving Honduran flags well of course you let 'em in because they're having a tough time in Honduras or there are a lot of suffering people right\nBut the notion that that uh\nThat that somehow one of the Democrats said about this what is the right thing to do\nI think the right thing to do is to make it clear that before they walk the other two thousand miles they have left to walk before they get to the United states border they get a very very clear idea of a President Trump and most other Americans who actually can think about this with anything like an open mind\nAre going to say no this is not a good idea you don't simply a\nLet people into the United states without authorization without security clearances or then have them flood the system for processing asylum applications one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] meanwhile somebody who seems to have a position on everything\nBut I don't really think you have a position on the caravan because how could he [noise] he is a bad so O'Rourke\nAnd one of the questions I Would ask here\nIs what is so great about Beto he is he is now inspired people\nIs is the Democratic nominee for US Senate against Ted Cruz President Trump is going down to campaign for the guy he wants to call lie in bed and people say oh to Trump's such a hypocrite this happens in politics all the time\nPeople who were opponents to run against each other then come together and work together it happens all the time of Ronald Reagan and George ... a age W. Bush George W. Bush running in the primary against Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty\nAttacked him pretty harshly he said the Reagan was practicing voodoo economics and then later we embrace that Bhutto economics a Reagan chosen to be as vice president and uh\nThey honored and came to like each other or this is\nAll remarkable what\nIs going on that the election is so close but that hasn't stopped people from breaking into song\nOver the great Robert O'Rourke that's his real name known as bait so the Democratic wonder boy of this election cycle who was inspired melodies like this\nPasses God\nWay the guy is totally [noise]\nNo matter\nOn may do burn by turning ...\nNow and then they may\nBe feeling [noise] many\nMen no do you\nFeel a little bit a little a little bit [noise]\nOkay the last time I think that anyone sort of inspired this many songs are in a campaign was President Trump\nYou remember we spent several days playing the various Trump songs I like the one get on the Trump train 'em in any event the better our work and the the ex to see about that token someone explained to me\nWhat it is exactly that is so inspiring to people about Beto O'Rourke\n... what it is that the ... the soul and and makes people so excited that even though he is almost certainly going to lose his challenge to Ted Cruz who's been a decent hardworking senator and he's a conscientious and substantive conservative\nAnd by the way he knows so much more about the issues than Beto O'Rourke what is it that Beto O'Rourke is going to do for the country\nThat inspires reactions like this and and basically with ABC News telling him he's not just a candidate he's a rock star listen I'm\nObvious strategies that are more than a in a modern and very and we just literally show of everywhere\nYou can be without an interruption in from the federal factor much I Love your things you will you\nThere's so many\n\nOkay um [noise] or they're going to be a lot of disappointed folks in Texas are coming up on election day Fifteen days from now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number a President Trump\nHas his own response see as a new video out about uh the Democrats offering mom's not jobs or we will get to that and uh we will get to\nWhat the election comes down to there is also a a a very alarming peace in the New York times with at least is meant to be alarming I didn't think it sounded so bad\nIt's by David Leonhardt and is what if the Republicans when everything the fact that\nThe New York times even thinking about that that shows you which side has momentum at the moment we will be right back on the Michael ... that show with your calls [noise]\nWant to go you Ron Michael [noise]\nTwenty nine four five seven genes Seventy six\nMichael's visual [laughter] nine\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a bay toe performing and is a performance that sort of a performance art as they say when he was doing a town hall in or\nNear El Paso which is where he's from\nAnd you are very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise] and uh\nShe she asked him very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively\nThat it leads me to believe that\n[noise] no he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he rules out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that um [noise] and some other they might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race\nWas he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he is said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice in collusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nHe is for impeachment he he believes even before the smaller investigation as wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish but needs to fish but ... so he agrees with a lot of those people on the far right the deficit just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the time hey I appreciate your call um I I'm a I Will get back\nTo this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything will we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of them at least to sort of\nFlummoxed some of his age or there's talk about another tax cut\nThat may be announced before November first that soon and very soon a and he says it's people are going to love it it's going to be a big middle tax a\nFlat tax cuts middle class tax cuts and

give it to like him a call ... view about the uh the journalist uh we we uh there's\nMore to that and we really it's a it's not our country not our our our battle anywhere I called to talk about the uh the planned invasion\nYou are you calling the caravan of planned invasion\nYes sir\nWell eight Ito given the fact that we've had so far this year I think we've had about twenty times the number of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across and ah\nThis I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system is basically an attempt to raise the border and say that uh we have to let anyone that wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that in ... and say that\nSo [noise] but when you say in a planned invasion what do you have in mind\nUh I think it's just a part of the war or the battle between conservatives and left us that are trying to take down America\nAnd this is the latest strategy\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen ... and of\nCourse they play a lot of very close compassionate a video showing some of these poor people\nWho I think are hungry or scared I'm hopeful ah they they do not appear to be actors or manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I\nI think that President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and just say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country that's not going to be our immigration policy but I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatened to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why\nThe best way to prevent other incidents like this and so this doesn't happen every week or every month is not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras it's to\nCoordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people these seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now [noise]\nAnd to bring them back home where you can work with them to try to make Honduras a more livable place because that's really going to\nBe the only kind of answer that has a long term impact of let's go to Marco in Los Angeles Marco you're on the ... that show\nI might go a great job either way hey three things I was calling regarding that that the um the reporter that got killed I feel that that's really not our crime it lots of guys get killed all over the place we're not we're not up in arms about it\nFor sure it's a bad situation that happened but why are we getting involved country insolvent\nBecause we are and we are involved with the country I mean they the argument is we ah we have a lot of financial dealings with Saudi Arabia now of Saudi Arabia is not a country we give foreign aid to their one of the richest countries in the world\nBut it's a country that we have a lot of arms to him as President Trump says we have a pending one hundred ten billion dollar arms deal and if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from\nA China or Russia and I\nMean why does that have to do what does that to do with this guy can kill\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow um Mohammed bin Solomon the prince crown prince of Saudi Arabia got the idea that it was okay to kill reporters because President Trump is always so critical of the press\nAnd I think he ... obviously President Trump is never called on anyone to kill reporters\nAre and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference and it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte and one of the worst moments of his life losing his temper and slam slamming doing a body slam on a reporter he shouldn't be making jokes about that\nA let's uh go to Matt in Seattle Matt you're on the ... that show [noise]\nWe'll ... we'll we'll be right

I just wanted to ask you a day at the outset you eat your piece was actually scary and sad and very honest and how how many years did you feel that you had a problem with marijuana\nMe it's hard to gauge how many years I actually had a problem I I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades and I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it so a long time\nHow do you know you over did it\nWell now that I'm Silber I can look back on some of the uh the mighty have years when I was high and realize that uh\nThat pot was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having a public meltdown either Eric Cantor and even a getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also\nWas a sleeping normally I I was I was at ... and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time\nThinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume and about the consumers with about trips I could take that would revolve around marijuana and you know it just kind of became the center of my life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you you've been married for a while right\nI've been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was still you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right I beat I\nPublished a capital is ten bucks\nI had a couple of a script deals in Hollywood I you know I've written for you know pretty much every English language publication ... except for the New Yorker you know it's it's not like I I was a um an ambitious donor or a failure but I I sometimes wonder\nHow much more successful I Would have been if I hadn't been soaked in marijuana the whole time and I certainly would have a you know live my life is more integrity and and carried out my uh my business affairs with we made it more efficiently and I also just would have been able to devote more time to my family\nFor how long how long have you been sober a\nMy one year anniversary is November of level so I'm going to make it I'm pretty sure that uh relapses and coming before then so I'll just stay year\nOkay well good for you congratulations on that and what advantages do you see now that you're not smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of or go to want to buy because in some ways marijuana\nWas the creative force in my life I Would you know I I wrote almost all my book I all the time and I came although in retrospect there there's a lot of there are a lot of scenes in the novels that are about getting hot\nAnd I I think there will be fewer of those but you know I it it it helped me come up with certain like fancy indecent jokes\nUm and it was a creative stimulant in some ways but uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative since I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present for my family and my friends um I'm Better organized\nUm I I I Can't say I'm making more money but I feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that it wasn't his out as much chaos and ... and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nThat was happening when I was using marijuana you know I'm not I'm not super up all the time or and and then when I when I bought 'em out I don't bother them out there there's no there's no high or low like I said\nSo I'm not having those melt down that would characterize a sort of my my addiction cycle\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number ... speaking with Neal Pollack who wrote about how marijuana almost ruined his life you know one thing you you mentioned you've\nBeen married for Eighteen years [noise] did your wife ever share a your enthusiasm for a living you know and in\nFact you know she was just the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all\nUm and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I Would just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know 'cause the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive ... in some ways it's considered a health food um and so I\nI just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism in\nMy family um and obviously have the addiction gene I just did it it just didn't register with me\nUm maybe it should have you know they've always ducking behind the dumpster on the weight walking to the gym it's like you know take a hit like it'd be high wall of working out is that's not the signs of someone who is necessarily healthy but uh you know I just\nI ah I didn't see it she did and she she was so grateful when I finally made the decision to quit\nYou know I ... you use the figures in your in your piece that I I I think they're generally accepted figures from the journal of the American Medical Association and\nBased on studies done in a number of countries they suggest that uh some nine percent of people\nWhoever use marijuana end up getting addicted and Seventeen percent of people who use marijuana is teenagers did you first used a weight as a teenager\nYeah I smoked once at a party when I was in high school but you know when I was when I was a teenager and this was you know in the Nineteen eighties I was I was sort of a a\nGo getter do gooder student council type sort of a modeling myself maybe not politically but like at least in terms of my lifestyle on you know Michael J. Fox is character from family ties\nUh-huh I Know that was my model like I was going to a guy that I Would be successful\nI was going to be a great American citizens and um and so part didn't really play into it um you know college I got out of um\nI I went a little uh [noise] I I I I'm a member of generation X and so I you know I I I became kind of a a a grouchy pop culture cynic but I still wasn't doing a lot of drugs or it wasn't until I was in my twenties that I um that I really started a consuming it\nSo it was an adult onset addiction\nRight brain ... I had a view I'm ever tried to calculate how much money you invested in and buying lean over the years about\nOh I mean it was probably a few thousand dollars you know the the thing is it and you know and and this is is it a brag it's the fact you know I there was a time there where I was a ... you know well known writer and people would just give me drugs uh or or smoke me up and I I'm I'm I'm kind of some\nInherently cheap so I Would look for a situation where I ... I knew I'd be around people who would have it so I wouldn't have to buy but of course still with them you know when I Lived in LA\nI had a medical marijuana card out you know I go up to Colorado for a week and I spend a hundred two hundred bucks so it didn't bankrupt me in that sense but it you know it's still it was still even on a month where it was really good at ... was still caught me at least fifty dollars not a hundred bucks and I\nKnow you you you've written a since you've written this piece sentence obviously causing a great stir have you done some negative reaction from some of your old friends\nOh no people have been very supportive I've had a few people who wonderful go\nYeah yeah I mean generally when someone announces that they're an addict the reaction is that like you're faking it\nOr [laughter] you know you're ... it's not you know or or you're not an addict I mean if you\nIf you go through what if you go through the twelve step program guided ... there's no way you can anyone can say that you're not an addict I mean I wouldn't have done it if I was it but uh you know there was some sort of anonymous\nEmails and comments on line that that said that there is no way when I was describing could possibly be true but I was fictionalized thing that I was somehow working with reactionary forces who want to contribute to the drug war but those those comments were minor five percent most\nPeople were you make it you make it very clear in your in your column that you believe that\nMarijuana should be legal given the fact that you recognize that it's dangerous a that's a fascinating position to take we will get to that and much more with Neal Pollack\nLink to his website as well he's um um Britain a powerful piece about marijuana addiction will be right back with your calls for Neal Pollack coming up\nOne of these ones were signed by five seven genes Seventy six Michael mid visual [noise]\nHave to avoid that I was trying to fill\nFill a was marijuana we just kind of stumbled across each other but certainly the creative aspect that maybe a little bit more on the artistic side of the visuals side but I feel that\nIt's it's certainly a struggle and and my main question was what ... for the show was what finally made you quit\nYeah but that's a good question and to address the things you're saying is like just marijuana is kind of creeps up on you right it's not like I'm you\nKnow heroin where your job if you get addicted very fast I'm so ... you can use it for a number of years it's sort of a low level is gradually increases as for me that my moment of clarity game ... ironically enough\nNow that the Dodgers are back in the world series that actually came at the world series I ... I went to Los Angeles that always dreamed of going to a World Series game even though I didn't really have the resources to do it and I bought a ticket off of some ... third party Web site before I did that I managed to get as high as I possibly\nCould um even though you know there's no reason why you need to get hired and go to the world series but I needed to get high to do everything and that was a special occasion so I got really high\nUm smoking this huge joint that has all this crystallized th ... all over like smoking weed with a stranger and it has an echo park I went to the stadium\nBombed out on my mind and the ticket didn't scan it was it was like I said it was fraudulent 'em and rather than deal with the situation rationally I started screaming at people and I was on I almost got arrested I got it scored it out of the stadium\nOr by security guards I was in the parking lot sobbing and I just kind of took a look at myself into a side view mirror of a car and I just saw this you know old man with red rimmed eyes\nCrying over a baseball game and I just I thought to myself this isn't good I Can't go on like this and so I didn't quit that day but three weeks later I I feel kinda sunk in and I just had my last puff and\nKen Daniel around haven't vote can can you be around other people who were getting high uh use our would you go into the other room\n[noise] no I Can't I was at a music festival I live in Austin, Texas and I was at the Austin city limits festival a couple of weeks ago and I was hanging out with\nFriends who are smoking joints and puffing up at Penn I have a sign of poker out I was going to wear the ever which passes joined around the table that was the only one there wasn't stone I lost my view\n[laughter] well I I Wish you better luck with poker you've obviously had better luck with your life as Neal Pollack we've posted is information on our website when we come back\nMarijuana and driving\nA will deal with it coming up on the adventure\nWanting to resign by five seven genes Seventy six\nThis is the rule W.

accidents are rising in states that have already to legalize recreational marijuana\nThat follows dark warnings from the national Transportation Safety board which last week issued several recommendations to combat drug impaired driving and then Neal Pollack our guest wrote a piece for the drive where he says I'm\nPot is being touted as a cure for all human hills and as a negative effect so drastically underplayed but there is no greater negative to marijuana than driving stoned as dangerous as hell if you really think it's safe to drive stone then you've either never been stone have never driven or lying to yourself\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number [noise]\nUm I Neal these these numbers look look fairly serious and I think\nOne of the big claims when we were going through the legalization debate and the state of Washington where I live\nWas that this wouldn't be so great because fewer people will be drinking and more people will be smoking weed but for first of all there's no reason to believe that smoking weed stops people from drinking as they're\nAbsolutely not I mean I I was less of a drinker when I was getting stone but I Know I Know people who do both and in if they go together pretty well so no they didn't believe that\nBut there you know the thing with driving while stoned right there the other to live in the in this donor community that um it's actually a much safer to Dr stone than er than drunk because you know when you're stone you\nGet paranoid and you're more focused and you can get

race Tennessee in Texas the data show only in Nevada have democratic affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voters so far in early voting according to the data\nThis is um [noise] it was pretty dramatic now look every one of those states except for Nevada\n... is a Republican say there's the states that the Trump carry some of them may carry built by a lot however he didn't necessarily do it was early voting but when you're talking about Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee in Texas [noise] those are all states that Trump carried\nAnd uh however\nHe did these candidates in those states don't do do do better than Trump they just need to do as well and uh this would be very encouraging and it also brings up the point that when you read the generic polls nationally when they say well\nThe Democrats are have this big advantage and the generic poll [noise]\nThe reason that that doesn't matter as much as you might think it would be the same reason it didn't matter alternately that Hillary won the popular vote by more than three well three million votes but you know what that was all in California\nAnd that's the point one of the reasons I think that Democrats may be doing well on the generic ballot there are thirty six seats where there is no Republican candidate\nReally where it's just so like I I don't think Maxine Waters has a Republican candidate against are there other seeds that are so dominated by the Democratic machine no Republican runs you know how many seats there are no democratic candidates only three\nSo when you take that

the most important election of my lifetime\nAnd again everyone says that about every election and it's almost never true [laughter] really [laughter] and this is a midterm election and it it will not be a landslide one way or the other\nEnd yes I think it's important and yes I think everybody should definitely vote because this will help to determine the direction for the country for the next two years but then we have another presidential election and I think one of the things that happens is we're all so desperate to get people to turn out\nAnd then when an election happens and there isn't some kind of profound change\nHow people get disillusioned how often can you cry wolf about that stuff\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number a President Obama's successor was also speaking today and he had a a different tone he was speaking outside the White House and here's a President Trump said\n\nPutting in a resolution [noise] sometime next week a week and a half away from\nMiddle of the first says how old is your favorite [laughter] this is a bit of that sort of the fact that we've already [laughter] I Know\nThat there was a vote after the election\nOkay uh\nI'm not sure this is going to work and what he's talking about is\nI'm trying to do a ten percent middle class income tax cut sounds pretty good\nBut honestly I I don't think he will get the support he needs unless a and first of all he's right to say we're we're going to try to do the vote after the election when he's talking about now is a proposal to try to excite the Republican base in of course people should be excited about it that you know how much money you spend in taxes\nAnd getting ten percent of that back that's pretty cool that's a nice thing however\nHe can't do it honestly unless he finds some kind of compensating\nA place for money to come in\nBecause it simply does not work it does not work that when you cut the tax rate\nThat automatically the revenues go up I mean it's true that the revenues didn't go down from the last tax hike but because we're spending so much more than ... continue to grow up we're already looking at a trillion dollar a year deficit\nAnd I think the president should work as part of the can maybe after the election with a Republican House and a Republican Senate to try to yes continue to cut taxes\nBut to do so by cutting spending one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or in Nevada a President Trump spoke on Saturday and he was talking and somewhat similar terms listen\nLocated in a major factor\nReally people [noise] and we do that it'll be somehow I'm prior I Would say that have ever had are setting the really right now around the block they may actually got middle income people not at all your pay grade he's working on it [noise] All right we're we're all working\nAt a major\nSome time around the first survivor maybe a little bit further\nOkay one of the things that we need to keep in mind is they're already was a tax cuts for middle income people you may not be aware of it but you will and when you fill out your tax forms and everything because basically the exemption was doubled\nIn other words part of what we have now is that the standard deduction the standard deduction that people receive\nWas doubled which means that there's an extra twelve thousand dollars that people who are middle class taxpayers are not paying taxes on\nThat's a good thing and that should save a lot of money all ready for middle income people\nAnd uh I ... I think the timing of this I may be could be a little bit better\nAnd also President Trump did something that provoked a usually negative response on CNN [noise] what's striking about this is not the light it sheds because she has no light at all on President Trump's proposed actions concerning the federal government\nAnd trans gender is um\nWhat's shocking about it is supposed to be journalism and honestly these reporters on air or are sounding completely don't polish gently partisan I'm Talking about John Berman\nAnd um [noise] and I'll Alison ... and John Avalon on uh CNN listen to how\nThey react remember it was just over three years ago that same sex marriage became legal in this country\nSo now the wedge issue has moved to a trans Raj concerns I Love to mock the issue of butter or gender identity civilized by Facebook's dozens of gender options\nI'm also liberal is a race a myriad of gender pronouns for many conservatives in some moderate it's a potent example the PC culture the Trump constantly attacks to great effect\nRepublicans want to benefit from this backlash and it's an easy target just look at the numbers transgender folks makeup an estimated zero point four percent of American adults work once when I saw one million people\nThat do a lot of our fellow citizens but it's many fewer than the millions of gay and lesbian Americans for most people know was friends family your co workers\nAnd it's just simply picking on minority rights to try to win the popular vote last time I checked self determination was a pretty basic American values rooted in freedom and equality what President Trump has also been playing up the care about of asylum seekers from Central America\nPushing it as a threat at rallies and tweets with plenty of amplification from conservative media this is just more play the bass ... rooted in fear and anger rather than any reality that these asylum seekers are going to rush the border\nOkay there let's say they don't rush to the border\n[noise] what are they coming here to do they're they're coming here in Moscow to get into the United states and what they will do is flood our resources or submit applications for asylum\nAnd basically challenged this notion that the United states as a as a bad basically the core of our sovereignty\nGets to decide who comes into the country and who doesn't\nWe don't get to decide because we're not East Germany who leaves the country and people are free to leave\nBut this is this is bizarre this is um we have that can we go to this last uh ... uh we don't have time okay ah I ah I Know we will be speaking about this later frankly\nWhat President Trump is doing is not taking away anyone's rights what he's doing is taking away a federal government position I actually believe that the federal government's position on transgender ism I should be neutral and in other words don't persecuted people were transgendered but don't\nAll of a sudden presumptive leave claim that someone is a woman just because he says so or someone is a man just because she says so [noise]\nThat's ridiculous [noise] I'll tell you what's ridiculous the idea of stolen election [noise] we will get to that the real threat of voter fraud coming up on them in that show [noise] my\nNews now offering a special deal by one get one free go to my little dog dog\nUsually promo for politics the pop culture banned from coast to coast this is Michael ...

uh the state of Ohio had to fight source but it effort to do both those things right it was a Supreme Court decision was five to four but allow them to um continue to make sure that the people on the voter rolls were legal voters and then to be able to implement ID so those are those are cute commonsense\nThings I think states can do West Virginia's doing that\nGeorgia has done that as well so I think that's one thing um and then I think at the other day there needs to be some verification that people that are registered to vote or actually citizens because this is a very big problem and it's a problem by the way I don't think\nNecessarily that comes from a non citizens who just have this overwhelming desire to elect Democrats right it's not like illegal immigrants that around and they all
