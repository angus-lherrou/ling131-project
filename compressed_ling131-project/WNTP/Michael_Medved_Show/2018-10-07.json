they doing it or they're going to implant and they had been in planning so allegedly these tiny microchip Senate tons of electronic equipment being assembled in China\nDestined for America a story\nBy Bloomberg Businessweek reports Chinese military unit manufacture these micro trips as small as a sharp and pencil tests and some of the chips were built to look like thing no conditioning cup ... sin but inside incorporated memory and networking capabilities\nThan a lot of power for an attack that is amazing thing about this a chip the size of a pencil to it has all this and so anyway the\nTips were then inserted a Chinese factories that supplied super micro one of the world's biggest sellers or a mother boards when\nThe server was installed in switched on the microchip alter the operating systems car so that this would be part of an attack now excellent reporting a must read from Bloomberg Businessweek if you have the time do it but my favorite line and the Bloomberg story they're talking about a company by the name elemental\nAnd they sell servers okay are you ready for just listen to this line in a story\nTo of elemental biggest early clients were the Mormon church\nWhich use the technology to beam sermons to congregations around the world and the other big client is the adult film industry and they did not [laughter] [laughter] okay they didn't beams in conversations around the world thank you for that [noise]\nAll right I just love technology when it can have a positive effect on our lives and heart disease and stroke a church two of the biggest causes of deaths worldwide\nNow imagine for a moment that you can get a warning\nThat you are going to have a heart attack years before the event ever occurred that's right well\nThanks to technology developed by teams at Oxford University and institutions in Germany and the United states\nThey now are using algorithms to examine the fat surrounding coronary arteries as it shows up on the tea hard scams now most heart attacks are caused by a buildup of plaque fatty deposit inside the artery interrupts the flow of blood so currently the CAT scans\nTell a doctor when an artery has already become narrowed by plaque well that's the problem\nThey say now that they can figure this out even before develop they can say which arteries are the risk of narrowing they can say that your arteries are inflamed\nAnd what's going to be going on five years down the line that you should start preventive measures right now to avoid the platform for me so you can start singing are you ready don't go bake\nIn my heart [laughter] okay [noise]\nI actually thought that was funny [noise]\nAlright this next story is not for the kids so if you have kids that are listening to the came commando show time for them to cover their ears or you want to mute the television if you're watching the game commando show they're new to radio if they're in the room\nAs long as they're clear we're good to go or at your ready good there's a dark side of technology that a lot of folks are brushing off it's the use of robots for use then\nHow do you say intimate situation things that happened between two people\nJust like there are those gentlemen clubs where someone might pay ten dollars for a cold and send those ranchers branches in Nevada where prostitution is\nLegal the city of Houston was wrestling this past week with how to deal with a company that wants to open up a brothel filled with robotic sex toys that's right [noise]\nThey wanted to open a loved ... she was soon so that people would be able to use it human like dolls\nI kind of sad that it sounds familiar it was in that movie Westworld Houston remains the only major U.S city without zoning construction of the site for the proposed robot bravo had already be good\nBut it was stopped after the city inspectors visit location then they figured out that the business owners that they didn't have the proper permits\nSo Houston's city council actually updated a local\nAudience to specifically ban individuals from having sex with a device that resembles a human being [noise] okay I Know what you're thinking maybe the city council couldn't ferret away to tax the robots but those of us here at the Kim commando show\nA we have come up with the perfect name for that how about\nA Sears and Roebuck yes Sears and Roebuck yes okay [noise] okay the kids are back and let's talk about selfies research out this past week that death by selfie is on the rise an average of forty three people a year have died while taking selfies and\nThe year two thousand eleven drowning and falls are the biggest killers\nThe studies show that men account for seven to ten of these fatalities millennial daredevils those between the age of twenty twenty nine make up almost half of all sell the death so here's what's going on\nLegislation politicians are getting together and coming up with no selfie zones says right ... you're going to have no therapy zones near water bodies mountain peaks tall building\nA U.S woman died on a highway accident just seconds after uploading itself the of herself singing happy on her car stereo\nOr

of herself and her friend on the rail tracks British woman Louis\nShe's thirty seven her partner Michael thirty three they fell about sixty feet to their deaths after topping off a beach walls so now we need these no selfie zones or maybe it's just the latest crop of the Darwin Awards and we were just me\nAnd that's it but if you think about it on a positive way at least they had a recent had shot
