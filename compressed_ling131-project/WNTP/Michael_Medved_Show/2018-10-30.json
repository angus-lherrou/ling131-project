read about the fraud known as the ... study\nEyes that just a an attempt at humor [noise]\nOf we will get to the um [noise]\nThe the very relevant story of the Nazi Halloween are coming up it is hard to believe the president is due to land in Pittsburgh and\nA short while to help anticipate his visit a we'll be speaking with Lou Weiss who wrote a terrific piece of Wall Street journal yesterday he's the father of New York times writer Barry wise or he is a long time member\nWas a long time member of the tree of life synagogue which was struck by the terrorist attack\nWhat does he think of the president of the United states are coming to visit\nPittsburg at a time when there are some folks including the mayor who is not Jewish by the way the mayor of Pittsburgh saying uh know may be the president should not visit there a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nOr there is so much going on in this country right now to drive us apart\nAt a time when we really ought to be trying to come together and I think that some of what is driving us apart is naked and\nCheap and rather ineffective politics on all sides and\n[noise] just strange strange situation because at the same time that I think many many people feel frustrated with both sides of the political debate at the moment\nThere's evidence everywhere that the amount of interest in participation impassioned with this election is just rising\nAnd surging and may in fact set records\nAre there are elements of a recent stories that show obviously some of the worst in our country but there are also some stories that show the very best\nAnd one of those stories as it struck me and I'd like to begin with is before we talk to a ... from Pittsburgh\nIt's another story about Pittsburgh and about the way that this entire nightmarish attack was handled which is very very much to the credit of some of the participants ah there is a I'm\nA doctor who's the doctor in chief and in charge of the hospital to which the killer who is now\nBeing arraigned he's has twenty nine charges against him yes he faces the death penalty and I think that's\nAppropriate the um the doctor\nIn charge of the hospital introduced himself to Robert ... hours after he was brought in wounded and treated in the hospital\nAnd uh he had um a a a\nA very brief word that he delivered when he went in to look at the killer\nAfter he'd been treated here's what he told him he said I Am Dr Cohen\nAnd this after the killer had been brought into the hospital or screaming or I Want to kill all Jews I Want to kill all the Jews here here is that Dr Cohen his name is Jeffrey Cohen he is the president of the Allegheny General Hospital where some of the victims\nAnd the killer were treated us he says he when he came into the room\nWith a killer there he asked me who I was I said I'm Dr Cohen president of the hospital and I turned around and left and the FBI agent was guarding him said I don't know that I could have done that here's what Dr Jeffrey Cohen had to say [noise]\nProbably been invited ... couple of weeks ago\nMy inclination was I had to get back to normal life so I went to this is\nTalk to the nursing care of him before I went down to the game\nAnd he had already broke down and fears is for all those men\nI went to the game and came back\nBut I went to see the shooter and the cop someone's already got\nI wanted to try to understand why do you do this\nI have no answers I asked them\n... ... said\nThe on okay but I introduced myself ... journal [noise]\nAre left the FBI agent in charge of the news as\nFar as I'm not sure I Would have\nTime for leaders to leave\nAll the chaos is going on the gentleman didn't appear to be\nA member of him as a society\nIt was a civil noise\nHere's the noise\nThe doors were soldiers were being slaughtered\nThought it was hard to rise up and do something\nLike this is the word same things in the word for word Sarah leaving ...\nDoing things like this far into the fall\nIs okay I'm at that as a balanced inappropriate statement\nThere are too many harsh and ridiculous words some of them by the way many of them on the left we will get to that Dr Cohen a continued his comments he had this to say\nWe're one very simple mission threat Allegheny this will take care of sick people we don't air forces who they are willing to ask questions about ... says the cafe saucer patient sort of makes a very simple\nOur staff to do the right job so I Will tell you that I'm very\nOf them are they did a great job for bell\nSomebody who is yelling in the ambulance sort of hospital I Want to kill all the Jews taking care of by a Jewish nurse enters a Jewish hospital president\nAnd there was also the attending emergency room doctor who cared for the killer was also Jewish the nurse who cared for his father as a rabbi\nAnd um [noise] ... Cohen and says Dr Cohn and we just heard from\nHis personally connected to the shooting beyond his role of the hospital he live so close to a tree of life synagogue that on Saturday morning he heard the gunshots as the massacre unfolded he knew nine of the people who were killed nine of the eleven that didn't stop him from going in to check on\nHours look this is America\nAnd it really is and I I was reminded of something it's not nearly so dramatic because it doesn't involve killing and shooting in horror\nButton involves part of the beautiful part about the United states of America years ago I did a book called hospital which actually was one of the most successful books I've I've done it was a big bestseller\nAnd uh it was about some of the pressures that physicians encounter and some of the problems that physicians encounter dealing with those\nPressures that was a profile of dirty real life medical professionals and uh when I was doing the book I I went to Pittsburgh and I was doing a TV show and I was I'm told I was going to be on the show\nWith a um a a leading expert on substance abuse who treated a lot of doctors who had tons of substance abuse so I come to the TV studio\nAnd uh there is a husk Hasidic rabbi who was a sitting there and um I introduced myself\nAnd he says oh I'm I'm Dr ... and and he is uh Hasidic rabbi and he was also one of the world's leading experts on substance abuse and\nHe is in charge of psychiatry at St Francis hospital a Catholic hospital he graduated from Marquette University a Catholic university\nHe's always been joy she's from a prominent Pacific dynasty I was floored because I Know this rabbi ... from his work he's written one of the best Bible commentaries I've ever read period it's called live every day\nAnd [noise]\nI again there's something about that there's something about this story and it it actually move me to tears today the local Muslim association\nIn Pittsburgh has announced they've raised a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars to help the people a tree of life congregation at the service that they held in Pittsburgh on Sunday\nAfter the shooting the a\nMuslim leaders of the community were very prominently involved and give them some of the harshness between Jews and the state of Israel and and Muslims around the world this is a beautiful thing and it is a great tribute to the United states of America\nI think it's also a great tribute to the United states of America that um many people most people are going to welcome the president of the United states respectfully\nAnd with dignity and gratitude when he comes to Pittsburgh or in moments frankly we're going to be speaking to a Pittsburgh are named Lou whites\nWho was talked about some of the eternal evil aspects of what happened in his city or we'll be right back with that and with your calls on the ... that show\nHe was he was apparently saved from the initial response but he rushed in to [noise]\nLine of fire because as a physician he was trying to help people who were wounded or something\nToday that he ... district most well some of it he doesn't have any kids or what ever anyone in the community would die he would say cottage for them\nBecause he didn't have anyone to say cash for him but I Know that every Jew in the city of Pittsburgh an average around the world gets shipped back we'll be getting up and sank kind of courage for Jerry\nA memorial or and and honor the departed you let me let me pick up something and and the some of the little time we have left the\nOne of the things that struck me about your column you would reference the portion of the ... the Jews everywhere around the world in Pittsburgh and in Seattle and in Tel Aviv and income undo every Jewish congregation was reading the same story of Abraham bargaining with God to try to save the citizens of Saddam\nAnd a very great ran by the last generation whose name you know rabbi Moshe Feinstein asked a question\nAbout it and he asked the question why is ... why is Abraham are concerned about these evil people these citizens of Saddam why as the bargaining and there'll be half\nA divide to save the whole city for the sake of a few righteous people\nAnd the answer that he gives he says look when it says love your neighbor as yourself it's easy to love people share your values it's easy to people who agree with you what's hard is finding loving your hard for people who are completely opposite of you and that was what Abraham was doing a\nI read something and members rabbi fact I'm not sure but he said only by acknowledging the humanity of the other week knowledgeable in ourselves and you said it right I mean I think it all up man kind of it's very hard to love your neighbor special if Yunior my neighbor I'm just\nKidding [laughter] ah listen at it what what what you had to contribute to all of this is is so profoundly important and\nAnd again and I hope that the rest of the country can actually benefit from Pittsburgh to example and to be stronger I I didn't know that the Steelers actually showed up at the funerals\nUh today and ... and again that's that's a beautiful thing and ah maybe maybe in merit of the departed um ... we can\nWe can all do better and in terms of this spirit of community larger community for our country a voice vote posed Lou why says information and material at our website at

talking to some of the guys and\nThere was a very very good suggestion and seemed to me that was made and just by one of the guys on the radio newsroom and the other part of the country in the northwest\nWhich was ...\nI Hope and assume the president is traveling with his Jewish daughter and his uh his Jewish son in law both of them are religious and Jewish\nAnd because again with all of the attempts\nBy various people to make political hay out of this tragedy that the president is going to be honoring today by doing the right thing and going to Pittsburgh as ... conceded\nIf for the president had decided no I'm not going to go to Pittsburgh people in the rain them what you're not going to Pittsburgh you're not acknowledging they're paying are not doing you know he's doing the right thing\nAnd now let's hope that he does it no right way and it would certainly be appropriate if he got up and he introduced a\nMaybe his daughter and son in law but at least his daughter to to talk a little bit about how this tragedy does have specific impact on on Jewish people\nA one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number I'm LOU LOU wise had mentioned he

was on CNN\nOr what if you say to people who criticize you for opening your doors to the president of the ...\nWhen I first said that the president was welcome I'm I've received a lot of of email to numerous fits accounts I Can't keep track for every email I read through if you're reading that one so I just cannot keep up with it I've received many emails that\nAre not happy with those words I'm

I think that's said to me as those emails also ...\nAnd it just continues in this vicious cycle hey follow getting more have finally getting more and that's just not the solution we need to be better than this we can be better than is\nOkay he is completely correct\nAnd yeah it's it's not appropriate at this point is always appropriate to disagree that's our fundamental American right and disagree in criticized but the idea of hatred of up calling the other side of evil or a very prominent Democrats just called President Trump\nEvil evil um it is completely out of bounds\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Jose in Pittsburgh you're on the Michael ...\nMyth amendment I certainly can't yeah\nFirst of all it was just an honor to meet you at the battleground talkers toward

I'm thinking of your young man\nYeah okay go go ahead\nSo my comment with the uh shooting I mean\nWhat the media and the mayor of Pittsburgh and anyone else who wants to blame the tragedy on Trump they should just be quiet and let the president do the right thing and respect the dead I mean blaming murders for their crime and do not bring some politician you do not agree with into it\nI yeah and and again this is a time when even people who you may profoundly disagree with are are feeling some of the same things I mean this is one of the\nOne of the things about the nature of the shooting I have not heard anyone or not even David Duke or some of the prominent American Nazis or I even have a ... even ISIS I don't think has a commended\nRobert ... hours for what he did and I I mean I I don't know if you've heard the story earlier Jose about um\n[noise] uh that Dr Cohen who is the president of Allegheny General Hospital who came in and introduced himself to Mr ... hours after he got out of the emergency room it's a powerful statement ah really again\nWe're all Americans are above all we're human beings above all the um the the attempt to try to blame one side of the other\nIt's it's just wrong and and by the way to blame mass media for this is just wrong\nNow having said that do I think that uh there might be more attention paid by a media platform like gab dot com [noise]\nWhich are actually had done a lot of the posting naked Lee anti Semitic calling for death of Jews posting\nBy the killer here [noise]\nYeah that that kind of thing should probably be

fifty\nFour right I mean shortly after the Mayflower as thirty four years after the Mayflower okay that's an amazing thing\nAnd nonsense in of the political ads [noise]\nHas gotten quite crazy [noise]\nWhy is it okay\nFor a former presidential candidate very prominent presidential candidate former U.S governor [noise]\nEnd up by the way a physician and or somebody who should know a lot better Helen Howard Dean the former Democratic national chair\nWas just on MSNBC and Governor Dean had this to say about the way he perceives the current struggle politically as a fight between good and evil listen\nLook evil lurks in the hearts of men that\nIt does and what Trump has tapped into is he a\nAnd eventually will overcome that because we're the Republicans are always about the past\nAnd they're always about fear of the future and the Democrats are made plenty of mistakes but they are about the future and idealism and making America a better place I think in the end hope wins over evil but it takes a long time it works both of those working humankind\nAnd that's where the struggle about for a minute this has now become a struggle about good versus evil and the

would he just uh may have helped the governor of Florida when\nUh the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida when the race which I think it's a shame because I wanted very much to see Ron dissent is the Republican win that race but it's wrong for the president to call the mayor of Tallahassee stone cold\nThese um any ages did that I I think the\nMayor Gillum of Tallahassee is morally compromised ethically compromise I think he has a lot of problems\nBut this is the president of the United states you can't use that language Mr President but certainly certainly Howard Dean to say the president of the United states is evil\nDo you think it's appropriate for a former Democratic national chair to use those terms one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] this is one of the problems is we have just had a demonstration of evil\nAnd there have been three cases very\nProminent cases one not as prominent as the other two but it should be in which really evil was displayed vis a killing is a double\nKillings a homicide in Louisville and they have apprehended the perpetrator and in lieu of all there was a guy who tried on Sunday to get into a Baptist church a black Baptist church he was stopped the door was locked\nHe was armed he apparently had it in mind to kill some black people and then he found two people at random track them down or killed\nA a one one African American shoppers sixty nine in front of his grandchild put the gun at the back of the guys had assassinated him\nAnd then he called a black woman in the parking lot\nAnd this was a guy who was just mouthing off about the N word and ah and by the way it has a history\nOf violence in the history of psychotic behavior formerly married to an African American who you'd also abused by beating her and using the N word with her\n[noise] um this is a real problem this is a very real problem and it's a real problem when you have somebody who sends out bombs to Fifteen people none of whom are criminals\nNone of whom are evil but you see this is the problem it is evil to try to blow somebody up because you disagree with them politically\nIt is not evil to disagree with them politically sure you can express contempt or you can express dislike for George Soros or for Brock Obama or for Hillary Clinton\nThere lots and lots of people who dislike them but when you use the term evil it puts it in a different category and it's simply is wrong\nAnd what Howard Dean is doing here is wrong it's also deeply wrong with Don Lemon did a Don Lemon\nOn CNN had this to say about the biggest terrorist threat our country faces\nI keep trying to point out people not to demonize any one group or in any one ethnicity but we keep thinking that the biggest terror threat of something else some some some people who are marching towards the border like feminine so we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest her for in this\nCountry is white men most of them radicalized brought up to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so when we do about that\nIs he suggesting we should have a white guy ban what would you ban white guys from doing how about the white guys who work with the with CNN are they okay\nI I mean should there be no mixed dancing between white guys and other guys uh I I mean what what is going on\nThis is this is completely completely weird and crazy and unacceptable or let us\nGo to Deborah in Brooklyn New York Deborah you're on the Michael Mann that Joe\nHi Michael how are you today I'm very well\nAh I Love listening to your show I find your voice very soothing it's like therapy\nThat will do\nThat my wife was a professional therapist though but go ahead\nOr there you go I ah I was a Republican uh up until now Donald Trump came along and I'm now an independent [noise] ah I I I like when you do the things that you say you call it like it is I could just did that hands but then there's always a buck\nAnd I want to know why there's always a but he is what he is he says what he says that it seems like we say oh okay that's just Donald Trump them again\nSo why can't I say he's evil and we why we are far so what do what do you use do you think he's evil\nYes evil evil is a strong word and say you know the person I Would say the things he says how we say\nWell wait those ... there was a different things there are two different things to ever and this this goes to the heart of your challenge and I it's a great challenge I I think there are things that he says that are outrageous\nBut speech ... in in and of itself to coal speech evil\nIf if you are saying I order you to go out there and murder these people yes that's evil but to make some stupid remark and and Trump makes a stupid embarrassing remarks virtually every day I mean it's at and it's it's tedious after a while because when you talk about what he does\nWhat he is achieved as president you recognize as a former Republican Deborah don't you that he's had some successes as president\nYou know what yeah his his way his uh the way he like he doesn't articulate radically eloquent as nothing about and that is a leader on my mind that he's the president of the United states but it all it all\nAgainst everything he does that good because he he acts like such a total\nOkay what would you hold on hold on for a moment ... ... ... bronco Obama was extremely eloquent\nHe was almost always dignified um he spoke very well and I think he did a terrible job as president\nAs President Trump makes ... himself frequently grade he as he is not eloquent or he is often Arab rude and and childish and all those things and he was\nNot his record on appointing judges his record even on foreign policy is record certainly on Middle East policy\nAnd his record in managing the economy\nHas been admirable don't you think but it\nDoes okay so what do you care more about do you care more about what the president says or what the president does\nAs I got very very important looks like it's going I think it is important thing I think he lives in ...\nI think it is important but I Would prefer a ... and I'm a president who does the right thing [noise]\nAbove a president who says the\nBut it's a profound challenge and I appreciate it we will be right back\nAnd ... you know the normal American person whether they're white black they're under a lot of culture shock I call that a lot of stress in the nineties we add diversity visas and we saw corporate landscape change and when I was at Eighteen the illusion\nYou know the American was the minority a lot of times the American lost their job and they ship than somebody and and and this has nothing to do with the synagogue shooting but I'm just saying a lot of people are angry\nPeople have to understand that there's two angry group shares that just the minorities and the blacks I mean in women it's regular average person white what have you and it's been going on for for too long\nI look I agree with you I think there's too much anger in the United states so what are you saying should be done about it I don't think\nThe founding fathers said beware of the factions here very smart either the constitution and these politicians should not be practice and identity politics and and showing them and we're working with these groups everybody's supposed to be equal you don't get them positive rights because this is what starting all the problems\nOf the the point is you don't give people or you give people rights based upon\nTheir status as citizens of the United states not upon special status of a citizen of a certain ethnicity\nOr certain heritage and I think you're entirely correct It's one of the reasons that one of the most toxic ideas which by the way it seems that the Democrats have largely ... dropped is this notion of reparations\nAnd I'm Glad that's gone away appreciate your call let's go to I'm Joe in Los Angeles Joe you're on the Michael Mann that show\nThere Michael how are you I'm well oh go go ahead\nI I ...

to your calls to uh marry in Long Island New York you're on the Michael Mann that show\nAn evil evil gunman who of course now is in custody\nThe president's also accompanied by his daughter Ivanka and his son in law Jared Kushner uh both of whom live their lives as religious Jews\nAnd ... [noise] what is so sad and honestly it makes me kind of feel that virtually everything this president does including\nThings that are fine that are normal\nThat aren't necessarily brilliant are deep for profound but they're just normal president things ever everything is going to be controversial and I I I just anticipate this controversy coming across I have to give you a little bit of a visual description of what happened here\nIn front of the synagogue and the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh\nThey have set up a series of memorials\nTo as the fall and to to the eleven people were killed\nWho were murdered in that synagogue and people abroad flowers and\nAnd by the way President Trump a and I think probably through the influence of his daughter or maybe through his staff or a son in law who knows he knew that the Jewish tradition is that in in Judaism when you go to a\nTo honor someone at at a at a grave side um you you leave a a Little Rock a pebble I'm a sometimes it can be a larger stone but it's it's the idea that it's not something that phase is on the stage there\nAnd the idea that um there's a phrase in Yiddish that that means that the the dead\nDon't smell the flowers so ah basically that's a sign of morning and the president and the first lady and volunteer and Jarrett all brought they had a tray of of stones I Believe that secretary minutiae and\nWho was also a Jewish as secretary of treasury who is with them okay here's here's what I Am anticipating and honestly this is a case where I Hope I'm wrong\nOr the series of Jewish stars six point and stars stars David ... referred to as the ... the the shield of David and okay that those stars have been set up in honor of the fallen here\nBut they have been put in front of what is obviously crosses a that you would have on a\nTemporary grave side so what the president is seeing as he's seeing a Jewish star but behind that Jewish stars across\nSome idiot and it's not it's going to bring up a an element of controversy because what it shows is the president of the United states and the first lady very respectfully and some early\nOr leaving their rocks on the cross bars with across behind the star of David do I find it offensive that they used process to set up this temporary memorial this is not at the graveyard this is that the synagogue itself where the killings took place\nI think it's fine uh let let me also say I think it's it's a shame that er controversy has erupted over a campaign stop\nIn Michigan that I'm an advice vice president Pence was involved with an and here's the background of the story and I'll do it very quickly\nBecause we have some outrageous material to get to that that really does need attention but what happened was the vice president was he was campaigning for a a fine candidate named Lena Epstein\nWho was running in a a contested hotly contested congressional race to become a the first Jewish Republican woman in the house of representatives and that would be a good thing\nThey wanted because the vice president was making campaign of parents to have somebody say some kind of a memorial\nPrayer on behalf of the people who fell in Pittsburgh and that's also very appropriate\nWhat wasn't so appropriate is Lena Epstein for reasons that are completely unclear a lean I've seen as a member of a Jewish congregations she's fairly active\nShe is proudly unapologetically Jewish\nBut she apparently selected um [noise] to deliver this prayer a a a Christian um who actually went to a Baptist seminary and now styles himself rabbi and he was there wearing them\nPrayer shawl and he\nSaid this prayer in the name of a of Jesus and no it's not a good thing it it just isn't because of the people who died were not Christians they were not Jewish Christians\nThey were Jewish Jewish they were members of the conservative judge congregation and this is not a controversy that the vice president needs or the administration needs or anybody needs right now\nAnd uh does that mean that ... should not be elected to Congress do of course she should be elected to Congress but it means that if if we're going to be serious about trying to build\nA broader base of support for this administration there could have been much more care with that one now meanwhile the protestors who were trying to disrupt the president's visit to um\nTo Pittsburgh it's just awful\nAnd and uh uh demonstrators said Trump has fanned the flames of hating us partially responsible for this tragedy and his only making things worse by coming housing making things worse\nAnd what does he have to do with this tragedy the the person the killer Robert Bowers hated Trump because he felt Trump was to surrounded by Jews\nAnother protester named Suzanne has offered a said the president's a visit is not something\nThat people here want he has promoted more negativity than he has support and solidarity he's fostered an administration of white supremacy and he is not welcome here in our time of morning said one of the organizers\nI'm of the protest I look this is this is all crazy and wrong there was a um a comment on uh\nThe the buzzfeed from one of the protesters who is they're trying to say to the president not to get off the plane and Pittsburgh\nAnd the protesters said uh I'm here to honor the eleventh people that were lost to hatred and to send a message to Trump was fanned the flames of hating us partially responsible for this tragedy see if they repeated enough it becomes kind of a reality in people's\nMinds and and that is is wrong and it's despicable and then it leads to to craziness\nAn ... it it truly does I mean if someone wants to explain to me how Trump is responsible for this tragedy by a classic and I might\nAnd and somebody who was so anti Semitic city and totally rejected Trump\nIs outrageous and\nIt's outrageous enough that it can lead the kind of thing that you hear from Jim Carey who used to be a talented actor\nAnd used to be a very funny comedian\nAnd now he just won\nThe Charlie Chaplin award for excellence in comedy and a here's the way he accepted it in his acceptance speech listen\nWith modern times he criticized capitalism walking about drought accountants and that's what we have now we have capitalism without a conscience\nYou showed the common man being fed through gears of the brutal dehumanizing industrial age he took on the American right wing of his day it's worst evils hatred of immigrants contempt for the truth greed and the abuse of power\nWe are fighting those same evils today [noise]\n\nIn America and the United kingdom across the globe and we need to be clear shameless snus is not and will never be a superpower [noise]\nIt is the mark of a villain\nKidnapping children is not what great nations do\nOkay um [noise] there's much more and he even dedicate this award at ... has this I mean you're talking about a flavor of ice cream\nIs now being marketed as um a way to resist\nPresident Trump because he couldn't resist the ice cream you should resist President Trump's somehow by eating resist peak can [noise]\nFrom Ben and Jerry's\nAt how is any of this helpful to the Democratic party caused to the country at large to sanity\nIs illness and it shouldn't be indulgent should be condemned wait till you hear the way the Jim Carrey\nDedicate his award for excellence in comedy if said not too well known comedy stars will will get to that and more with your calls coming up\nThat the [noise] the way the way I'm allowed ... away from the front of the way that will be going on for how to log on\nClinton [noise] time\nOkay this is not the way he's condemned either the bomber or the synagogue killer but it's just completely\nUnfair and and by the way and Jake Tapper was attacked for this and he's responded\nI'm somebody I'm a road and that this is one of the most widely responsible uninformed downright offensive things to err on CNN and that's saying something\nJake Tapper showing his true colors by refusing to put a stop to this nonsense time to label the show not the lead with Jake Tapper but the mislead with fake tapper\nAnd then Jake responded to that by saying I immediately went to Mona Sharon and David Urban to rebut it and later in the show is we just played a Julia you off he apologized and took it back well she still apologizing she was on MSNBC\nWith Chris Matthews yesterday and a talking\nI don't know which side of the issue she's on now but again talking is the idea of nationalism listen\nLet me go to a ... Julia you know I saw it and that sort of a lot about history either World War two was the turning point that was the simulation of Catholics Jews\nThe doesn't we got through the door because of all the service our fathers and grandfathers fought in that war all of them you should see the destroyed David show Britain altogether some majority and all those tombs it's unbelievable\nAnd along with the crisis in I just thought that was the door opens and now I Wonder about certainly not universally in this country yeah\nAnd it's interesting you mentioned in World War two because when Donald Trump\nSaid that she was a national asked he didn't just off the cuff have international asked he said well I had an old fashioned world at work and I know I'm not supposed to head well the reason it's an old fashioned word and the reason you're not supposed to head as because national lettuce to two world wars and\nTens of millions of people dead and horrible horrible ways including and Holocaust so there's a reason for that stigma and ham kind of dredging that up\nAnd apply it to themselves as the president of the United states has you know as we used to say the leader of the free world and frankly horrifying\nOkay is it fair to compare American nationalism to nationalism for Hitler's Germany\nOr an imperial Japan [noise]\nThat an absurdity and utterly wrong or we will get to that and I'm more on the ... show plus a horrifying new poll that says most college students are afraid to challenge liberal professors we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWell that's our news on

has this\nAnd it's one of the reasons by the way I I haven't talked about President Trump talking about birthright citizenship\nBecause I think the idea that he needs birthright citizenship to get the basics cited the base for President Trump is already excited anybody who cares about birthright citizenship is an issue is already voting for Republicans I I'd I guarantee you nobody's saying oh well now President Trump is\nBringing up he's going to get rid of birthright citizenship which by the way seems to be guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment of the constitution in the United states and say dean sixty seven\n[noise] um [noise] anybody who's excited on that issue is already committed on the Republican side ... and by the way\nRepublicans are mobilized I think Republicans are going to vote and that's a good thing and I think Democrats are going to go out there and vote in great numbers the key to winning these very close elections across the country for the Senate for the U.S house for governorships is going to be reaching out to people whose minds ours entirely made up\nAnd um how does it go when when Jeff Sessions is in Boston and talking about religious liberty\nAnd this happens just just ask yourself if you're on the Democratic side does this help persuade people to go with your party in Europe cause\nJeff Sessions is speaking when a a Methodist minister interrupts him they sounded like this\nOne reason why the dog and they um\nWas hungry and you did not mean that was a stranger and they're not well I was not close me it was a stranger", "year": "2018", "show_name":
