I Know that you're finished it was finished the thing of the ... really interesting okay because what they basically want is they want a mathematical equation to explain where our universe comes from\nIf our universe can be shown to be a reasonably probable outcome of what they call the quantum wave a question or the quite ... corn way function\nThen they think they will have explained the universe but one of them are astute proponents of\nQuantum cosmology Alexander ... said well wait a minute\nMath were saying that math is basically producing the material universe but he says mass\nIs something that exists in a mind are we there for saying that the material universe there's actually a mind\nAnd that's not very congenial a conclusion because it's basically a materialistic way inspired cosmology the other thing that's really strange is that in order to solve the equation that gives you a universal wave function out which our universe might be a reasonably probable outcome\nThe the the a theoretical physicist has to impose were called boundary constraints on the degrees of mathematical freedom of this equation which is actually in hurting information into the math to get the outcome they want\nSo they're actually modeling the need an unexplained infusion of information to get to universal even if you get mad or out of math you you still can't get the information needed to produce the universe for the anyway you ... in the beginning was the word\nSo go on on the big bang yeah yeah so there's there's a number of these materialistic cosmology that are trying to circumvent\nThe clear an obvious implication of the big bang which is that the universe ... the material universe a physical universe had a definite beginning in time space matter and energy hocking in ten rows approve this with something called the singularity there I'm In the late sixties there's been an additional proof of this called the board goofy Lincoln serum\nAnd the citizens and cosmologists have been going crazy trying to stretch to try to find a way to circumvent this conclusion hawking himself worked on circumventing his own proof\nHe was the originator of this cosmological idea that crosses popularized\nBut it doesn't really work for the reasons I've specified and then there's another version of this\nWhere they want a it's called the inflationary cosmology were have one big bang after another big bang after another big bank it was mainly designed to circumvent the problem of the fine tuning of the universe\nBut what what would the odd a irony of that whole effort is that the mechanism by which you would get the multiple big bangs itself has to be ... exquisitely fine tuned to tend to die\nAnyway there's no evidence for and there's no evidence is your incite released the cosmological models asked that in the multi verse are far greater leaps of faith and we believe in God\nI gave a talk on this the other night here in Southern California and I remember the thing from Alice in wonderland says six impossible things before breakfast yeah\nWell the the the the these natural cosmology force you to posit multiple uh abstract explanatory entities influence on fields ... shut up energy strings multi dimensions of space to explain the the ... the one God would\nExplain got hooked on energy field so it was a show\nIn a Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studio [noise]\nNine Ninety intelligent\nConservative here for ... at the American federal rare coin and bullying for years I've been recommending precious metal dealers\nBut I wasn't sure where to turn when I wanted to make a change their mind your own\nPortfolio strategy so I reached out to my good friend Michael ... he's been personally working with Nick ... at American federal for\nYears and I couldn't be happier with Michael's recommendation or was able to speak and work directly with American federals owner that grove itch I'm delighted to say that Mick will never pressure you into buying high commission coins or gold but you don't need if you have an existing portfolio mikel personally evaluate their holdings before\nHe makes any recommendations on of mixed special thesis converting them performing coin portfolios into gold silver or plot ... whether you're buying or selling Michael of I recommend that you talk to Nick first eight hundred two to one Seventy six million before\nThat's eight hundred two to one Seventy six million before that's American federal dot com American federal\nDot com my name is ...

just about collapsed and with a perhaps\nThe Fort Lauren hopes of the Democrats to capture the U.S Senate meanwhile the house races very very much\nUp for grabs and are there is every attempt to try to use everything at hand right now this is like a bar fight and that's what happens in the last couple of weeks of the campaign that's what people talk about October surprises\nA because people will grab hold of anything of a bottle or its share or a ... anything that you can find an ashtray and you throw it in the ... and you see what hurts and you see what sticks\nThat's the stage of the campaign were in and what that means is that even when there is a gruesome assassination\nOf a a Saudi journalist and by the way he's not an American citizen he was living in the United states he had come to we're talking about ...\nI and I'm not even sure how you pronounce this in proper Arabic I'd always thought it was ... but a lot of people are saying ... touched show gee but whichever way he's was chopped up into a lot of different pieces and his body apparently he was brought back to Saudi Arabia\nIs not a nice thing is a terrible thing that had happened\nAnd if you listen to CNN\nWho's to blame well Trump of course why I'm Brian Steltzner was on with Fred hired on CNN and this is what Brian filter had to say\nTo lure someone to a consulate to December the body and to take it back to Saudi but it is a crime of a different caliber [noise] ah I Wonder if you look at what's happened the last five days and you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric not just from President Trump but also then from other world leaders\nHas anything to do with this anything at all\nOkay what what ah does Trump's rhetoric\nHas to do with the actions of Saudi Arabia I yes we are aligned with Saudi Arabia and yes we need to be there's a powerful piece by Walter Russell Mead the wall Street Journal today that make that case\nBut the attempt to blame the killing of this Muslim Brotherhood affiliated journalists to attempt to blame that killing on President Trump or on his rhetoric is is just absurd\nOf the people who listen to Trump's rhetoric and share it when he takes on fake news are not murderers and they are by and large not Saudi Arabian I mean while this was the response from Fred Hi it on CNN too uh that charge\nIn a case like this with important through on the actual crime a ticket focus on the actual criminal and you know of the Washington Post were very focused thing we've got to get the facts and then there has to be accountability and there has to be consequences [noise]\nI think there is a larger picture which was also fair to look at which is that a dictators around the world feel emboldened when you have proven reaching out to Britain to poison his enemies when you have China [noise]\nReaching out to Hong Kong and elsewhere to kidnap people they perceived to be their enemies and went in each case they supposedly enemies are peaceful ah you know if\nPeople have done absolutely nothing wrong or you have to ask why is this happening and I do think it's happening in part because the United states is retreating from its traditional role as a leader in the world and standing up for democratic values and including freedom of expression\nOkay that's fair enough I mean the idea that there should be no us retreat and you need to establish norms and rules of law by the way of course they forgot about North Korea is North Korean our good buddy you may remember\nThat I'm Kim Jong alone um it it also abroad had his half brother a murder\nBecause he might be dissenting from the regime look this is one of those things that there is obvious concern about and it's bipartisan and it should be a Lindsey Graham who's become one of the strongest supporters for the administration in the United States Senate had a\nHad this to say on Fox and friends about the cars show gay killing\nI Know there's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without NBS knowing it who's MBAs the thirty three year old crown prince who jumped him over other people he's the son of the best in king\nAnd I think he's on a on a bad track\nI can never do business in Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind us right and what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia is longer this guy in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them but I'm not going to have been the biggest offender on the floor the United States Senate this guy is a wrecking ball\nHe had just gotten murdered in a conflict and turkey and to expect me to ignore it I feel used and abused I was on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good allies there's a difference between the country and an individual thing NBS figure\nIs Timmy toxic he can never be a world leader on the world what does the president did thank us up to the president but what I Would do I know what I'm gonna do want to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYou know we deal with bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended\nThey had nothing but contempt for us would you put a guy like me and the president in this box for after all the press and has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his painted your country and painted him say\nOkay this is probably not the right approach frankly because you have a situation in the country where the crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nA is a in power because his father is old an ailing and uh I'm not sure that there is a power structure in place in Saudi Arabia that can simply replace him right now and there's a find peace in the wall Street Journal and I mentioned\nWalter Russell Mead the headline is don't ditch Riyadh and a fifth of righteousness and he makes the point now we have to deal with these people\nAnd I I don't think anybody would say that we shouldn't go forward with some kind of a deal with Kim Jong on which remains one of the most promising\nA diplomatic initiatives or the Trump Administration so far I nor should we simply write all Saudi Arabia\nOr there's breaking news the Washington Post is reporting that I'm the President Trump spoke directly to the crown prince to Mohammed bin Salman apparently he was ... together\nThe crown prince was meeting with secretary of state Mike Pompeo and they may have handed or the phone when he was on the phone with President Trump to a mom and then sell them and and according to the president the crown prince totally denied any knowledge of what happened on the council and turkey\nAnd he promises answers shortly on Jamal ... disappearance\nA secretary of state Pompeo press the Saudi leaders to move quickly with a transparent investigation of the disappearance of democracy Yogi and yes it sounds\nLike a truly awful business he he comes into the consulate because he wants to get papers he needs so that he can get married his fiance is waiting in the car outside now he never came out of that council it or at least they never came out in one piece\nThey brought in a an expert with the bone song they brought in an expert in autopsies they apparently packaged the various little pieces of his body and sent them back to Saudi Arabia this is a bad thing\nIs is it the fans even the norms of state misbehavior but then again Mohammed bin Salman has a um a a real problem also with a with the policy that's going on in\nYemen and the uh yes the Saudis are basically looking out for the American for American interests and standing up against the Iranians who are the ones who would really stand to gain if there was some kind of big break between the United states and Saudi Arabia which I emphatically hope there won't be\nBut something has to be done or with a show of arresting people who were behind this killing and making it clear that is not approved of or authorized by the government one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you remember may remember that\nUm [noise] last year the Saudis kidnapped the or whether they arrested the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri\nOf that was a disaster they also have this failed diplomatic confrontation with Carter which was a disaster\nWe need a stable productive and strong Saudi Arabia but we also need a stable productive as strong US government Alec Baldwin says we need to overthrow it [noise] how why we'll get to it coming up [noise]\nOK doesn't that sound a little bit like a conspiracy theory will it is now there's a history on this dinner [noise] this was originally\nCalled the Jefferson Jackson day dinner\nAnd named after the two founders as I used to be told of the Democratic party Thomas Jefferson\nWho started the Democratic Republican Party and then Andrew Jackson who started the modern Democratic Party\nProblem with those two guys they were both slave owners [laughter] and big time slave owners hundreds of flights so they changed the last year the name of the Jefferson Jackson day party to another illiterate of name\nIt became the Kennedy Clinton day dinner\nOkay that's a little bit of a problem and hash tag me to do you think that I Know Hillary says that President Clinton had\nNo abuse of power he was pure as the driven snow but you think that John Kennedy and Bill Clinton each have a a little bit of a problem and the view of feminist by the way feminist had a very very important anniversary they celebrated we will get to that\nUm so what are they change it to I mean what democratic region of our Lyndon Johnson they they have Lyndon Johnson on tape using the N. word\nA bronco Obama is still a little bit too recent and especially the called the bronco brown a day and you don't have Obama there try letting that he didn't come see you know what they did it the Eleanor Roosevelt there\nAre Eleanor Roosevelt never got elected anything she was very bright lady um she was a can you imagine\nBecause he can't do Kennedy Clinton you can't do the Jefferson Jackson the Eleanor Roosevelt day dinner maybe maybe they could make it the um Pocahontas dinner in the future\nOr they'll actually now the the entire\nNickname for Senator Elizabeth Warren um who is up there in New England the entire nickname should go back to what it originally was I mean the\nThe the nickname that she\nWas given was ... ... that's ... phony as an essay you lax and President Trump should apply that name to her very directly this is one thing that\nShe has accomplished something amazing here and she really has United the country [noise]\nUnited the country in ... against her why is that well you just have to listen to some of the responses and why it is that President Trump

one thousand and twenty\nFourth or as much as one out of sixty fourth a Native American\nNo really ... by the way let's take the best case analysis based upon the DNA tests and everyone should understand that that no one can except these DNA tests because very often they've shown that different companies do different tests and they come out with wildly different results that's even why\nElizabeth Warren had several different tests taken here\nAnd all of them show like most Americans the overwhelming majority of the European Americans and by the way also the over ... Wellman majority of African Americans there is a little bit of Native American and most people whose families have lived here in the United states for many years and that is true for Elizabeth Warren's family\nBut the best case analysis for her the idea that she has one sixty fourth Native American means that about a hundred and fifty years ago she had one of her sixty four\nGreat great great great grandparents who may have been Cherokee\nAs she says family lore suggested the entire thing ... was a ridiculous claim to begin with and\nWouldn't it be better for her she just backed off that no but she won't she basically insists that uh this is the way she's going to set up her presidential campaign my question to you\nWould be what does she thinking why is this a good idea\nIt makes her look ridiculous and make sure looked like a liberal racist why do I say that\nBecause for goodness sake if you grow up in a situation where you never affiliate with the tribe no one in your whole family within memory is ever affiliated with a tried you've never gone to the Indian events you haven't raised with any Indian culture you know nothing about Indian history or background\nYou have no connection no affiliation no participation know communal involvement with the native\nAmerican community and ah then when you get hired at Penn and Harvard you put down that your ethnicity is Native American because that qualifies he was a diversity hire\nI mean the whole thing is sad now is it the end of the world\nNo it's not the end of the world but she is making at the end of her campaign she is blowing herself up and she chose to do this that this would be a good idea\nOr does she really saying she should get the million dollars that President Trump by the way did not promise\nHere is what that is based on where a that's number three they're under Warren audio Jeremy where where President Trump makes the original offer to senator ... and he's doing a rally in

good on his post to write a million dollar check to charity of ms Warren proved she had Native American blood\nHe didn't say she had to prove she has a Native American a bloody said she had to show she was an Indian and that's right and if he doesn't do this he's ...\nWhat you call in and give her right [laughter] or an Indian better I'm as Lindsey Graham actually spoke on this he was willing to uh he's going forward with his own DNA tests and he's going to out Native American Elizabeth Warren here's what Senator Graham and to say\nIt was before and if she could be anywhere from one sixty fourth to one thousand Native American you have a challenge I'm going to take a DNA test all of you have I've been told him my grandmother was far Cherokee Indian it may all be just talk\nBut you got to find out a couple of weeks 'cause I'm going to take this they were going to take it I'm taking it and the result is going to be rebuilt here this is my ... this is how it didn't say what I mean

liberal reacted to this Elizabeth Warren ploy\nThe Cherokee Nation criticized warns announcement saying that are used to the DNA tested inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests with our continued claims of tribal heritage ... without a ... a lot of this revelation related when her at any point\nFor this and the reason it's controversial\nWhen she was at Harvard law school and when she was at the University of Pennsylvania\nShe represented herself as Native American\nSheep contributed to a Native American cookbook called\nPowwow chow Cherokee\nThe Cherokee Nation called the president's attacks interested but it's also criticizing Warren things she is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage adding a DNA test is useless current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person the ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nIn the video Warren says she respects the difference between family history and tribal affiliations\nNot enrolled in and try and only trying to determine tribal citizenship\nHuh [laughter] oh boy oh boy is right I mean really what was the lose more and thinking\nAnd what is her side of this is their side of this not that I see a there was a um\nCherokee Nation secretary of state and yes it is a separate nation officially ah was on CNN with Jake Tapper and Chuck ... junior had this to say\nThe problem with the DNA test as it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of uh Indian nation a member of an Indian nation\nDNA and best I can give you some indicators of some markers that are indicate that you're related to somebody who live long ago that may have lived in North and South America and they have been a native peoples of those continents\nUm it's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country that that's the base that's based on a legal definition certainly every tribe has that in common that we have some legal basis for citizenship that\nWe determine consistent with federal trainees\nFist holy unhelpful for any national later to cling to DNA to determine the artists tablets that their Native American in this country\nAnd by the way it doesn't really established require DNA there's a very famous American and he's a featured character in my book the American miracle name Sam Houston and Sam Houston was an

deserves applause and support and backing when he leads American the right direction\nAnd I think much of the time he does but\nThe idea that his personality should be the big issue that determines how we respond on this direction I'll tell you a way that I think Democrats are going to mess themselves over by trying to do that the American people don't want an impeachment crisis\nAnd and you have Democrats now were promised that if they take the house they're going to try to impeach President Trump's are going to trial and preach justice Kavanaugh\nReally that helps the country how it doesn't at all\nAnd it's absurd\nLet's go to Doug in Houston Doug Iran that Michael ...\nMichael McCaul you bet [noise] you know ah I think that should be some money I'm he made it\nMade a statement and the statements that had ... million dollars that proved that she was an Indian yeah she was one one thousand forty fourth opinions or should be about nine dollars and thirty eight that\nI'm sure you've done the math but the problem is he he basically said she needs to show she's an Indian and what that means is how do you define who is an Indian now\nIn the early Nuremberg Laws and Nazi Germany this was something go find out about the ... movie\nOr they used to count someone is Jewish who is eligible for execution and liquidation if you had one sixteenth\nA Jewish background now she doesn't close to that\nOne sixteenth Jewish background means what is it it means a great great grandparents she has to go back to great great great great that's for great great grandparents a hundred and fifty years\nAnd it's absurd she cannot prove that she's in Indian she cannot show that she's in India and therefore I think it would be wrong for President Trump to even pay the one thousands one one thousand and twenty fourth of it appreciate your calling and your sentiments Sean San Diego you're on the Michael ... show\nYeah you made um you've had a comment earlier and question whether it was racist or not or their racism involved is calling her Pocahontas\nWhen and I think it is racially insensitive rep and very nice to have one of her percentage or the fame to show for African

dollars all\nYou remember Rachel dollars on who pretended to be back black yeah\nOK it would probably not be received well in the Pocahontas thing hasn't been received well but if the cold or Rachel dollars all Harriet Tubman or if he called her by the name of some black hero 'cause Pocahontas was not a bad person she was a good person\nShe's somebody who's remembered fondly in American history for goodness sake if you look at that Disney movie oh she paints with all the colors and the when I I I Do not understand why when President Trump's whole point about Elizabeth Warren is that she's a phony\nThat it's insulting for him to use the name of a one of the most famous Native Americans in our history\nOr to make fun of her now do I think he should say that he's going to say it at all I should say folk ... which is how the thing yeah\nYeah I think that would probably be better and here's the way the President Trump responded yesterday to the ...

the ethics making news that Elizabeth Warren just might be as much Indiana's one sixty fourth with a great great great great grandfather who may have been Cherokee here's the president's reaction very went off\nWe are angry women are angry supposedly angry about\nChristine Blasey Ford and angry about hashtags me to an angry about powerful men and angry most of all about President Trump remember the resist\nA moment okay there are tons of angry women out there and right now in the media mind they are led by Hillary Rodham Clinton again that went well or end by Elizabeth Warren yeah that's going well and here's my basic question\nAside from the personalities of some of these angry women there's a new book and I haven't read it but it just amazes me that they publish a book and think this is going to really speak to this moment in our history is by someone named Rebecca Traister\nAnd it's called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nUh-huh\nOh what is the power of women's anger and what's the purpose of that women's anger let's say for justice for the sake of argument and I'm Serious I well we'll let you express this please\nLet's say that this record number of women who are running for office on the Democratic side there's also record numbers when running on the Republican side but leave that alone for a moment let's say all these angry democratic women\nWin and they come sweeping into Congress\nWhat's gonna happen next one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six how will it make America better how will that enrich our life as a nation or one of the points that Gerald ... make in his column today most Street Journal\nIs that is the it's more likely not ... at\nThere will be a divided outcome in this election and he says look it's possible that the Republicans will hold on in the house and they'll definitely hold on the Senate\nAnd yes that's possible it's also possible the sun likely it is possible that the Democrats will like the house that they could easily do and take this and that that's going to be much harder for them\nBut the most likely outcome is that the Republicans hold the Senate probably adding to our set majority and or the Democrats take the house narrowly\n[noise] so what does that look my\n... year old ... says is that looks like and even more divided America even more bitterness even more constant nonsense about the end of the world and if this happens then we can go on and this was the end of America as we know it more apocalyptic\nInsanity but the American people really want that\nIf you're voting for the angry women now they're ... let me just give you some flavor of this this is the way that this new book good and mad as written about\n[noise] uh this is the Meyer says uh\nHas its ... Myers says in USA Today as America grapples with the hash tag me too movement tidal wave Rebecca Traister his new book good and mad the revolution and power of women's anger\nServes as an amen sister

any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no no no well I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern today have said you should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think [noise] feel sort of resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now [laughter] now there are people who look at\nThe incidence of the nineties and they say a president of United States cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why\nAn adult but maybe that's\nWhere the investigation of the current incumbent against him numerous allegations have been made and which he dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and as I Believe came out in the right place [noise]\nIt it came out in the right place showing that the president was guilty of lying and obstructing justice\nBut people should really read Ken's stars book gives his book is called contempt and by the way it gives the light of what Hillary says she did nothing to demean the character of the president's accuses she did a great deal she did a great deal to demean the character of Ken Starr\nWho was a special counsel was a former federal judge who is an honorable and decent and patriotic individual\nDo you remember the term vast right wing conspiracy she kept saying up to the very very end up to the final DNA test and know that DNA test came out much more conclusively

talking about\nSonic a Lewinsky thing at adults at the age of twenty two when she was taken advantage of that new wave a severe elections so\nWhat ... what do you think of it they'll they'll come

cool maybe it was different in the nineties but today I think we're all understanding that there's a massive power imbalance between an intern and the president of the United states right I forget in trying to present with anyone as a power imbalance or your personal bomb attacks to me are you from are you all\nHave to flush\nToilet he'd be like I actually I don't know if you're watching the game I'll be like oh yeah I knew that I knew that [noise]\nAnd also of course Henry trying to deflect and make this about Trump like you're not in a position to be throwing stones at someone Henry especially when you actually sitting in laws' house\nOkay this is is truly a strange\nTo have the Democrats leading into the final weeks of the election with I'm angry women Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clinton Christian cinema\nReally those should be the standard bearers and by the way there's a governor's race down in Oregon where they're really\nCould be a big Republican surprised not just because ... and good candidate but because Kate Brown the incumbent governor has tons of our own problems or we will be right back with more on what angry women can and will achieve we'll be right back [noise]\nTo rape or assault or what have you and I would just like to point out that one of the most well known facts of male female sexual dynamics is that\nWomen tend to be attracted to powerful men [noise] uh and not so much the other direction by the way men don't necessarily [noise] aren't necessarily tried to to our for women so if you want to invalidate that [noise] you know those kinds of relationships there could be\nEven angrier more frustrated women than the one who wrote the book you mentioned\nWhat is it I think the problem\nIn the abuse of power the abuse of power was not only in terms of pursuing their relationship which has certainly Monica Lewinsky was very enthusiastic about there's no question about it\nBut uh was in concealing their relationship and a a hitting back at a great number of people and by the way using federal resources\nIt's it's so astonishing that right now people on the left I mean I Know on cable TV all morning they've been dealing with President Trump's angry reaction to Stormy Daniels that entire matter as embarrassing and tawdry as it may be\nInvolved the time before President Trump was in the White House long before and\nUh does that mean that it's utterly irrelevant no I mean there there are ongoing legal action some of which by the way has been dismissed that that Stormy Daniels defamation suit has been dismissed\nShe can't sue

there's there's two points I Want to make is one is a depression and there's always angry\nAnd so the response he gives an angry response to something and then the only way to respond is with that same kind of anger it makes sense right that's the way he communicates the second point\nI Want to make is that um\nWhen has a went have there been things against a man or against you know\nThere's things against women that happened and are responding to the issue that happens\nYeah but what what is the thing against women that happens is there's so much of this that is\nOn earth for years and
