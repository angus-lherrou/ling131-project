was not popular in our household dad couldn't stand him thought he was bragging mom couldn't stand him thought he was a record doors thought he was uncouth\nYou were the only one in the house I mean I I didn't have an opinion then is to have an opinion one way or the other which are the only one in the house or who embraced him and you said you're going to become the next heavyweight champion of the world and dad thought he had a big mouth and we'll get knocked out by Sonny Liston [noise]\nWe've had faith in the way I think it was actually with a heavy weight I represent fame and I tried to stay out of a way of motion of heavy part shares act I just wondering\nWhat you also thought he was fun and entertaining Kirk and the reason I mentioned that is because truly before a A R well how mentally died a very close friend of his told me that they were watching the news and ah this is during the the twenty Fifteen is a time around and they are twenty Fifteen I think it was twenty sixteen early\nAnd he asked um Mohammed Ali who he supported the president\nAnd you know who he said he said Trump\nAnd his before Trump became a real serious candidate and he said quote he's going to shake things up close quote\n[noise] Mount Everest writer\nSo Kirk I'm trying to figure out how is it the Kanye West isn't ... an Uncle Tom when\nMohammed Ali who's embraced loved by the black community or support supported Donald Trump and I'm either nobody knows that um Mohammed Ali supported him or because it's Mohammed Ali they gave him a pass I'm not quite sure which it is all I Know is if a con you went to the salon that must make Muhammad Ali one as well\n[laughter] one way to look at it [noise] just going to catch what you know black\nLeaders or whatever you want on our train right now you know get in trouble and proxy needs to kind of put his worst a little bit [noise]\nWhat what about the hammering he's getting Kirk a check out this guy this guy's name a bakari sellers he is a democratic strategist that's how they\nBuild him on a on a listening on CNN on CNN listen to this\nI'm not sure he and using them as a prop per se but what Kanye West is done with Donald Trump is what other people have done who gravitated in his in his orbit which is just shower him with adulation for what reason I have no idea um but ... my issue with Kanye West is is quite simple\nUm is that anti intellectualism simply isn't cool and Kanye West these issues as you say to these issues that they're going to talk about our our issues that are that are central issues and many African American communities are very important issues\nBut the fact is we're not sending Kanye West of the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have the depth\nTo um I Want to hear what Kanye West wants to do when we're talking about criminal justice reform or prisoner reentry the fact is he cannot he doesn't have that that just the other day\nHe was talking about a spin programs and how we needed to have more than program that had to turn around and ask a colleague what ... me and so what was what happens when ... what happens when they grow don't read\n'em and then we have this now Kanye West of what happens when the girls don't read ...\n[noise] I mean it is it's kinda tricked me 'cause she made her ... really good point she rambled him a little bit [noise] but he made several good points and there's nobody knows what to do about this won't trust if if I'm a welfare they can't we were done by now\nKurt Michael Eric Dyson is another pundit or here's what he said about Kanye West\nIs white supremacy by been true of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white races ideals are are\nFrom Kanye West mouth Kanye West is engaging in one of the most in the various practices yet a black body and brain are the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of it and see black sentiments I don't know how much more I can take or\nWhat I found that you notice they didn't talk about the guy sitting next to a cognac Jim Brown yeah mhm not one single word has been mentioned about him and he was sitting right next door\nAnd he also Jim Brown said that he does not want to ... denigrate the flag\nAnd where he playing in the NFL today he would not be taken a neat\nYeah not a word has been said about ... per\nWeek a hammer he could have it a little bit uh in in black media but not not the way Kanye West has\nBeen hammered no\nMichael Eric Dyson also said this wasn't of this\nI miss the old time gay understood that we're dealing with serious insidious forces that undermined is the ... who joined with genes easy to talk about you know a\nBlack excellence and the quest for black actually wants to know that was being role black I miss the ... who loves to pack will say just the other day I got Lynch bought some cricket chops and to this day them saying come soon to be\nGetting major pay will not get my check they taking tax so\nWe we pay and the cops the not the black so I missed that ... who brings high intelligence his friend Jaycee said back then back when the police were counted the black men there are ways in which hip hop can serve as a useful for him to articulate valuable ideas that people of color find residents\nIn the application to our situation right now this ... is a ... he was kind of a mess not Kanye West not cutting it as best and that's the real tragedy for my\nDear friend and great artist Kirk I thought Kanye West me and a little bit [laughter]\nI mean I'm going to talk about job for the black community and start talking about that we need to focus more on the communities that have not benefit it you know maybe get some jobs some industry or something in those areas and made perfect sense to me\nCorrect one of the things Kanye West said was that wearing the mega had made him feel powerful he felt like Superman he said because you grow up without a father and wearing the mega kept gives them a sense of power\nThat David Gergen a is a guy that worked in both Republican administrations in democratic ministry and he punted on CNN here's what he said about what Kanye West at about a wearing the ... to feel more masculine I agree with\nWhat your advantage by both said a listener ugly I and and I have no trouble with presidents are calling as celebrities are White House enjoying each other's company you know this has started way back where the water and hearty in Nineteen twenty calling in al ...\nAnd then we'll goes all the way after Richard Nixon calling in Elvis Presley a man with cameras by the way he very much wanted the cameras there or you know so that that just a\nPart of the presidential tradition but I think what you're putting your finger on is is that the judgment that goes into doing it\nIn the face of this horrific storms so much suffering in the country it would have been so much better to postpone Kanye West for ... for four or five days or have the conversations that person can't go to the people who are suffering some I\nHave a serious conversation and the White House for God's sakes about the relationship of storms\nThe climate change and when we're going to do something serious about that as opposed to having us for ...\nAnd and that is what is uh I I think so disturbing I don't know about Kanye West mental condition and I don't know I'm about what I what I did pick up on something I hadn't really thought about he kept saying about this hat and put in his head on and this had on may feel like a man and I kept wondering is that what's going on with\nSome other men in this country and their relationship with Trump is paying for Trump make them feel more masculine I just don't know the answer to that but boy the richer and over time I was in a in that session\nFor crying out loud Kirk I guess putting like make a cap is is cheaper or without side effects compared to buy agra I guess [laughter]\n... I'm shaking my lowest unemployment for blacks and measuring are just\nSo we're making headway so why would you stop that\nWe could go one little thing a Gergen said this goes back a long way Richard Nixon calling in Elvis ... Richard Nixon did not call in Elvis you know that story over showed up he just showed up and show that showed activists was hired\nTo one who showed up yeah I think he was feeling feeling his oats and a ... and it made him an honorary or a da ... something like that no he just showed up mix it in calling me and [laughter]\nThey made a movie about\nSure did alright current we come back when I talk to you about this journalist who went into a Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey and this journalist never came out cookout Larry older\nCalling now in place for the world with Larry Elder and his brother Kirk at eight eight eight nine seven one that's eight eight eight to nine seven one seven to for three [noise]\nAnd Kirk Democratic House member Sheryl Connelly of Virginia says that intercepts suggest that the Saudi crown pent ... crown prince might have ordered the this operation\nDemocracy Huggies this uh parents\nAt the consulate in Istanbul, Turkey is one of the most profoundly disturbing development and international diplomacy band our life and it needs to be\nInvestigated bully consequences neat that flow from the results of that investigation democracy so he is a legal resident of the United states the constituent her mind in northern Virginia and that there was none too with a number of people in the community mild mannered generous caring person\nThere have been linked details from the Turkish government sources\nThat suggested I hit team up Fifteen Saudis they flew into is simple went to that constantly murdered and then dismembered body mystical shoving\nKirk Rand Paul says if this is true we shouldn't be telling them weapons\nWere probably a couple of years that we've been supporting the Saudi efforts bombing in Yemen our ten thousand civilians have died but now that the Saudis appear to be involved with the killing of a journalist I think we shouldn't be selling them weapons we shouldn't be aiding and abetting what they're doing in Yemen and uh yeah signal\nNeeds to be sad I mean if we send signals to other countries that misbehave certainly we should send signals to an ally that this is unacceptable\nAnd I know what you're thinking what is Trump said\nOver and\nOver again I Will have to take a look at it exactly a UC released to journalists who you're talking to this is the price that we have to look into I'm not familiar with I ask you to guess how you can\nThen I wouldn't be certainly concerned that in fact we have lots of all and to his wife his wife wrote us say letter and address it to my wife and myself than we were in contact with her now and\nWe have just a thirty second what do we do about this\nI think we should wait and make sure they get sent ... basically I don't know who's telling the truth mhm 'cause it's kind of journalists bad you know brought on everybody's attention so where do you get your information\nMhm I'm Kirk do you think you would think the proper care if it was a journalist from the New York times I'm just joking [laughter]\nCurrent we come back we're going to play for a little broke the category is city city okay okay I don't leave town triple late nights living one S.

renegade\nSomebody who dares to talk about the welfare state of the connection between that and like a father somebody who dares to say that as he said yesterday the issue with guns it's not illegal is not legal guns it's illegal guns I have a right to keep and bear arms that was a short conversation wasn't it\nIn for Kanye West Adair suggests that he had an issue because he grew up without a father when the person who sat in that Oval Office for eight years wrote a book about it is difficult relationship with his father and how he earned had his own father and his house I'm Talking about

just yesterday this is Chris Matthews explaining why and his view a county where I was invited to the oval office\nPolitics that fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the ideas and he's a racist it runs against the either Trump like minorities that he's going after her Ronan going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects to your comes it will and politics\nAnd it's sort of a racial way and areas flip it it can be used in people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them that they think they're racist\nDid you hear that mostly he invited Kanye West in the oval office for white people because white people most of them won't vote for somebody if they think he's a racist says Chris Matthews if that's what you believe and why is that you are constantly saying things like this when he's\nAnd today America First there was not just the racial I mean they are but I should say racial the Hitler areas of backgrounds of course

educated\nThey're not keeping it real\nThat's what he said\nSo this is what happens to black people who are perceived as\nSellouts\n\nTo step back here for a second black people are more pro life or more anti abortion than whites\nBlacks are more pro traditional marriage than whites urban blacks have the most benefit for private school vouchers which Republicans want and polls show urban parents want but Democrats don't want to give it to you\nStudy after study after study shows that jacking up wages via a minimum wage destroys the job for the very people that the proponents claim they want to help\nEconomists George ... says I've told you many times has probably done more work on the impact of legal and illegal immigration than any other economists in the country no question that unskilled illegal immigration\nPoses competition for jobs and put downward pressure on those wages\nNo question about that my friend\nPeter personnel who's been on the civil rights condition for a number of years happened to be black\nTold us you might recall some weeks ago that the left wing members of the civil rights commission the conservatives and moderates all agreed that the data show that illegal immigration particularly unskilled or the immigration her jobs\nFor unskilled people living in the inner city black and brown\nSo for a black person\nTo consider a party that wants to do something to secure the borders\nTo minimize the unfair competition for jobs and downward pressure for wages somebody wants to give you your parent an option of getting you out of the underperforming inner city school we're only about fifty percent of the kids graduate and where those who do graduate cannot read riding a few to grade level\nRepublican Party wants to give you the option out\nIn for a black person to rethink his or her at least in the Democratic party you consider a party that wants to give me a better route to the middle class that makes me a Sambo coon us fill out an Uncle Tom self loading\n\nFly you'd have to do it I have a I Would say that basically says that welfare reason why a lot of people I Know they say you know first of all the ... is a limit to a lot of

years\nThat's when blacks began voting majority for the Democratic party while in bed with the Democrats that were raised his interpretation is in the south it was a bizarre compact the blacks entered into it and Tanya with is exactly right that's exactly what happened\nSo it was the father is the job and they say the more money for has more to you and your whole family we got rid of the mental health Institute in the eighties and nineties and the further away just shy and I guess what we were all shocked by\nWhat Kanye West effectively you're saying is can we knock it off this business about racism being the major issue in America is not back in Nineteen sixty four somebody predict that there'd be a black president within about forty years you know that somebody was Robert\nKennedy when he was attorney general said that he could imagine the possibility of a negro presidents the United states within Phelps forty years it was the toll realistic\nWell let me say first that I think are necessary to make it clear that well negroes or a president like qualified to me president the United states and many who will father five and fans of integrity and fans of\nVision in terms of leaders of the military but we do know of a sudden a problems and prejudices and ... it\nWas made it difficult enough However I'm very optimistic about the future or frankly I Am saying certain changes in the United states over the last two years does surprise me\nA same levels of compliance with the civil rights bill and changes that have been a most surprising so on the basis of this I think we may be able to get a new world president in less than four years I Would think of and this could come and twenty five years or less now\nWho was it a told us that racism is in our DNA is racism is in our DNA how can somebody predict in forty years time back in Nineteen sixty four that there would be a black president\n\nHolder when it comes to matters of\nGot us Ninety percent of the
