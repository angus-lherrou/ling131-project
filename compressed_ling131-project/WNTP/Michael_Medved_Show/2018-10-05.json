the one Republican dissenter Lisa Murkowski so pretty much a straight party line vote was one switch on each side\nUh fifty one forty nine vote it's one of the reasons that it's so important to get a better majority in the Senate\nOr today Brett Kavanaugh wrote\nThe Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle they do not caucus
