out there for everybody\nFor everybody yes we're going to be talking a little bit about this a new attack on President Trump will get a response on that the new attack which is really an old attack\nAbout\nPresident Trump dodging taxes and he isn't really a self made billionaire and there is it feels like about a two thousand page report seems to be very well research in the New York times so what is the relevance of this right now\nIt's obviously an attempt to tilt the election in the direction of Democrats will be speaking with Stephen Moore a advisor to President Trump and the Trump campaign about that and about the progress on trade\nWhere there's been great progress in the markets love it we've had this week the markets have just been on fire sky rocketing um why is that happening\nWe'll talk with us even more about that will also be speaking with Juan Williams on Fox News his new book about President Trump and the black community it's not a positive book toward President Trump\nBut the question for Juan Williams will be what about the evidence and there's lots of it that there is at least in increasing open mindedness to the Republican message from African Americans we will get to that as well on the ... show but first\nI just wanted to give you a little bit of perspective is as people probably recognize I was off for the first two days of this week because the conclusion of our Jewish holiday season\nAnd actually I Want to thank\nMark Davis for again doing such an outstanding job and are\nHelping to carry the ball on this show while we were completing what is a a basically it's almost a month long of one holiday after another and they're all important holidays and they're all meaningful\nThis one was particularly meaningful to me not just because our daughter was here from New York um and and not just because there was a great time to get together with family and and big extended family and began things but also because on this whole Kavanaugh matter\nI I was able to see a little bit of perspective and let me just tell you something that happened\nWhich I don't think I Will ever forget I mean normally I go to services I go to synagogue and a a and normally I talked to my friends I was approached by a little kid and when I say a little kid and ten eleven\nYears old and um\n[noise] it ... ... he asked that I'm not even sure we watch it you know I was with the courage to a hundred people there and\nAnyway so the kid comes up to me and he says I I heard somebody say here that that Brett Kavanaugh through ice and somebody a Thirty Years' ago\nWhite lines that a big deal and I had not yet\nSeen the story about the alleged a bar fight it one thirty in the morning when Brett Kavanaugh was a sophomore I Believe at Yale and then I later in the horrors of ice throwing\nAnd somehow it this is now reaching ... kids in America I mean under age kids this is where our politics is\nA is that just think about think about it think about it I mean not that it's okay to throw Weiss or not\nThat it's okay to be under age in a bar find them cetera et cetera no one uh was damaged or charged or arrested in this a bar or they were arrested they weren't charge\n'em okay this\nWhole idea where our politics is right now I really do believe those political consultants and ... and campaign people who are saying that right now the Kavanaugh thing as powerfully helping Republicans and I believe for one very simple reason\nIf you like\nEverything we've gone through with cabin on four in the back in the forest and the punching in the pushing the nastiness\nAnd then you're going to vote for Democrats because I'm a Kavanaugh was not arrested okay let let me make that clear there was a police report about breaking up a bar fight and there was an allegation that he threw whites\nAnd a ... again I think it's more relevant to the Democrats want to throw ice out they want to throw out ice they want to get rid of the immigration and Customs Enforcement I mean it was anything is more relevant\nThan the idea that Brett Kavanaugh when he was at Yale I'm I\nWas a member of a hard drinking fraternity ... the whole idea that this is significant and this is worthy of our attention this is where our politics is right now if you want more of the politics of personal destruction if you want more\nOf let's go over every single detail\nOf people's passed to try to smear them and destroy them if you want more of this feeling of constant combat then sure you want the Democrats to take over the house because that's what you'll get you'll get impeachment you'll get in fact a Gerald nab blur\nThe radicals from Manhattan and he is he's one of the most left wing members of Congress\nWould become the new chairman of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already talked about impeaching justice Kavanaugh after he is confirmed\nIf you think that's where politics should go then first of all tell me why secondly if\nYou are a little sure to vote Democrat anyway if you do want to change your view on politics that is a little bit more civil a little bit more respectful a little bit more\nAbout results rather than just destroying the enemy and results for the American people more days where the stock market is is a more days where people are working where people get\nRaises I mean across the board it's happening now\nAnd ah\nAnd meanwhile what what's the focus of the focus is on on President Trump not mocking\nBut daring to question a Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd he did it at a rally last night and President Trump is on button and rallies and do this wasn't a speech but first of all people say well he ... he didn't imitate her he referred accurately to some of her testimony here was the president of the United states and what he had to say\nI Want to write I Wonder\nDo you think it was you know I always wonder how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years you don't want I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know how to [noise] well I don't\nI Wonder if that's the only ... [noise]\nI don't lose fat or a man who lives just shattered\nOkay um [noise] look at ... is it somehow out of bounds probably it would be better if the president do it didn't do it\nBut is it appropriate to question her testimony or you can only question\nJudge Kavanaugh\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number the I'm Sarah Sanders was asked about that today by John Roberts on Fox this is the White House press briefing about President Trump's comments about Christine Blasey Ford and here is the presidential press secretary Sarah Sanders\nWhy does the president said was he ... he says he says the\nPresident was dating the facts I frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel missiles were poor he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nOn whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody\nSays anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous this entire process has been in disgrace and the only reason that it's been that way is because Senate Democrats\nDidn't do this the way that it should have been done and they circumvented the entire system and frankly they've undermining our entire judicial branch by the way that they've acted in inappropriate missiles which they've conducted themselves\nOkay I I Believe it is with that in mind that ah\nCertainly the Republican base\nPeople who voted and put President Trump in the White House met bases getting engaged and that's a good thing there's other reasons for having to do with the economy will speak with us Stephen Moore a coming up about the future of the economy and its political impact\nBasically the theme is President Trump didn't make the money on his own he got all the money from daddy and secondly I'm both Trump's both father and son cheated on their taxes why first of all why do you think they decided to spring this right now\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... march thirteenth ... that was a it was it ... I read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing\nI had a couple impressions I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up out of the first point I made was wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and seeing you know with a hundred\nTimes you know friends episode re rod you know that you've already seen twenty times how many times of the New York times run the story I I really I worked on the campaign they must won three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they went one last year and now they're running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one they've run multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because I've been to this movie before the second point I made us look they're alleging tax fraud tax there was a difference a\nMichael between tax avoidance\nWhich any good businessman them any good you know head of household will do you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I Try to pay the least amount of ... after you got the most I'm Out there was a shock backs avoidance and tax\nEvasion and they are they are accusing Trump of tax fraud went a lot of these look I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things were just legal ways of of minimizing or tax burden and is there any American in the last ... years has been funded by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason they're campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again you're all one hundred percent correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN uh Chris Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump a release his tax reforms\nI advised Trump among many other people during the campaign do not do not really sure ... because if you think this report which were thirteenth they they did Thirteen thousand words they\nDon't even have you know a lot of the tax documents there's a man who has you know warehouses full of ... tax document through all the businesses he's running through the ... and all this I mean I I just think it would be a Pandora's\nBox okay uh and and don't file your taxes in a Pandora's box that Stephen Moore\nWho is a distinguished visiting fellow in the project for economic growth at the Heritage Foundation [noise] so what does this mean politically with a campaign coming up an intense fine we'll get to that and more on them eventually [noise]\nNine Ninety intelligent conservative talk\n[noise] with\nIs er news ... news in Washington\nRepublicans ... results of a new FBI back rather best vacation into springboard W Brett Kavanaugh as soon as this afternoon Republican Senator John Cornyn ...\nWe'll see attuned perhaps as early as they sort of Bob Corker costing the timing was a certain he's delivering the final FBI report could be pushed to tomorrow once the FBI piles or deliver\nA senators are expected to view them in a secure facility even store them you know ... to make sure they stay after you in court order the the U.

in Nineteen sixty four changed America and changed life or your family how\nWell first of all the book is structured in terms of the civil rights act or fix before so that you know we go through

Law doesn't accept by people well that was true to the sixties but she does the day and of course I could say hey bad you know look at me here I Am having lunch at the White House and he's ... who's the other black guy and I said\nOh that's the president Ronald bomb if you don't live in a different world you live in a different universe Advil for his men this progress made in this country\nPresident Trump has invited to the White House no okay would you go if he did no\nSee I don't get that as just an end to the same thing with with some of the\nUm in other words like you I I Want President Trump I Want Republicans generally to uh be a more broad based party not just to be the party of older white guys are going to be a party that reaches out to everybody because otherwise we have no future\nAnd uh so why why is the president invited you would you not go to the White House\nWhere I think he's insulting condescending and and\nSo lacking in any sensitivity or knowledge of how American history you know central to American history has the story of black history\nSo when he says things like calling a black woman Omarosa a dog or calling another black woman a congresswoman Maxine Waters who is a tremendous Trump critic but he says extraordinarily low IQ\nWhen he gauges and politically or you know advantageous tactics I guess with his base like saying the first black president wasn't born in this country and then he uses that\nTo elevate his profile I think this man is just about the fighting the country about beating people racial hate and I'm not going to be in his company\n[noise] okay [noise] ... when you say that what was your ear nose and he's going to be ... you don't expect that he is going to be removed from office do you\nI don't know I mean I don't know what Mueller has in terms of the Mueller probe if that's what you're talking about\nYou know I'm just talking generally he's going to be president for another two plus years two years three months\nAnd um [noise] okay during that time period\nAnd and this is a part of the the challenge for your book and let me back up for a moment because a lot of people may not know but one you wrote a courageous book they got you lots and lots of attacks on the left it was a book called enough the subtitle is the phony leaders\nDead end movements and culture of failure that are undermining black America\nAnd what we can do about correct and one of the things you talked about was\nHaving um black leadership to talk more about achievement and a little less of a constant sense of grievance aren't aren't aren't you coming into that trap that that you yourself described in your book enough\nNo in fact I Wish that the president President Trump would celebrate the idea of black achievement in this society\nInstead of you know always talking about black people in the way he says oh you know they live in circumstances worse than Afghanistan their neighborhood spill with violence and poverty and joblessness and bad schools I'm thinking wait a second that your description of black American twenty Eighteen\nI mean right now Michael forty percent of black Americans are in between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars an additional twelve percent between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars so you can see a majority of black America is either in the middle class or beyond\nThis is one of the prime achievements of the civil rights era in addition nights they obviously the growth of black political voice in power as part of American society\nSo these are tremendous achievement so I'm all about looking at how people who were\nFaced with such disadvantage in this society slavery legal segregation ongoing racial bias and all the rest nonetheless\nHave thought out the American dream and have kept it alive and and want to succeed ... you know like the Jefferson slogan they want to move on up\nRight absolutely good stuff but this president instead he focuses on the twenty percent\nWho who are in poverty disproportionately young people and kids often times because of broken families on the like and he makes set out to be the entirety of the black part like they're all going to mug you are going to take your job or are they going to ruin your schools I think it is just so deceitful and dangerous because again it is racially device that\nOkay I again I I ... some of the same uh comments by President Trump and gestures by President Trump I've been\nHighly critical of on this radio show a because I'm not one of those people who believe that President Trump can do nothing right or nothing I'm ... but I also I'm a believer not one of those people things President Trump can do nothing wrong and I'm not one of those people things you can do nothing right\nAnd he must be doing something right because we covered on the air before\nThey're a bunch of polls and it's not just ... and there are six major polls that show that his approval rating in the black community has been going up\nAnd largely that's because we do have a black unemployment rate that is the lowest ever measured that people have been making the kind of continuing the kind of economic progress that you're talking about right\nFirst of all the polls that you're talking about is a poll that by its own admission has too few black people polled so what you get a distortion the reality is with and I find that this is so troubling about\nA two thirds of Americans think race relations or worse today under President Trump than they've been in the past you also get higher levels are getting more than fifty percent disapproving of how Trump handles race relations\nAnd the most difficult one for me to accept and I think this may surprise you Michael is it forty nine percent of Americans said Trump is a racist and the reason that bothers me is I think it just shuts down a power station if you say something so flat leaving people think oh I'm a Trump supporter or I'm not but\nI don't want that I really want people to think\nAbout how this country is becoming more diverse you're getting greater sense of global economic and cultural mixing and how do we deal with that when you have a president who's so I think the vice if on racial issues immigration\nOkay so let's let's approach that approach how other leaders can change and how the president can change to deal with this more effectively I have what the hell do you have to lose [noise] that's the title of the new book by Juan Williams' movie right back [noise]\nWhere I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee\nAnd the comments case that we need a hill and you know it was very slow to come out but then the committee the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they dismissed that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leaked and then he came out so it's very similar because look at professor Ford\nShe sent a letter to a congressman ... and it makes its way to Dianne Feinstein\nAre and then her name is weak or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... ... doesn't think similar to me is the level that charge I don't think that anybody that\nAh you know Clarence Thomas ... on a better\nYeah but my uh one there's a difference in touch and the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do when he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission it was a government official and he was already yellow graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh has to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYeah but I think that the larger issue here is ... er of character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because they you know the whole presentation of himself as a virgin a choir boy he used to go to a book is the was and then all of his friends like this guy was a big grin and he loved the party's own\nAllen okay wait a minute if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe someday I'm not really might have been for health particularly in Washington DC becomes a fifty first day which probably won't happen but in any event or one um would you vote for ... confirmation no not at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because the way he presented himself as the hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off even\nMaking all sorts of suggestions or got Clinton conspiracy theory again and the Democrats or I was thinking wait a minute here's what you're trying to be a judge on the Supreme Court you're displaying a tremendous lack with ... and permanent or\nDon't or they were given given the amount of money that was spent by George Soros and other than it's well known as it's now come out that the\nThose two women who corner Jeff Flake in the elevator or actually operatives of this open society project which is a Soros project or sometimes they can can you well I unfortunately I think we are\nOut of time of the book doesn't have anything to do was Brett Kavanaugh but of course\nAt the moment that is an issue that seems\nTo touch almost everything the book is called what the hell do you have to lose its claws subtitle is Trump's more on civil rights Juan Williams of Fox News always

Rachel Mitchell emphasizes and her ... she was the prosecutor who ask the questions of her and actually set them up pretty effectively when you read this memo\nIn any of that here was a Sarah Sanders endemic pasta or about that to President Trump's comments\nSince there's something wrong with the president of the United states mugging somebody who's a shoes sexually assault seemed\nTo me that he was stating facts that Dr ... herself a laid out in her testimony once again I every single word that judge Kavanaugh has said has been looked at exam and picked apart by most of you in this room but not a new one is looking at\nAh whether or not the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them\nReligiously drugs problems as they're doing all this\nI think both Dr Ford in judge Kavanaugh ah or victims at the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely\nDisgraceful what they've done and exploited this process they exploited Dr Ford they're winning all of the women that have come out to make any type of accusation this isn't the process that should've been done is certainly everybody deserves to be hurt but that includes judge Kavanaugh and that should be part of this process and the facts have\nTo be looked at and I think you have to look at the prosecutors memo\nThose are where are you see all those facts laid out and I think she makes a very

I can't believe that this is where we are that we are making the choice about who we want to be in the country we are making choices and the people that we're putting in positions of power whether it be Trump\nOr cabinet or our institutions I sexual abuse had been institutionalized in this country\nAnd it ends heartbreaking for me and I just don't think we can allow another generation of women and children to feel as though their government is not listening that doesn't care that they are invisible filled with a range for for fair and just go on and say you know he was just stating a fact slow up I mean this guy in the blue I can state that fact\nBut if I Do it totally a little off like\nThe sky is blue how I'm knocking someone that may have said that so so how old is everything right now

hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six and remarkably enough or at the FBI seems to be close to come ceding its investigation a a an update over at the hill\nSays the FBI is said to be wrapping up its investigation of the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh so what are they found\nWell we don't exactly know\nNor as the Republicans repeated again and again when they were resisting the idea of this extra FBI investigation will they come up and say well we found that he's guilty as sin or we found that he is as white as the driven snow or or I shouldn't say white was innocent as the driven snow\nOr because I think it's very very tough when\nVirtually all of the principles in this debate are white uh it's it's very tough to find some means of making this a racial issue but of course Democrats have been trying and trying and trying\nIt them see them as a former FBI special agent he's a wasn't special agent in charge of Los Angeles which is one of the most important bureau ah offices and the country\nHe said it wasn't unusual that the FBI was not going to be viewing Ford they were not going to be interviewing Christine Blasey Ford they're not going to be interviewing a judge Kavanaugh again I mean after all each of them spent hours\nIn front of the Senate Judiciary committee plus they have both been extensively interviewed by the staff of the Judiciary Committee apparently the um and and this by the way I think is a syndicated that judge Kavanaugh\nSpent more hours over thirty total speaking to the staff of the Judiciary Committee than any other nominee for the Supreme Court or for all of the others combined and with more questions asked\nI think it's safe to say that he is the the first nominee where where his drinking\nIn a high school and college has become a serious issue by the way that was not the subject of the the FBI background investigation apparently they are speaking to Deborah Ramirez who had made those comments about his freshman year at Yale in the basement of Lawrence hall and ensure\nLet let me speak personally for just a moment because as people know listen to the show I went to Yale once upon a time\nAnd uh I did my first year at Yale Law school and so this was before a judge Kavanaugh or was anywhere close to the campus in New haven\nBut I ... at places like that are very tradition bound the culture doesn't change that dramatically\nAnd is it the idea that drinking\nIs a very big deal for a lot of people in college I think that's true I mean breaking news and once they're they're old Yale songs including the ... song which is very well known it became a smash hit are all about drinking\nThere are there there are lots of ah lots of references and this goes back to songs dating to the nineteenth century\nAnd I I Will say that does that mean that everybody gets drunk all the time\nNo I I I was thinking about it and I\nI didn't drink and college sorry um I Wish I could say I didn't look I turned out okay and where at least I think I did um [noise] but no I um I I did not imbibe I didn't like the taste of beer at that time and a\nAnd most of the people that I knew [noise] sort of and I write about this and right turns when I talk a little bit about my ears it yeah\nAnd part of what happened is\nIn the late sixties\nThere was a transition and people who have been very obsessed with beer became very obsessed with pot which I thought was more obnoxious I mean really more obnoxious because people made us so squeezed\nThey just thing of it with their flashing strobe\nLight and oh man oh wow this is so amazing\nAnd I don't really think that anybody know not Brett Kavanaugh are not members of de Cady not not anybody or have the idea that drinking beer was a path to who I meant\nAh I Know I don't think that was the case so maybe at the University of North Carolina they've just published and this is part of the very needed role of a free press there's a website That's published some photos including photos of Christine Blasey Ford\nDuring her years at Chapel Hill and University of North Carolina\nAnd showing her as something of a party girl of there is a statement\nThis covered now in the New York times today the New York times not just Fox News it's the New York times is covering the allegations by her former live in boyfriend who says that\nAll of this stuff about how she was traumatized they were dating for six years they knew each other casualty averse to they were dating for six years between Nineteen Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he says a number of unpleasant things abound a Dr Blass the Ford now is that off limits well he's do ... rightfully\nQuestioning her credibility for instance on the stuff that she was afraid of flying and that's why she couldn't make it to the hearings to testify earlier when it was very obvious to everybody that well this is nonsense they they asked her\nRachel Miller asked her about her flying and she said oh no I'm not really afraid of flying so why did you tell that to the committee and doesn't this go to the issue of credibility\nAll all of this stuff it seems to me that if you are going to come forward\nAbout something that happened too long ago from what you feel you have never ever ever recovered\nWell do you have to expect that there will be some pushback and um [noise] the the way the New York times highlights their story a Christine Blasey Ford's credibility under new attack by Senate Republicans\nBut uh in who's the following the former boyfriend told the Judiciary Committee that she witnessed personally Dr Blass Z helping a friend prepare for a possible polygraph examination contradicting her testimony under oath\nDr Blass he a psychology professor from California who also goes by are married name Ford was asked during the hearing whether she'd ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test she answered never\nBut the former boyfriend whose name was redacted from a copy of the sworn statement provided\nTo the Judiciary Committee said that when they were\nTogether in the late Nineteen nineties he saw Dr Blass a use her understanding of psychology to assist her roommate\nOf the time Monica element clean before interviews for possible position positions with the FBI or the U.S attorney's office that might require her to take a lie detector test\nQuote I witnessed Dr Ford helped make lean prepare for a potential polygraph exam demands and the statement Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect\nHow polygraphs works and help me clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nMeanwhile ms ... who is a former FBI agent denied the assertion today she says I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I've taken it anytime okay\nSo here's a disagreement\nDo we know who to believe here know do we know who to believe between a doctor Ford and judge Kavanaugh will we are going to find out a little bit more about the other witnesses\nAnd yes she identified it was Dr Ford who came up with the names bee Jay's mice\nAnd um [noise] a Kaiser ... her good friend who says she's never met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so she couldn't have been at that party Brett Kavanaugh was in fact that that party\nAnd then march judge and what is the FBI likely to say and how was the vote likely to go and who will decide this final vote will get to that with your calls coming up on the ... one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nHe was angry he was ranting he was ... I was astonished as his as his Iran's I mean he's a judge who's a sitting circuit court judge you supposed to be nonpartisan that part is enraged that's the most on judicial thing you can do anything as soon as he were unfairly accused\nHe's still supposed to behave as a judge his edited ... should be disqualifying the show no judicial temperament\nBut we know one thing he does not had the temperament to be a judge\nOr the Supreme Court I've never argued in front of the Supreme Court but I've written amicus brief and I I've sat in the Supreme Court\nHow can he can credibly on the court and claimed to be impartial with temperamental\nLike\nPainting belligerent chain in full of partisan venom keenly yelling he was pounding his hand on the table I was like going up in the United States Supreme court justice he showed a lack of judicial temperament that I wouldn't want my case to be heard by them\nI don't think anyone in America for Republican or Democrat\nWe'd want someone as biased and his uncontrolled in his range\nI couldn't even as range temperament is just so I think he's going to be resentful\nI think that out of everything we can talk about the FBI investigation but even if they ... it clear some I think that he killed himself into a hole that he can't come out of and be a responsible terrorists on the Supreme Court without being angry Henry Hey\nBy the way let let me mention the name here the name as Justice Clarence Thomas Justice Clarence\nThomas was also angry when he testified before the Senate Judiciary committee back in Nineteen Ninety One remember he accused them of a high tech\nLynching and he was angry and he was right to be angry and I think Brett Kavanaugh's right to be angry there's what Orrin Hatch wrote today it's a terrific piece\nHe says we're starting to see arguments like the following even if judge Kavanaugh's innocent what he said of the hearing and how he said it is just qualifying this is rich says Senator Hatch\nTheory and current and the first place only because of democratic do publicity that occur only because Senate Democrats sat on ms Ford's allegations for six weeks rather than referring them to the committee investigators as they should have done immediately\nIt occurred only because ms Ford's lawyer's recommended demands for by Senate Democrats refused to tell their own client of our invitation to testify privately in California as she said she preferred the judge cat\nKavanaugh had the temerity to defend themselves vigorously is now being counted as a strike against him\nI think for many Americans is to his credit we will be right back [noise]\nTo store used ...\n[noise] well that's\nOur news on the feeders in Washington Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is declining Democrats requests for a briefing by FBI agents on the investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh McConnell set in a letter Wednesday to Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer but he believes Democrats would only use such a briefing to the lake Kavanaugh's confirmation\nThat GOP leader also said a briefing by FBI agents would be unprecedented and a regular and not in keeping with previous practice the FBI is expected assumed provides senators what the results of its investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by Kevin ...\nWhen he was in high school and college Kavanaugh has
