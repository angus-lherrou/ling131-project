new community\nOn though so you first of all you're one of the to Google Plus users who were really upset but\nSingle parents community with charcoal digit membership at ... and you need a good are over forty thousand\nWell the reason why I the reason why I say that is Google said that they shut it down not only because they had we been talking about this and the next hour but they had it open for three years but basically the heads of bills that nobody's using it anyway so it was shut it down so you do have different options there is one side\nOr that you didn't mention is that is called
