much much more of this with impeachment investigations and lots of investigations and lots of hysteria and the end of the republic as we know and\nUh and basically some of the Democrats on the Senate

think he's talking about a a heaving analogize is the ah the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nWith people getting their heads bashed in we're has there been some cruelty or some salt on the

to override his veto and ... quote Medicare for all spending the United states government literally into oblivion\nAnd it's come on ... this is craziness right now and this is talk about a\nCivil war there were issues in that civil what is the issue here\nWhat is it that that Charles Blow thinks is the key issue in his column that he writes liberals this is war and by the way the next day or actually it was the prior day the liberals this war that this morning\nOn Saturday the time that a big article ... courts legitimacy crisis is by Michael ...\nAnd he makes an interesting point which is that for justice Gorsuch injustice Kavanaugh they're the only two justices in the entire history of the Supreme\nCourt who have been nominated by a president who didn't win the popular vote and confirmed by a majority of Saturn senators\nWho when you take all the votes of the people who voted for Gore such an all the votes of the people who voted for\nJustice Kavanaugh and you put them against\nAll of those gathered by the people who voted against them well there were more votes for the people who voted against\nCheap but this is craziness because that's not how the way we choose US Senators it's true that Wyoming gets two U.S senators there too fine conservative Republicans so to California\nAnd Wyoming as a population of about six hundred thousand and California has a population of thirty eight million they have the same representation in the U.S Senate that's how you find more votes on the other side\nBut this deliberately is the way they set up the constitution to protect smaller states so that\nYou don't have a situation where everything in the whole country is irrelevant except for California and Texas and Florida\nAnd New York everything else doesn't count I I mean this is very obvious and yes people\nWho vote in California and get to be counted in the popular vote and they certainly have a big say in the electoral votes\nBecause you've got fifty five electoral votes in but here's here's the basic point his complained is not against the legitimacy of the court\nHis complaint is against the constitutional system that has worked pretty well\nFor two hundred and forty years\nReally what's wrong with these people you're going to challenge the legitimacy of the court not based upon the qualifications of justice Gorsuch or justice Kavanaugh\nBut based on the fact that the senators who voted for the most of whom are Republicans represented states with smaller population than the people who voted against them one eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six ... really it's foolishness a deep deep foolishness it seems to me and speaking of deep foolishness one of the um\nMost outspoken opponents of the confirmation of justice capital was part of the one and only Cory Booker\nAnd he was out campaigning in Iowa why was he campaigning in Iowa is it because he is just enormously popular in Iowa does he have a\nFamily in Iowa I don't think so I don't know maybe this but why was Cory Booker and I always in Iowa because that's where the Democratic nomination process begins and his plan to win the presidency is he is going to be the most hysterical\nOr the most over the top the most ridiculous of all of the Democrats speaking now a lot of people said he's trying to follow the path blazed by Brock Obama who won the Iowa caucuses that was the beginning of his path to the presidency beat Hillary Clinton the Iowa caucus\nIs very different bronco Obama went to Iowa trying to show he was more reasonable more unified\nAnd I'm Cory Booker well Cory Booker\nGoes to Iowa and sounds like this\nLong until November [noise]\n\nEducation how\nWe\nHave what are you\nOn\nSpartacus I'm Sorry\nCan we listen to that again this is this is one of the most embarrassing political speeches of our time I'm an artist and it it's in Iowa the Iowa wasn't close this time Trump carried Iowa by nearly ten points it was it was wiped out\nAnd and Cory Booker\nThinks he's going to appeal to Iowa was is can we listen along with ...\nPlanned Parenthood than\nPublic education\n\nHave with our universe okay\nCorey yeah you should you should meet another yeah like a ... named Howard Dean I Know I don't\nFor a went to Oxford Stanford too and\nUh but seriously it is it didn't\nWork out so well for Howard Dean but how long\nOkay and and again he I Corey I Know has a strong Christian background he does he could have set a\nHow long oh lord how long I I Would prefer you echo the as a a passage that says come let us reason to cast her\nCory ... you can do better this and then wait same guy\nSpartacus is on the Senate floor and delivering his final that on the Asian of judge Kavanaugh on the Senate floor and more inspiring rhetoric from the gentleman from New Jersey\nSo a lot of folks our asking me what now\nOh one of them clued by reading some word from another painful period\nPeople didn't know what this body would do [noise]\nThere was just in this land and people didn't know what this body would do hundreds of\nHundreds of thousands came forward to march to protest interested in and they didn't know what this body would do to\nAnyway and they fought any way sometimes they were beaten in fact in one case on a bridge with Alabama they were beaten and bloody one of my colleagues and the other chamber John Lewis hadn't had split open but\nEventually got over that bridge and got to Montgomery in a man named king David speech to those people who are tempted to surrender to cynicism in that time\n... just finished with those people who want it to do up to do that I suppose people were hurting this is what he said\nAnd I quote he goes I Know you're asking today how long will it take\nAnd clerks end up having an enormous impact on a justice of the service for the first time ever the for law clerks new clerks or going to be\nServing justice Kavanaugh or Shannon grandma Megan Lacey Sarah Nome and son and Kim Jackson by the way that Kim as and female they're all\nWomen first time ever any justice ever has appointed all female clerks and by the way a he is now tied\nRuth Bader Ginsburg in the number of black law clerks working for him why because in her Thirty years on the court or Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nAnd saw quite Thirty years I Know the twenty five years on Ruth Bader Ginsburg has appointed exactly one black law clerk out of a hundred I'm Brett Kavanaugh was appointed one out of four\nFirst for better it's a nice thing\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six west in Philadelphia west and you're on the Michael ... or you hey\nLook I Want to start with a question okay sure\nAre yes or do you agree that it would be despicable\nTo make a false accusation against the person that would destroy his life of course okay art to them\nThat were agreed that it's not\nCory Booker is not acting crazy he's a despicable person all of these Democrats are despicable people Christine Blasey Ford's accusation has been totally proven to be false or or if not in any way demonstrably true she it's\nBeen okay that's that's a different thing she is ... ... how is she been shy of how she been shown to be a liar\nOkay she said she was afraid to fly obviously that's not the case\nWell wait wait wait that was as statement by one of her lawyer she did not say all and she was the question that her lawyers gave an isolating or how\nThe second door on her house was built because she she felt confine\nAgain but this is a this is this is a lot I you're right and and that's not something\nThat she said apparently something she led the put out there and her name I think we make a mistake if we wanted to attack a Dr Ford as some kind of despicable person I think she's\nI think I Do I Do question our credibility I don't think she has been tried and credible and any of this but I I think she may in one level believe it there was actually an argument about this involving a
