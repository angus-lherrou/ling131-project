I'm I Am getting over every time I watched Trump on television I'm thrilled about the ... nomination also\nWhat I object to is I think that we're packing the weaker argument when we go after these crazy than the lab who uh you know anybody can figure out well not anybody but everybody what\nWhat felt like my goodness can figure out that they're not playing for coming at it you know on on a on the right way whereas we shouldn't can gauge them on that playing field or the arguments I think is stronger than you know circling the whole uh\nThe all our justice system by by a\nClimbing this

but I feel I have here is that Mrs comments on feminism or wrong\nI thought he was going to differ with me have you been mentioned it folks please for the good of the show\nOne politician who gives you a different point of view\nWho says hey guess what we've got some problems that politics alone can fix\nIs the junior senator from Nebraska who I think has become by a large margin of advantage\nOr one of the most indispensable voices in the United States Senate his name is Ben Sasse a senator Sasse it's great to speak to\nMichael thank you for the ... and you're right about those words if I said anything like that a my BS meter would go off I wouldn't be able to protect you can save the world by politics but my wife would just whack me upside the head\nOkay and this is not to say that politics is unimportant in your new book which is hosted up at our website the book is called them\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal and it's already a best seller and it should be because the very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics didn't get us into this mess\nAnd politics isn't going to get us out what do you mean by that\n[noise] yeah so I'm sure we're gonna talk today about politics and why does matter so I don't want to mislead than ever your audience insane but it doesn't it truly does\nBut what we're going through right now even in the chaos in our politics really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are an economic and cultural history and we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lock the waves\nWere going to produce more total goods and services than the world has ever known and all of human history a partly because of the digital revolution but one of the things that it does is it enables humans to think that we can be ruthless at exactly the same time that we have lots of social science literature now confirming what people have\nKnown for millennia hum through philosophy of the allergy which has been rooted makes you happy do you have a family\nOr do you have a few deep friendships you have meaningful work do you have shared vocation give some projects with co workers in your community the local worshipping community if you have those things you tend to be happy that's about ... and get our technology of letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age this this rootless age and so\nTraditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace et cetera there and collapse and so we're trying to find meaning brand good and evil meaning in politics and it's not going to work\nAnd and this is I think an important point that I can as emphatically agree with is that part of what has happened here with a Americans believing venture either on our side or you're on the other side and the other side as pure evil in our side as pure good\nThat kind of political talk flows from the fact that people don't have more what used to be called normal\nUh relationships and support systems and so they look to politics I was thinking I did you follow the story senator I'm sure you did a of New York in Portland, Oregon there were fights in the streets between Proud Boys and antifa\nAnd and the two groups of of Todd's who seem to get great pleasure about actually being violent with one another and you follow that story\nI heard little bits and pieces of it but it's just so weird [laughter]\nWell it it seems weird because again the question is what are you going to accomplish how does it make life better if you beat up some uh if you're from anti than you beat up somebody from Proud Boys or if you're from ... and he beat up somebody from antifa\nHow does how does that help anybody it's kind of like the jets and the sharks except those gangs are kind of level\nRight exactly and they could sing uh it it turns out that you know if\nYou if you beat down people who disagree with you about politics you don't necessarily accomplish anything that's lasting by doing that they've been great quick hit a takedown it's good to just sort of\nA pontificate in front of an audience of people who already agree with you but you don't persuade anybody that way and so when people use all these war metaphor for politics I think it's sort of miss understands what we think of the American tradition politics are supposed to do\nPolitics maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that the really interesting communities can thrive and flourish the things that matter are the communities of love in your neighborhood where you persuade people to join with you in a project and there's a lot broken in our politics politics isn't serving those local community as well but\nA lot of the political chaos and discord we face really is downstream I think from the collapse of these more natural or tribes of affection and community and you know your your point about um the loneliness a lion you used there are half as many friends in America\nAre in the last twenty seven years what does that mean\nSocial science data showed that in Nineteen Ninety the average American had about three points to friends the average American today has about one point eight friends half as many forty percent of Americans have either zero or only one Koch to not into all there was a loneliness ... out there\nAnd a whole bunch of people go to politics saying at least I can figure out how to have a um an enemy with somebody else and that will make me feel like I'm On a team but it doesn't really work\nWe're speaking with Senator Ben Sasse a senator a Republican conservative Republican from Nebraska his book a new book is called them why we hate each other and how to heal\nUm let me try to make a case and you can bet it down if you choose a that that part of the healing process has to be making sure Republicans when the house of representatives this time I think we're going to hold the Senate\nOr where you work but we need to hold the house of representatives and the the reason that I Would put that in terms of healing\nIs the Democrats have already announced that if they take over the house they're going to be pushing the impeachment of justice Kavanaugh and they're going to be pushing the impeachment of President Trump\nThat we're going to have investigations and politics of destruction and this incredible hateful bitterness\nThen we all saw during the Kavanaugh hearings that's going to go on and on and on so the only way to prevent that is to make sure that you don't hand over the house of representatives to these ... mean spirited hostile and very destructive folks\n[noise] yeah so let me uh overwhelmingly agree and then also offer one tweak so the the overwhelming agreement is\nI'm I'm Out there raising money for Republican candidates I'm I'm writing checks I'm campaign and what people are so I absolutely want the Republican among us to not just a ... extend our majority and the fact that I Want the Republicans to win and the house um\nBut at the ... after that I felt the same time the second or third most conservative voter out of a hundred and the U.S Senate so if you look at anybody score card on on who the most conservative senator I'm always in the top half dozen of everybody scorecard so I'm not in different uh on political matters and the this is not an argument hey let's just all thing can buy off\nAnd how much you metal there's really nobody more conservative than I Am\nBut I think we need to recognize that because the Democrats in the house might do something incredibly stupid and tried to impeach everybody under the sun or if they take the house\nStopping that from happening is not actually the same thing as healing it's just stopping a further slide into this political tribalism I think that the healing that's gonna satisfy people is\nIn a world where job duration is getting shorter and shorter and by the way economically that's pretty great we're producing more and more a smart humans with brains are figuring out ways to produce more goods and services are more cost effective way that anybody has in the past that's great\nBut it means average duration data from I was born in Nineteen Seventy two average tuition at a farm in the seventies was about two and a half decades for a primary breadwinner today it's four point two years and getting shorter\nOne of the things that means is you don't have relationships with your co workers that last over the course of a lifetime\nAnd nails in particular aren't actually good at forming new relationships after about twenty five to Thirty years old and so we've got a lot more loneliness and the country politics can fix that problem rebuilding their neighborhood is what we have to do to fix that problem and this book is about fifty percent constructive about what do I do to rebuild in my neighborhood how do I do I joined in with\nA local civic organizations that made them more likely to know the person who lives two doors away from me because that's actually highly correlated with being happy\nAnd uh that's one of the big focuses in them or the new book by Senator Ben Sasse it's post at our website at Michael ... dot com\nOr a senator you you're also a very outspoken very deeply committed Christian man of faith and you do talk about uh the the need really for people to go to the center of communal affiliation which traditionally has been congregations here in this country\nWhat's gone wrong with the church do you think and with with synagogues or have that that has caused this sort of this affiliation particularly among young people\nWell fed so I think there are two or three different things happening at the same time\nI'm In in the same way that deep friendship and stick a nuclear families and shared work are heavily connected to place worshipping communities are as well\nThat we we know in the literature now what makes people happy do you have a family them if your friends do you think your work is meaningful and do you have a philosophical theological for a more to make sense of death or suffering\nThat drives happy that but one of the other things that happens in your local worshipping community is you're with people in an intergenerational context overtime\nAnd it turns out that I've got two teenage daughters and then the younger side as well but teenagers live the most generationally segregated lives that anybody has ever lived in human history\nThey really think the accident of birth year defines almost all the people they should associate with\nHow how do how do we fix that I Want to get to that with Senator Ben Sasse his new book is them why we hate each other and how they feel there's so much in this book about where we can go not just in politics of course but in our personal and economic lives will be right back with Senator Ben Sasse\nFor some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more is what they want well they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve long term problems they're trying to make politics the center of gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids are from the American future a speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group we had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when it's going to you today a talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is nonpartisan and you and a camera on there's only one house in the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\n[noise] they do a ... there's less sense of preening constantly for the cameras and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reasons I as one of the most conservative or senators of the United states elected from here\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican legislature people do not officially ... really parties and argue that camera all our one one house a state legislature and so\nWhat people are mostly doing is wrestling with ... gr term pragmatic question how do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bill that's cost effective\nUh there's less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil or for people who might have slightly different priorities of which bridge in which highway to find it's a much healthier thing to do bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by ... if if federal politics do what they should be an American constitutional hooked up with your main paint a framework for ordered liberty approaching the idea that people are created with dignity and the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shared project to secure those rights\nGovernment is the author of sorts right then government could do a small number of big things\nOr we need to build the fiber strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what's meaningful can happen back in communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nWhat ... what a concept change from the bottom up not the top down that's part of the theme of them why we hate each other and how to heal is the new bestseller by Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska\nAll I can say is keep it up senator we need you there in Washington and across the country as a book is posted up at our website at\nMichael med dot com we'll be right back with more on a

much and going up dangerously and President Trump addressed that yesterday's asked every federal department to do a five percent cut which should go a long way to at least slowing the growth in the deficit\nBut one thing to do here is a line which is that because the tax cuts the government is taking in less money\nThat the tax cuts of a lead to less revenue\nActually read the new wind up revenue went up not much but it was already high but revenue went out of the most recent since the tax cuts of of come in by zero point four percent to name for it\nIt's not a reduction how do I know

a day or\nThe statistician say not so long from now where the majority of children will be born into unwed families now there are a couple of reasons why\nThis situation is dire\nAnd they're in a couple of other reasons why it may not be quite as dire as we would suppose\nBut let me first I give you some of the background or that is put together through a new report from yup you've got to the United nations the United nothing and it also puts America's problems in the context of the rest of the world if you believe it's no problem at all\nThat we have almost half of the children born in the United states born into an married couple or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number\nThe story from Bloomberg an increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage signaling cultural signaling cultural and economic shifts that are here to stay according to a major new report from the United nations\nForty percent of all births in the U.S now occur outside of wedlock\nThat is up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy\nWas that means to put it in context is that in in less than fifty years the rate of out of wedlock birth has gone up for a hundred percent\nWhy would that be this a report was issued\nThat often a parent would die in the trial would or maybe you have to live with her grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded\nIn in the day after these trends\nBut what does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends of sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI Would say that we need government programs horse that would help\nThat would uh specifically be tailored to kids living in a single parent situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters the ... government day care centers\nI think over ... ... would be one way I think mariners where you dip your pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay let me just mention something to you Bob\nI I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what there are some times families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children\nAnd their financially press is it fair that people like that we're having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nI I Know you're going to hate this book or I or I'm going to say this we should cut defense spending because it's just it's just not necessary and we should also raised taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the and opinion most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs are the worst one of the things that has happened in this country has been shown by a wealth of books and information\nAh there is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that that blew the lid off the welfare system and the way the welfare system as it had been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society actually encouraged out of wedlock birth\nAnd they're Democrats who've written about that Daniel Patrick Moynihan who was a moderate Democrats [noise]\nRose about the problems with family structure in the United states and he predicted exactly where we are [noise] the government

think it's ... totally legitimate to say that one of the tactics the Democrats have used in this campaign that is unique to this campaign\nIs basically dispatching mobs some of which we understand are affiliated with organizations that are well funded\nTo disrupt Republican events to get into people's faces too uh basically misbehave and contribute to this atmosphere of violence and confrontation\nJake says pretty sad to hear you get on the mob train I've never had much or any respect for you well thank you are but I thought you were above that\nWas anyone calling the Tea Party protestors in two thousand Thirteen a mom\nIt's a talking point Michael and you can't be above that nonsense if you partake in it okay\nHere's the challenge to up there and I'll take calls on it can you give me an example where any of the Tea Party sessions acted like a mom\n\nYou tried to shout someone down where they tried to disrupt something I mean when you're talking about mom they think about those code paying more ons\nWho continually continually continual it was literally several times in our disrupted the Kavanaugh hearings who flooded congressional offices one of the hallmarks of the Tea Party and I saw with my own eyes\nThese are people who clean up after themselves they wouldn't have giant rallies and a giant march on Washington one that was run by Glenn Beck I think they have two hundred thousand people there that a ton of people\nAnd they made a very big point of asking people to pick up their litter and you can compare that to the inauguration crown or any inauguration crowd you cannot compare and the same way that very very regularly\nA there would be people dispatched to conservative political rallies and he asked this includes Trump rallies\nTry to disrupt than just shout and to be\nCarried away I it I won't say it never happens but it's very rarely happens with liberal candidates do you remember a time when when Hillary was forced to confront angry people chanting at her\nOr President Obama I I Do remember there were a couple of cases where President Obama had a heckler and he handled it very well in very classy and fine but it's so rare\nAnd uh again right now in this campaign\nYou have major political figures like the if the Democrats take over the house of representatives Maxine Waters Los Angeles will be the chair of the

your calls to Jake in Philadelphia Jake you're on the show it's disagreement day\nThey're like oh I disagree with your use of a term anti Semitism it should be anti Judaism and hatred of Jews and their religious\nWell no uh because of Hitler made a a very big point of killing people including people who were Jews would converted to Catholicism or there there's a saint of the Catholic Church who was a former Jewish communist intellectual ...\nHello what Hitler's friend or the semi the mafia of Jerusalem\nOkay right I ... I understand but the term anti Semitism was originally coined in Europe in central direct by a hold on hold on and it was coined by people to describe a hatred of Jews and you're right the Jews have been Europeans for a long time\nBut this argument about a ... whether it is they will ... aren't good as it is not a\nReligious argument that goes down to religion\nIt does not go down to religion you heard that I I'm ... I'm Sorry sir they are\nFrom the church it started from the church fathers\nOkay it it did not start from the church fathers had started long before that if you read about the book investor which dramatizes events in the fifth century bc of there was a very classic anti Semitism by Hayman who wanted to wipe out all the Jews\nAnd the notion that this is all about religion would not explained the fact that very secular Jews\nHave also been targeted by anti Semitism bid leaving the Jewish religion\nAnd taking the Jewish religion very un seriously I did not protect people at all from the
