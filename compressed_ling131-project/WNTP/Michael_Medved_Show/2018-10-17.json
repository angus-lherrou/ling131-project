{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "But honestly the vice president he really did enjoy the set of the number of times he said we've got to make this an annual thing\nA because he he actually enjoyed the the goofing us you know I I was worried about ...\n[laughter]\nI think even speaking half the time why everybody here you know what's good for your book Donald drain the swamp by Eric ... is the illustrator\nHe not only is he the illustrator but I wrote it with him Tim ranked one eye or creative partners we've done a number of books together people look it up online some of the most beautiful illustrations you've ever seen or his books but when I\nReally was thinking about who do I vote he's the guy that convinced me to take Trump's seriously he said this guy is a folk hero he's an American folk hero and that's what gave me the idea to write the book\nDonald drained the swamp I said he's a larger than life figure I Need to write a kids' book or a or I mean this is the kids but but it's also humor book for adults in other words adults are going to find humor in this children's book\nThat kids aren't going to find I mean obviously there's a there's a little blue bird that tweets are there is a there's somebody you know the first swamp creature is the lobbyists or is I mean kids are not going to get that and uh and then there's another swamp creature that looks a heck of a lot\nLike a crying Chuck\nI don't know if you've heard of crying truck but he's a senator for yeah shortly yeah or they're going to charge and then there's the the the biggest bad a swamp creature of them all the Georgia saw us\nAnd you know adults will get that\nBut kids I think I'm part of this book really is that I think\nWe who have supported this president\nWe need to have some fun we need to celebrate\nAnd we need to have something a narrative that's a positive narrative about what's going on we don't need to be in the weeds every day with all the details and everything we need to just say something good is happening in America and by the way most people understand that we're being reconnected to our government were never supposed to have a big bloated\nBureaucracy we're supposed to be a free people who govern ourselves\nThat's what this big his book is all about and I really think it's important that we remind ourselves of that and we teach our kids what that is and so this is a fable about American style self government\nFeaturing a caveman name Donald and the swamp creatures and all that kind of stuff I mean I have to say it's sweet it's innocent it's not mean spirited so I Hope people will will will use it to teach their kids but also just for adults to have fun I think a lot of adults are going to give this to other adults I Hope\nConservative adults will give it to a to they're never Trump or friends you know just as a joke or something because it is not mean spirited meant for us all to to laugh\nNow it's a total for them it's called Donald Jr H drain the swamp I it's probably the only book or at least be only one I Know of certainly\nA for a pug positive you president and\nIt it's just a in a very far away it's ... it's ... it's a Donald became man book as a as a series of Donald ... years going on I think\nThe next one is going to be Donald builds the wall or whether Congress gives them funding or not\nA you know that kind of thing but I'm I think there will be other books he lives in Michael Dell of my pillow we're creating pillows based on this book that's not a joke that's actually true we're creating a plush dial\nIt's going to go get getting crazy Dennis it's getting crazy but people once you buy your make America great hat\nYou know ... that's about it right and so I thought we need to have something just a fun thing or you know so we can celebrate what is happening and it's not it's not a bitter thing it's it's ... it's a bipartisan swamp if you're a careful reader of the illustrations I Can't get too specific but it's a bipartisan swamp\nAnd you know it's it's meant to be happy and fun\nWhile it is absolutely aren't going to be a Governor McDonnell dream is wrong\nWhy what caused you to even come up with this idea\nWell honestly I\nI was mentioning Tim rag when he's he's my friend of Thirty years and he's the one that that really made me see that I that I was missing something with Trump he said this guy's a folk hero and Tim and I've written all these children's books together and after the election I thought you know what I Wonder holy cow I should write a book with him\nLike a kids' book for ... with Donald as a folk hero I didn't know what the idea was but it just kind of jumped into my head like ideas sometimes do and I knew immediately it was a good idea and I had to do it but I didn't know what it was going to be and I kept talking to him about it and he wasn't getting it and I saw\nThis doesn't make sense he's the guy that that made me

caveman book you are one versatile do ...\nI wanted to prove to the world that people will say these different things about me and I wanted people to see that I also have a shallow side\nIn the first time in a very very long time we will get to that story [noise]\nAh there's also a very good news just broke moments ago from\nThe White House about\nFulfilling something that I had been pushing for for a while on this show and I'm very glad to see it it's a cold and across the board budget cuts spending cuts for every federal departments that President Trump is apparently planning to demand and as president he can demand it\nPut and triggered a global economic slowdown economic recovery is well underway with the global economy protected to grow almost four\nPercent in two thousand Eighteen in two thousand and Nineteen said the report that uh was published\nA last night by the organization that produces the Davos conference on global politics and economics okay you might say well what does this have to do with my life everything\nBecause a more competitive economy means more jobs that means higher wages and means more prosperity it means more freedom\nBecause frankly if you have more options in terms of the jobs you look for in the way that you are in your living and the way that you can invest what ever dollars you can save\nIf if you have more choices that is the equivalent to more freedom\nAnd then there's this uh President Trump actually just talked about this at a a White House meeting and a ... this is uh what what President Trump or because the media was just held he\nAnnounced in advance that he was going to make a demand from his cabinet secretaries\nAnd here is what that demand sounded like just moments ago\nI'm going to pay tribute to come back\nA five percent budget cuts\nFrom fuel various departments whether it's a secretary of the British straight or whatever\nI Would ask everybody to come back with a five percent cuts for are they actually they I think it will be able to do is they may be a special exemption perhaps\nWho that exemption would be if you can do more than five some of you will say hey I can do much for the uh you know\nI've heard about the penny for Fifteen Years one penny every year for a dollar one Betty every year after four or five years the countries in good shape\nOf saying what's up through the ... of the five but it was [noise] I think you can do it so I'd like to have everyone who city around the table\nFor your incredible domains that you've presided over so we're really in some cases some cases very well some cases where there's like\nI Would like you to come back with a a five percent\nOr get rid of the fact\nOf the way\nAnd I'm sure you can do it I'm sure everybody has to say what can the\nOkay this is terrific and this is one of the best moments for the president's so far in my opinion one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the only thing that I Would add and and I feel\nKind of emboldened to do this because this is something that we've talked about on the show we talked about a recently we've talked about a month ago it was necessary it was great the president is right on target\nThere's one thing he could add which is I'm going to set the example\nAnd I'm going to cut my White House budget I'm going to cut it right now and we're going to come back to you and the same time on all of you to come back and show them not cutting just five percent I'm cutting ten percent and by the way it is easy to cut the White House budget by ten percent there too many darn\nPeople who worked in the White House near stumbling over one another by the way one of the good things about Trump is he has an appointed people to fill all of those useless jobs at the White House wants a useless jobs you have a whole offices with\nA director and then an associate director and then various secretaries for things like the office of White House\nLiaison to the disabled community now this is not that this the disabled community but there's no reason there are other\nGovernment apartments that deal with that health and Human Services has a huge commitment of that\nYou don't need a special White House office there is a special White House office was damaged by President Clinton to deal with the algae Beatty community why it's not necessary\nThat doesn't mean that access should be divide the denied the algae Beatty people look there's this special White House office to deal with the Jewish community\nAnd I benefited from it because I had during the Bush administration they wouldn't have a Hanukkah party and it was a lovely thing\nKeep up the Hanukkah party but you don't need a special White House liaison you don't need a special White House and Ponte you don't need somebody drawing a government salary they can talk this back we have a deficit right now seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it went up Seventeen percent since last year it's not because of the Republican tax cuts\nIf you actually look at this and you read some of the hysterical democratic articles\nThey make it clear revenues have not gone down sharply if anything they may have gone up very slightly they basically been stable what's gone up has been spending and yes it's true as Mitch McConnell made the point yesterday that much of that spending about half of it is three big federal programs Mitch McConnell\nMade a little bit of misstatement he said that the Seventy percent of the federal budget is Medicare Medicaid and Social Security it's not Seventy percent it's about fifty percent\nIf you add on an interest on the national debt and a bunch of other social program than it gets up to Seventy percent but still the the point is that there is room for cutting the federal deficit we highlighted some of the programs some of the stupid spending that has really crippled our country\nNow that does not include however spending to get a new ambassador to Saudi Arabia this is something that President Trump could look into a do I believe that President Trump is to blame for the killing of ... of course not\nAnd this is a ridiculous ... liberal\nBasically incantation and if they say it or not they said enough it might be true and now it's not true do I think President Trump is doing a great job on Saudi Arabia and not so much but it's going to be okay it's going to be OK if he keeps in mind certain facts and priorities about our relationship\nWith his desert ... by the way is that desert kingdom for those enlightened play tonic wonderful but no this is a brutal and corrupt autocracies [noise] so how do you deal with it will get to that and your calls coming up on the ... [noise]\nBut it's considered a cut if you cut the rate of increase but you're entirely correct I think what President Trump has in mind here\nIs each of the federal departments is allotted a set amount of money and not say you have a a government bureau department that has a has a budget of a hundred billion dollars well that budget cut would mean you find five billion dollars to say\nBut you're you're right to bring this up to and thanks for the call\nLet's go to I'm\nMark in Columbus ohio mark you're on the Michael Mann that show\nHow thank you sir I really appreciate your ah your parents in a region across the aisle you or your ah your\nRegular view of America really appreciate\nThat thank you [noise] um yeah when you say a President Trump should lead by example he really are [noise]\nAh I mean once you said yourself a ... he's already left opposition was open on field as the as are some people would say and and ... them alone I think she she uh I mean the numbers are incredible\nIt's something like a a the previous administration had a hundred and twenty five and blow away of twenty five\nI was going to bring us point up the your ear entirely on the right track uh Michelle Obama had a staff of sixteen the twenty four people depending on when and her eight years as first lady\nMoney has a staff of nine but you don't want ... Milan you could make do with a staff of seven [laughter] don't you think [laughter] and ... and and seriously because this whole thing about getting first ladies big staff\nIs is relatively new and uh and the point is you're right Trump has left a bunch of White House positions unfilled\nAnd good for him but I'm ... the whole idea when people talk about turmoil in the White House there would be less turmoil if there were less people working there fewer people working there and I I think that's very very clear I um\nI wrote a book about this a long time ago it was at the time that it came out which was a very long times forty years ago the time it came out last thirty nine that time that shadow presidents came out it was the first comprehensive history of the White House staff up to that time\nAnd it's shocking a President Lincoln won the civil war\nWith the White House staff of two that tried to it was him and to assistance because he had a cabinet as well now I'm not saying that presidents should try to deal with the White House staff too but he could probably make do with the White House staff of two hundred and we'll be right back [noise]\nMichael ...

instance I Can't believe I made the front page of the New York times with everything else we have going on and budget deficits and foreign policy crises and the mid term election coming up what do they focus on the fact that the President Trump used the term horse face\nThe idea that this is somehow associated with Trump is ridiculous what President Trump has done since he's been president has been to encourage exactly the kind of change in Saudi Arabia that we have known that we've needed for a long time and you know who acknowledges\nThis it's a Tom Friedman doubled Pulitzer Prize winner in the New York times big liberal but she at least as honest enough to recognize that all all of a sudden\nSaying oh we have to blow up our relationship with Saudi Arabia and who cares about their oil he's right the biggest thing isn't their oil\nThe biggest thing is Saudi Arabia's role in reforming Islam\nBecause one hottest Islam which used to emanates from Saudi Arabia was precisely the kind of danger that led to the worst thing that's happened in most of our memories which has nine eleven and right now say what you want to ban him\nMohammed bin Salman NBS has been working to rein that in and to change it let me read you some of what a Friedman rights today in the New York times\nHe says I defined our most important national interest in Saudi Arabia since nine eleven and it's not an oil is not arms sales is not standing up to Iran Islamic religious reform which when come only from Saudi Arabia the home of his lumps holiest cities making Medina\nI Believe nine eleven was the worst thing to happen to American my lifetime writes Tom Friedman we've spent thousands of lives and some two trillion trying to defuse the threat of Muslim extremists from ... to ISIS dollars that could have gone to many other needs in our society\nAnd I believe the roots of nine eleven came from too terrible bargains one was that bargain between the Saudi ruling family and the kingdom's religious establishment where each bless the other\nThe other was America's cynical bargain with the Saudis which went like this guy's just keep your oil pumps open your prices low and don't bother the Israelis too much and you can do whatever you want out back\nPreach whatever hate you want in your mosques print whatever conspiracy theories you want in your papers and treat your women however you want\nAnd he said so what\nCaught my eye most about Mohammed bin Salman and made me most hopeful was his tentative willingness to engage in a war of ideas with his religious hardliners declaring publicly do not right that we are re interpreting Islam we're restoring Islam to its origins\nMohammed bin Salman was the guy who saw to it that women can suddenly are allowed to drive\nIn Saudi Arabia that's a a big big deal he um\nHe also was argued publicly that Islam and its origins was tolerant of others face and empowering of women and open to new ideas\nAnd the whole idea that somehow whatever follows Mohammed bin Salman is going to be better\nI think it's foolish and yes there has to be a strong response and this has to be condemned and they're going to have to be people who are punished for this this was a gross crime but the idea that somehow you're going to create instability in Saudi Arabia the cost would\nBe terrible not only in terms of our foreign policy and our confrontation with Iran but in terms of this entire need the Friedman is right to point to which is the need to reform\nIslam's most destructive tendencies and let's go quickly to Jason in Honolulu you're on the Michael my bed show hey Jason\nI think for taking the call I'm now going to comment about the economics and and everything but I I ah Fisher on this topic now I just want to quickly said yesterday on your show\nOr were you when you ran into a recording of the person that fact that America is no longer are in the traditional stance of the leader free world you after that I met with you some more agreed with that and ah\nI have to tell you I wholeheartedly agree with that I I Know Trump is taken lightly different bands and maybe George W. Bush I understand that but I like to share power ... show and all of a ...\n... ... if you dropped the largest bombing ever\nIn the history of mankind so I think he's actually taken a a pretty good leadership role\nAnd okay I'm I'm not sure if that bomb achieved what it was meant to do and by the way it it was the largest in terms of size not in terms of impact I mean there's still the biggest bombs were dropped or sell those little teeny tiny Adam bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that killed more than a hundred thousand people each\nWe will be right back up with more in perspective on leadership in the free world and what it means what am I going to eventually [noise]\nNine million into conservative talk\nWith blinds dot com getting ready for the holidays doesn't have to mean taking out a second mortgage brand new made to order custom blinds from blinds dots\nA she has also been involved with all kinds of controversy over projects you assume such a\nPerson a was clearly on the left and I did have nothing to talk about\nExcept that's not the case when you're talking about Comey on polio\nA communal pony as a best selling author a she has a provocateur\nAnd I think that many of our listeners will find themselves in substantial agreement with Camille ... and her new book it's called provocations is a collection of her pieces and observations\nFor twenty five years and by the way one of the observations that she makes with which I agree very emphatically is the notion that we have a problem in our higher education system and an education at all levels because of the blind spot toward religion\nAs you take that position\nWell it was to me and you describe yourself as an atheist right\nCorrect I I'm an atheist but I I I completely respect religion as a profound system of meaning okay but there is a metaphysical system\nAnd I think that you know one of our the major problems right now is that in our in our era of secular humanism we have saw our most educated elite having transferred out the need for religion\nInto politics so people look at at their political affiliation to party affiliation is in some way salvation ill or they they they see the world in terms of of good versus evil and and that's what's ... and that has produced this at\nThis unbelievable hysteria that I think is so destructive\nTo especially the young people is going on ... the emanating from DC\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number ... new book a provocations which is the definitive Camille Paul your collection is posted up at our website at Michael midday dot com\nOr to me like I I Do have to ask you because you write about this or do you believe that the hash tag me too movement has been an unmitigated blessing and it is liberated America from all kinds of dangerous and horrible things [noise]\n... ah I I think it's important to a as a feminist to have the the issue of of sexual abuse and taken seriously by\nAbout right now I think the movement has been hijacked by hysterics and and and people who are who are really mentally disordered and we're having a return to that that horrible period of the Nineteen seventies when my pro sex wing of feminism was fighting against the ... and people like Andrew Adwok and saw all of a heterosexual\nIntercourse as rape or an end with this ... this like man hating theme which is run through second wave feminism not my\nThing is the perfect swing a feminist or one in the Nineteen nineties and we thought that we had finally we had defeated all these like\n... Britannica the which called OK hysterics in uh the Gloria Steinem aside from a feminism but now now it's back thanks to the whole saturation of higher education with um with gender studies at the allergy which does not\nKnowledge sexual differences which which what their gender studies professors of never studied that page of biology and the doctor nation is going on and on our campuses cannot be believed\nDo you think that that's related to the fact that ah Christina hot summers and others have written very persuasively about what a difficult time young men are having why is that it's getting we're very close to now two thirds of the bachelor's degrees of the four year college degrees are coming up we're going to go to women or\nDo you think the male failure or relatives failure
