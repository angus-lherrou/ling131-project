I'm ... I'm a national is too I I Am and I I don't understand why people should have a problem with that word if you want to try to answer that question you can one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nLook I um I just finished my very [laughter] lengthy too lengthy I'm afraid chapter on Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt is regularly rated as one of the greatest of all American presidents he's on Mount Rushmore\nWhen he ran for president in Nineteen twelve he called his program the new nationalism and\nUh that was and then and then ... Woodrow Wilson who was running against him was so a compelled at theater Roosevelt campaigning on this idea of a new nationalism that he came up with his own program called the new freedom\nIn any event there is nothing\nWrong with the term nationalism is there but if you look at the dictionary or you just Google it or anything it look it up what are the sentiments for nationalism here the first three Senate\nPatriotism patriotic feeling and flag waving okay is there something wrong with that I I Am not\nEntirely comfortable with President Trump using the term global as derisive Lee I don't know anyone I honestly do not know anyone who describes himself or herself as a global it\nUm and at a a ... and ... and that's a word that's problematic that that's but that's not what people are freaking out about\nWhat people are freaking out of that as President Trump saying he's a nationalist for instance here is Don Lemon reacting almost in real time just moments after President Trump dropped the N. word John Lennon on CNN [noise]\nI'm a nationalist\nUse that word we're gonna talk about that word tonight it is a favor to be All right and is loaded with native is and racial undertones and global as well global is I've been uses a slur\nOf of sorts sometimes even against those and the administration often with anti Semitic overtone\nWhich just happened to make the president come right out and embrace nationalism\n[noise] okay what is the problem with nationalism a a nationalist\nOr nationalism and this is a again common definition a personal advocates Political Independence for a country patriotic feeling principles are efforts an extreme form of this especially marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries\nAnd then a patriot her patriotism that's listed as a person who vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies are detractors vigorous support for one's country in other words that's why patriot patriotism is listed as a synonym for nationalism\nAnd um [noise] do I think this is may be part of a political strategy for him to help a push the Republicans over the line and hold the house of representatives in some of these furious house races\nI kind of think Trump just set it\nBut maybe it is maybe it is and I'll tell you why because for ordinary Americans I I mean\nBasically the people who live in this country and yet that includes those all important suburban women\nYou hear that the president said I'm a nationalist ... what is so terrible about that and ah the\nChrysalis are rights on his face Trump seemed to be simply saying that well past presidents and politicians cared a lot about other countries and what other countries thought about the United states that he cares primarily about the U.S and what is good for us\nThe problem of course is that words matter and the American president referring to himself as a national says all sorts of problems wrapped up in it\nLet's start with what nationalism means\nHere's the definition that he found it says quote a sense of national consciousness exalted him one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on the promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or super national groups\nProblem there\nAs we do not elect a president of the United states to be a citizen of the world or a public servant for the world we do not we elect a president to represent the United states and\nTo defend our country and to defend our constitution and yes to defend our culture and there is such a thing as American culture now the term white nationalist\nOr if I dare say so the term black nationalist which is also a term that that's a problem let me tell you why it's a problem because what that suggests is that your real nation is something other than the United states\nThe United states obviously has nationalist about America patriots who serve our country who fight for our country who worked for our country of every racial religious\nAnd or ethnic background it it it does and the idea that\nThere is something racist about saying I Am a nationalist America specifically and from the beginning has always\nBeen a nation that has not defined our nationalism or our nationality based upon race or blood or where you were born I mean\nGoing all the way back to before the revolution the idea was you could become an American by choice by picking yourself up and moving here and embracing the American idea\nAnd we've always had that we've always had that and you know we we talked\nOn this show many times and and it is true it is documented nobody argues against is close to ten percent and maybe over ten percent of the continental army that fought with George Washington\nFor our liberty where people of color they were black people mostly former slaves because that's why they were here and the idea\nOf this at the French there actually recorded descriptions of when the French arrived to work with the Americans at Yorktown one of the reasons they look down on the American army was not only not speak the uniforms and the French were about nothing if not spit uniforms\nBut because there were so many people of different complex and in that army [noise] one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nDo you have a problem with nationalism does that mean you have a problem with America\nBully right back on the ... [noise]\nYour outlet for outrage time not going to remind them might be [noise]\nNo and we have to come together and fight it and that's why this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me\nI don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named your um how zoning [noise] and it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes\nIs that nationalism goes pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is\nYou are real tribe then the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means is that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to Theodore Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliation which you care about what were you and give your heart to is our nation\nNot a race not an ethnicity and the fact that\nThat there are so many people out there and the commentary and and so many Democrats who don't get that who were offended by the term nationalism\nI honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side I think if anything it helps on the conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just offended by the word nationalism give me a call and tell me why\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six I'm Michael in San Diego you're on the Michael ...\nMichael I I'm a I think that uh America is neither a a a country founded on\nNationalism nor international is a ... or a globalism and how can\nYou say that we weren't hounded on nationalism\nA we were founded on an individual is on nationalism\nOr no no I'm Sorry we were we were founded by a lot of people who came together to a risk their lives and in many cases to give their lives at twenty five thousand people died in the revolution give their lives for the cause of the ... a nation nonsense not a school board a nation stay with\nMe if I Want to let you answer back I Will continue what's wrong with nationalism honestly I think it's a beautiful thing and needed in this country and probably around the world tell you why coming up\nAnd I'm quoting here insane\nCatastrophic chaos so Michael Vick show some of the more polite words [noise]\nUsed or nine Ninety One intelligent conservative talk\n[noise] for that sort of news eyeball I knew in Washington President Trump shows are Democrats take the house or the upcoming midterm elections Americans can expect their taxes go\nUp you also told a very large campaign gathering when I started here to the Democrats probably one of the country with millions of illegal immigrants Sandra Day O'Connor the first woman on the U.S Supreme Court so she has a beginning stages of dementia in a statement she released they she said it is quote probably all fibers disease\nAnd notes that she will now be removing herself from a public wife and spoke about her gratitude for her many opportunities shoes with joy does that American\nYou weren't stocks what broadly in early trading today to undergo Dow Jones industrial average down more than five hundred points early on as investors group unsettled by the prospects\nTry to call the ... and the costs for President Trump's ongoing a trade war would try to at least a war of words right now the Dow was coming back though it's down just sixty two points this is Esther and do\nYou\nTalk nine ... times they were trying to find somebody stand up the cancer jammed up late to the vice should expressway until at least on the ...

... my pillow dot com or you called them an eight hundred three to six to eight oh\nThat's eight hundred three to six to eight oh let me go back to Michael in San Diego a and and Michael was making the point that he thought that America was based on individual is not nationalism go ahead\nYeah I um I Would say that America was founded on each individual's right to their own life his own liberty and the pursuit of happiness which were rather Lucian airy concept [noise] ah apple\nPie ... do you know what the next sentence is in the declaration\nAre life liberty and happiness and ... and who and to secure these rights secure these rights governments are instituted among men among men yeah Iraq\nOn another one so the idea of government that's what they were doing they were setting up a government to secure these rights but doing it as and the last words the declaration isn't so we pledge to one another our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor\nIn other words the the whole idea of creating a new nation or it involves nationalism because the recognition that Jefferson had and all the founders had\nIs that without a nation without a government without some kind of social structure anarchy simply doesn't work\nAnd there are no rights unless a government exists to protect them so this is one of those things I understand people have gotten a very very bad taste from government meddling in big government and certainly\nIn the twentieth century there were monstrous examples of a governmental tyranny particularly in the communist world and a Nazi world elsewhere\nBut the idea that this somehow reflect badly on nationalism and there was a guy named saying Shonda crop of core who uh wrote a book defining what this New America was and he begins by saying who is this American this new man\nNational exit racial implications for the American since there was used in mind that no nothing is a New York and he's making sixty was used to exclude the Irish the Germans used it to move the Jews\nThat the known things the things used the term native as they did not use the term nationalist a lot and the journal and the whole United on hold on the the point about this is can we recognize that American nationalism from the beginning of the country\nHas been different because it has not been based on race in other words the ... and ... and German nationalism\nA such as it is it all very complicated there's a I have a a a tweet that came out uh basically defending Hitler in order to condemn Trump that we have to get to in a moment\nBut ah at Hitler wasn't even German he was Austrian and that's why his nationalism that he talked about was all racial and based on race but\nWell it's interesting you mentioned the French because that's the route French nationalism is the root of job and it was a much obviously as negative implications\nWell know showman is um is is different because show that is is a ... who is associated with it is considered an\nExtreme form of nationalism now if you take an extreme form of nationalism ah where are you you were insisting that you're in\nNation must rule the whole world problematic but one of the points that the people who've written about this make and in defense of nationalism and in defense of identity is that if you don't have a nation defining who you are\nAnd do you define who you are based upon race or ethnic background\nOr something other than a a national inheritance or a national cause\nIt's far more dangerous and far more toxic\nAnd a ... in terms of a ... Lincoln was a profound nationalist and would have had no problem with that term at all as I mentioned knees or President Roosevelt or had any problem with it and in fact Theodore Roosevelt embrace that term\nVery enthusiastically bully for him in a Nineteen twelve\nAppreciate your call let's go to Diane in Cleveland Diane you're on the Michael ...\nI like I really enjoy your show and I absolutely agree with everything that you said I did about history teacher I don't have to be an infinite ... through my accent could it be because of the rights of nationalism and the way they can only Nineteen hundred is what really that\nI'm a Europeans with the ...

that was supposed to be drowning all conservative hopes\nJohn Fund who writes about politics as well as just about anybody\nAnd has followed the politics of ... he he's also an expert because he wrote the book on it literally on the question of voter fraud and manipulating elections John is a a columnist for National Review he has a contributor at Fox News\nAnd he has why is the blue wave looking more like\nA splash then it's non me that's his latest piece it in our National Review John thanks very much for coming on the show a pleasure my love always okay right now uh uh and\nHow many states approximately are people all ready and sending in balance of course here in the state of Washington people are because it's all vote by mail\nThirty states have some form of early voting whether it's happening to your uh you know showing up at a government office before the election\nOkay so let me put the word out to people anyone listening to us right now in one of those thirty eight states and you probably are\nAs don't wait sending your ballot get it done that way you make sure you're making a contribution\nTo this important national decision the consensus seems to be on the part of everybody who's looking at this John Fund is that the momentum seemed to turn around in a Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\n[noise] well I think a lot of people have big in the cake any negative attitudes they had the President Trump and I think the trumps anthrax\nAs a personality had depressed part of the Republican base but the Kavanaugh hearings\nBrought out the ugliness of the left their complete disregard for normal procedures and rules and the rule of law\nI think that at best that show the Democrats to be the equal of Trump in a violating norms and politics\nAnd a word almost extra constitutional so I think the prompt\nManaged to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would he managed to get the Democrats to drop their own to rock to re surprise on their feet and having to blow up in their face\nAnd yeah it's it does it does seem like that and I know there are a bunch of people like Dean Heller or who is long considered our most endangered a senator senator from Nevada\nHe strongly supported Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and that appears to have given him a boost I think they're running tied now right now in that aren't they\n[noise] I think of the election were held today Republicans would lose none of their seats and the only question is what the Democrats lose two three or four years\nWow which means that of course Republican control of the Senate what about on the house side\n[noise] I Would say the Democrats because of a variety of good factories including the fact that uh you know suburban women become one of the most resistant groups against Trump twenty five point gender gap against them\nOr against Republicans I think there are sixty percent chance to take back the house but sixty percent of a lot lower than it was two or three weeks ago because I think that\nAs the issues start to be talked about you to remember most\nOf your listeners are into politics Michael you and I are into politics the average voter doesn't pay attention to much closer to the election\nSo when they actually look at the issues is a center right country and if the Republicans frame the issues property they tend to close the gap in the last two weeks unless there's some extraneous event like the two thousand they try natural melt them\nOkay two two issues which are very much front and center at this moment uh one is the alleged had horrible gas that President Trump made last night and used and when he calls himself a nationalist to do things is going to alienate millions and millions of American voters\n[noise] I think it may be the hundreds and hundreds of reporters and journalist who are once again I'm appalled by the fact that the president is you know troll\n... totally ...

wrong to say when I was a kid it was okay I don't know where she Megan's not that old and a black face haven't been okay for a long time\nI really and people know that it was a stupid thing to say

that particular harm to um to more controversy\nAnd uh and and there's this um [noise]\nThere's a great deal of controversy about Stacey Abrams who is a candidate for governor she's the Democratic nominee\nFor governor in Georgia and she's running as Brian Kemp who is the Republicans the states ... states Stacey Evans is state senator\nAnd a ...\n... years of problems a two fold problem one of the items that seems to me is more of a problem than the other\nUh the one that's getting all the attention today is a CNN is reporting democratic candidate to be George next governor explained her presence Tuesday at a Nineteen Ninety to protest that included burning the state flag\nShe said that was part of her opposition to Confederate symbolism\nHer a involvement came to light on social media and the statement to CNN Abrams campaign said that the actions in college were part of a permitted peaceful protest against the Confederate emblem in the flag it's part of Georgia State flag\nAt the time of the protest in Nineteen Ninety to the states ... states flag contained the Confederate battle flag emblem which had been a prominent feature say flags since it was adopted Nineteen fifty six when the battle over to the segregation was raging in the south\nOr the Confederate battle flag emblem wasn't fully recover removed from the states flag until two thousand three\nAnd then uh the statement from the uh Stacey Abrams campaign says during Stacey Abrams college years Georgia was at a crossroads struggling\nAnd how to overcome racially divisive issues including symbols of the confederacy the sharpest of which was the inclusion of the Confederate emblem and the Georgia State flag\nThen it uh goes on to say a first time in public services deputy city attorney in a state legislative leader of all been focused on bringing people together to solve problems\nOf educate the fact that back in Nineteen\nNinety two she participated in a demonstration against the state flag that's not a problem it seems to me and shouldn't be a big problem in our campaign it's a long time ago and the flag was changed anyway she's not burning contemporary Georgia flag I'll tell you what is a problem\nShe has gone on record\nAnd she is standing by at about basically blowing up the largest Confederate monument to the mall and this is one that I've spoken about this before on this whole issue of Confederate monuments\nI I Can't understand why you would decide not to blow anything up but to move a statue for instance the best example is a New Orleans\nThey had a statue of Robert easily on top of a killer and it really looked over the whole city and it was sort of like the Nelson's statue on top of a pillar infer fog or square in Great Britain in London\nAnd having Robert de Leon such a prominent place looking over the whole city I get a problem\nDon't blow it up but they and I don't know what they're putting on top of that pillar of anything made it to evolve pillar down they move all the statue okay\nBut when you're talking about Stone Mountain I actually looked it up the Stone Mountain memorials bigger than Mount Rushmore and its carved into the side of a mountain and it took about Thirty years to do all the carving it was a very very big undertaking and in the side of the mountain is an image of Jefferson\nDavis president the confederacy Robert de league commander of the army of northern Virginia\nAnd his chief lieutenant Thomas Jonathan Jackson Stonewall Jackson and they're all riding along and Stacey Abrams is taken the position that event monument has to be removed and trashed and honestly I don't understand it\nThere are lots of African Americans in the state of Georgia Stone Mountain by the way it's over three thousand acres of beautiful beautiful park\nAnd it is owned I'm pretty sure by the city of Atlanta is three thousand acres and their trails they used to have a whole neo Confederate theme park is the New York times points out where they had a plantation house that's all gone\nIf they put up appropriate signage that looks at the side of this mountain as a historical symbol wouldn't that be a better way to go than simply sand blasting it or ruining it are knocking it down and because of the size of Stone Mountain\nYou're putting the minds of the Taliban remember them they blew up these Buddhas because they took over the Buddhist were over twelve hundred years old\nAnd they blew them up in the ... valley and uh basically that was a that was before September eleventh and I went on the air and I talked about it and I said this is an act of terrorism\nAgainst the past and look I understand that you can move a statue\nBut the notion that you have to blow up a whole mountainside\nIt's it's a little bit nutty in uh the New York times they point out that the\nDavid Huckabee who is a Georgia syndicated columnist no relation to the White House press secretary\nAssailed misery roast position\nRating that she intends to run the most racist and divisive campaign history of Georgia politics\nRemoving such symbols won't keep one black father at home with his family is won't take a single illegal weapon off of a single street in a single black\nNeighborhood and a ... ... ... look I I understand\nThat the whole history behind the Stone Mountain monument\nIs a a a it is a terrible thing because they started putting it up started plans for Nineteen fourteen\nAnd it was associated with the rise of the clan all of which of course was presided over with great approval by a southerner Democratic president\nWoodrow Wilson and yes Woodrow Wilson was a ... Virginia\nI Know he was governor of New Jersey before\nBut uh [noise] the idea that you have to blow up that memorial ... why would Democrats want to be the real Taliban of American politics I don't get it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number we'll be right back\nWith a at a time when white supremacy and neo Confederate apologetic were held to be the case but we're very different place in our country right now\nBut to literally blast away this three acres the image of Jackson Lee Ann Davis covers three acres on the face of this mountain\nAnd the idea of just blasting it up it it seems to me that a number there are a number of black leaders in Atlanta\nWho do believe that that is a Neal asleep polarizing and pointless to insist on blowing up a a beautiful city park let's go to John in Kansas City John you're on the Michael ... show hey\nYou know my heart on well you're very good record you made it and I can listen to your ... and above is again okay maybe and build their heritage\nNo no I've never I never say that this is their heritage I never say that they have because the heritage of treason should be rejected\nAll right okay okay well you hear me out fish you find it so beautiful historical and all that how would you feel that there was a Stone Mountain of Adolf Eichmann I'm Rick killer and all that they don't they lost the war to they were fighting for their country that's their heritage\nBut again and again I I I Would I Do not use the argument of heritage and that's not the point the point is if there was if there is an art work a piece of art is carved into a mountain that can't be moved because you cannot move age three acres culture that it took Thirty years to make you only\nBlow it up or if there's something like that it's different from moving a statue and again I Do not believe that they're at I think it's important to preserve for instance I don't think that outfits should be blown up\nI think it's important that it be preserved date is part of the record of history and they didn't have any statues and our ships but if they have them there that should be preserved as part of the historical record as well\nAnd given the fact that ah they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house\nAt a Stone Mountain I think they still have a place I was there recently they still have a place called Confederate house but Confederate house doesn't have anything inside it any more they just have T shirts they Stone Mountain\nAnd or should it have anything inside of a ... some people get Confederate souvenirs no of course not because you're right this is a dark chapter of American history it's not one to be celebrated\nBut that doesn't mean it seems to me following the Taliban example of blowing up monuments from a different era we will be right back on the ... that show [noise]\n\nNews dorm nine Ninety\n[noise] with us our news on the feeders in Washington President Trump\nIs criticizing the Saudi operation that killed journalists demolish Augie calling at one of the worst cover ups in the history of cover ups Mr Trump tells reporters in the oval office that he's expecting a full report on the killings soon but he says quote they had a very bad original concept and it was carried out poorly\nCalled the events Africa showed is that the worst cover up ever\nSandra Day O'Connor the first woman on the Supreme Court so she has the beginning stages of dementia and probably all climbers disease O'Connor made the announcement on a letter on Tuesday she said her diagnosis was made some time ago and that as a condition of progress she has no longer able to participate in public life\nO'Connor eighty eight was nominated by President Reagan and took her seat on the court in Nineteen eighty one\nOn Wall street that out on by a hundred and forty six points that as that property won the U.S in the lower by fifty this is that's already knew\n[noise] news\nTalk nine anytime they were trafficked sponsored by then get up we are\nDealing with some issues right now heading along the south side of the northeast extension serious accident\n...
