else I appear besides filling in for Larry Tanner fact I'll be filling in for Dennis Prager on Monday and it's our I'd be remiss if I didn't start out talking about the recent spate of bombs or at least the would be bombs I guess and the arrest of a suspect\nI didn't even want to say his name because often these people like the fame or infamy for that matter that they acquire by these dastardly acts\nThe suspect but we did have previous arrests and was known to the authorities but we can't prevent every crime or a threat in this country I'm Amazed that we prevent as many as we do and and you know figure out who's up to what but one has to be impressed with the quick action of the authorities to find the suspect\nIt never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are they are truly amazing and and in fact uh one of the things I set for all the years that\nYou know the top press is not that effective bought the day in and day out people who do the job are terrific\nAnd it was good to see by the way the FBI Director make a statement about the effectiveness of his team and others who helped out actually I don't know what I felt the FBI Director disappeared and he was on the FBI's ten most wanted list you know never hear from him in his like he doesn't exist\nI've not been happy with his lack of enthusiasm and taking actions against those who knows department who abuse their authority and they clearly did and speaking of unhappy with leadership I see where attorney general sessions if you're watching today he made a statement showing some leadership and one of his last\nMy opinion likely high profile lax\nBefore his dismissed I I think the only reason he's not being dismissed by the president is goes all the issues and people in the mall or investigation and everything else that's going on and\nHis next attorney general wouldn't be approved right now with you know what do you want another uh Kavanaugh hearing to take place this is not the time but he's never lived up to the expectations I have for him\nAnd I think many others did too I mean I remember he was the first one that came out for President Trump's ... a month a first senator who did so and he took some of what a risk so you think he's got courage he's a risk taking nah\nIt's such a nice asleep at the wheel sometimes to\nActually now that I think of it he an FBI Director a never seem to have the passion and energy that I think is necessary and their job\nAnd speaking of being surprised I was impressed with the postal employees who helped in this effort you know catch capture the suspect\nI never thought they were being sold main Sean I never thought they could move that fast and let me ... I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I Know I was just thinking about that well you every you know there was an older it was the veil and if people remember Steve Allen did the Tonight Show and he wrote this book called I think it was dumb ass\nAnd he said he pulled up to the post office they have one heavy box he's having a lot of trouble lifting the box he finally gets to the counter at the post office and the clerk and Steve Allen is the only one there he was before Johnny Carson and the car says where's your number\nAnd Steve Allen says I don't have a number he says well you'll have to go back and could not much we can freeze the box always a back pose that weren't you know those numbers like you might get at a bakery or at a deli counter something\nGrabs the ticket comes back with the heavy boxes walks up to the counter he's the only one there and the postal clerk says Thirteen ... says number but that's the postal service right that's always been the reputation hey but you got to give them credit seems those who investigated these kinds of things that an excellent job [noise]\nUm but seriously it never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are well I don't you know President Trump says we have the best ...\nI think in in this case you know what I'm Around the world when there's investigations of plane crashes or any issue like that but you know last plane lost ships whatever they always call the United states we have tremendous law enforcement people\nWhich by the way it's on the side was why are so disappointing to see the upper echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department\nEngaging the soft coup I think a lot of people now that now against the legitimately elected president of the United states Donald Trump\nButter unhappiness with these top officials as I said was never meant to reflect on the regular Asians those who do the work day in and day out and the FBI and other agencies\nWhich as I said that's why so disgraceful to see those in power tarnished the image of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and then you have the Democrats saying\nAll the Republicans don't support the FBI no we do support the FBI we don't support it becoming you know as soon as being so tarnished and so ruined because somebody you engaged in an old like a banana republic activities that's why we're unhappy with the top people or the Justice Department people like Clapper Brennan and the rest of them\nSo whether the suspect winds up being someone with the mental issues\nOr someone who is just the evil the fact remains that in this country you do not get back at your political enemies by threatening them with harm or worse you just don't do that\nNeedless to say these type of acts can do irreparable damage to our political system\nAnd the you know you don't you know on the line I think of what the uh the Hillary Clinton people in the left and those who are out to get the president is what they were doing that's why we're so disaster someone should be pointed that out\nWhen he tried to do the political system is what you guys already with the political system in trying to get a legitimately elected as a president or impeached\nNo one can defend this behavior and everyone should condemn it\nThis is pure evil no matter which side of the political spectrum the perpetrator is on and it looks like we all know sure looks like what did he have a stickers on his van and actually it looks like one of those crazy is that you want to be around no matter what side but it certainly\nWe all get deeply frustrated and disappointed when people we disagree with control our destiny\nIt always amazes me that those and the resistance against President Trump have no clue nor did they probably care that we were is unhappy with this election and the re election of President Obama to the presidency as they were with President Trump's victory\nThat would never dawned on them never never never dawned on them after all\nMany of us thought Iraq Obama was the worst president in our lifetime if not in our history so what are the announcer was five days I think it was five days before the election that he wanted to fundamentally change the United states of America\nWe are far away\nThe amount of like you're not as [noise]\nI always got that wrong I always thought it was seven days that he really gave notice you quickly for job you do give two weeks notice ... days before what previous presidents I Want to ask you had said anything even close to that\nAnd which president went on an apology tour soon after being reelected\nHistory has made when a leader steps up stays true to his values charts a fundamentally different course for the country\nThat's 'cause you're not in power when you get 'em ... I Wonder if you agree that we should try a fundamentally different course when we get in power that he was talking about Obama I didn't even know that well he should have was right yeah [noise]\nAnd apologized for what you may know my sign up is always a pleasure privilege to have like front of the greatest history a country in the history of the world\nBut we're on our side never engaged in a resistance as such we never engaged in a soft coup we never threatened to bomb the White House in those actresses or singers threatened that like that in March that day of or the day after whatever it was\nOr printed you see this in the New York times uh about the assassination of the current president I guess it's supposed to be fiction obviously but ah we don't do that kind of stuff\nBut the left and the Democrats and the press what'd you really the same thing has never accepted as a victory and will do anything to remove him from office that seems clear including blaming his rhetoric for the suspects violence which is where I'm going to go now\nEven before anything they knew you know they didn't know much about the suspect\nSo this will be used and it's being used to hurt President Trump and the Republicans especially with the November elections just stays away [noise] so this guy did it because of what President Trump says that's what they'll have you believe [noise]\nAnd because of everything goes wrong is President Trump's fault mark I live in a pain free studio side comes studios don't you think ... I mean I think eight eight eight nine seven one say\nHi Mark a the mark or what you were a bringing up about a media is absolutely true\nThey don't want to report the fact that the a cycle and he is a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida light power and I I don't know some other bomb threats to sow what Trump responsible for though no\nHe happens to be just you know the ... the ... ... now and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up reading the words you said a few times during his is a a a\nNod to his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times he said oh yeah go ahead on or something like that that would that but\nHe hasn't done anything like that where the the the lab whether it's the actual a political people or the the new uh they've all actually said that\nAre going out and confront them and and and and and run 'em out of the stores all this other stuff so I'm again that that part of the contracts and different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know during the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that [laughter]\nOh of course it's the the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that accept them well do they recognize it but they're not going to say it and even most of the hard core\nI Would say you know a intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something there that way if the Trump arrangements that now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah

Obama twice well uh\nI'm Sorry I did that but I Love President Trump\nA I changed from Democrat to Republican\nI've heard that a lot of people have done that and we need I I Know President Trump was going to win because I Believe that God has his hand on that man\nHe has a strong man he is a an intelligent man he knows what to do he wants to do the right thing and they love this country and

got a problem with the press we had a problem with the media it's been so obvious to so many years\nAnd as I said this is the first president to call them on it and they can't take it\nThey can accept that how dare you challenge them and one can't just ignore this because when the left and the Democrats and\nEven some liberals when they're not on us to there is a former cause\nThey can't accept us fighting back there all the same\nThey're all the same and this and they've always had a meeting on their side and you also Mason it's amazing we went in the elections because when you have the media against you and you have the school's against you and I actually slows it only Marcus they're here I I teach part time too I can tell you the schools are against us\nAnd they document students and I said for years it's not a wonder that any students come out as liberal or on the left side but wonder is that any of them come out as conservatives because they've been and doctrine and you've got the media how do we ever we that's the question when\nDonald Trump won and I was teaching and I told the story of the other day when I was on the it was so funny because I I was texting back and forth to find out the news results and it was the first day of a new semester and the students complain to the assistant principal that I was texting too much and she called me into our office and she said\nMark don't worry I defended you 'cause we're so all of a subset about how the results came out it never dawned on her that I like being on the other side and she defended me because\nThey just always assume where you must be on the political spectrum\nSure into our show but I appreciate that very much yeah do\nI did get to talk to are like ... and I had experience with like you might be

she wasn't a Democrat but I Can't vote for Democrats doesn't work it they'll have a habit all she actually told me that the Trump very very lucky to have a supporter lightning\nBut my point is that

A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com and a lot of you've done that\nAnd you'll find out on my website and all these other sites where I Will be appearing next besides going in for learning or dentists or whatever I Do other stuff to\nLast hour talked about the effort of the left to blame these would be bombings on President Trump because the left and the media and the Democrats hate him\nIn this segment I Want to talk about what a great job in the ... a color at the end of the other our asked me to do that what has he done that's so good I think he didn't think there was anything but I Want to talk about what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office\nI said for months now that I care less about what he says and much more in what he does\nHis tweets have not always helped him and he's in my opinion is after many people you shouldn't and engaged with people beneath his position to his detriment I I play tennis a lot\nAnd uh when uh sometimes on the court people kind of know who I Am and they try to get my vote I just don't answer them off and I am I getting paid for this getting paid I'm not answering your guts but he talked and you know get some debates with people who shouldn't\nBut I never expected him to govern in such a conservative way he's far surpass my expectations for him I must admit he was not my first choice in the primary season\nI was actually a Ted Cruz delicate in my initial judgment I thought Trump was only better than John Case like which has been saying much because ... will be a Democrat\nBut I have long since submitted that far from being the worst choice or the second worst choice for president he may have very well being the only Republican that could have one in fact I've wondered out loud and the caller suggested this last hour if processor Providence was involved in this election\nAfter all a bomb had done you know talking about radically changing our country it might have very well been too late to turn America back of Hillary had one and I don't know if you know Bruce ... he ran against Barbara Boxer the but when she ran for US Senate\nAnd I asked him if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country and the answer of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost every single right and wasn't also Providence I Wonder that we got George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most\nYou get no argument from me about gods involvement and now I think we got Donald J Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most yesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election of course that doesn't matter much either considering we try to against and remember many\nSo it would be very satisfy we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges especially for the Supreme Court so I thought were way ahead of the game when he points to Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court but he didn't stop there let me go through the list that\nCaller wanted ending the Obamacare mandate opening up the Keystone Pipeline than Anwar reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy\nA significant tax cut I don't know why he talks about it but not enough Republicans do lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms moving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords withdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal\nMeeting with Kim all young to possibly produce the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\nGetting American remains he's already done that returned from North Korea [noise]\nMaking sure our borders means something yeah color from last hour who knows what people are up to there just isn't it a coincidence that the coming right around the election and the ... who knows how they're getting paid how they're supporting themselves yeah I've heard local church groups and so on\nBut this isn't just organized spontaneously\nAnd of course naming now for a second Supreme Court a choice a few weeks ago and he was successful another I'm Brett Kavanaugh Phyllis goes on and on and the American people love that he is not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who\nSpain and Spain and spin that's where we are talking about last hour and are afraid to say what they are really thinking you don't have\nThat problem you can never say that about President Trump he may say too much but he never has two little he is one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime\nHe has done a great job and most of the American people get but it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or that comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left this the Democrats and liberal listeners so maybe it was for this if the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected he's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nYou are dreaming if you think he's going to be defeated you a failed to get rid of him but not for lack of trying you started the day he won\nActual we now know that they start their resistance again ... against the much before election day but was election day came they couldn't believe that this so called bumbling fools had won\nSo bumbling but he still one no matter what the upper lead of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed he won\nAnd I almost I mentioned this last hour in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania\nWhich always seemed like a Republicans fool's gold down we're always going to win a Romney who's gonna win ... W is going to win it but not only did he win but they are despite their best efforts he want he still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the color persecution\nOr is that prosecution got to think about that we were the which one is that no matter the hostile media no matter the never Trump hers no matter all the elites and the swamp President Trump is still here which never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor pointed\nAnd including the best efforts in terms of the bomber it won't work even though they won accused him of being responsible for the bomber he's accused of everything and anything they can come up with he still hear\nIt never should have happened with the ... investigation of Moffat Jeff Sessions as an aside I'm disappointed he never recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nBut typically politicians talk to our adversaries did she talk the Russians remember the reset button remember Obama saying after he was reelected that he would take care of it and you know they work work it out and he promised that off Mike\nSo all of this you know I'm disappointed in sessions disappointing his lack of oversight should fire Rosenstein but the fact is President Trump has defeated all of this and as we said last hour\nThe press can handle it they can accept that this guy talks back then he says well we've been thinking all these years\nThat's why people are so thrilled with him finally we got someone in the Republican Party that had some courage it's about time that someone standing up for what\nWe believe in let me know what you think eight eight eight nine seven once age eight eight eight seven to nine to one Seventy four three

worse than the rent so I'm\nIn a nutshell because we don't have a lot of time to react to my theory or my belief that Iran is much worse than Saudi Arabia because he ran is a far greater danger\nTo the west and to Israel and Saudi Arabia is which is a danger more to itself although I fully acknowledged the Saudi contribution to a fundamental was awful madrassas around the world so on what grounds do you think otherwise\nThe group that did nine eleven was from Saudi Arabia the um\nThe money they want to I Want to come from Saudi Arabia to\nYeah okay I don't know I don't know what rumors

in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the mark iceberg show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter\nOr leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to on the show\nAs always you know miles email there Marcus ... dot com sorry about that which many of you've done over the years you email me and I appreciate that very much\nAnd if you check my website and those other sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Larry Tanner fact I'll be filling in for Dennis Prager on Monday and this hour I'd be remiss if I didn't start out talking about the recent spate of bombs or at least the would be bombs I guess and the arrest of a suspect [noise]\nI I don't even want to say his name because often these people like the fame or infamy for that matter that they acquire by these dastardly acts\nThe suspect but we did have previous arrests and was known to the authorities but we can't prevent every crime or a threat in this country I'm Amazed that we prevent as many as we do and and you know figure out who's up to what\nBut one has to be impressed with the quick action of the authorities to find the suspect\nIt never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are they are truly amazing\nAnd and in fact uh one of the things I set for all the years that you know the top press is not that effective bought the day in and day out people who do the job are terrific\nAnd it was good to see by the way the FBI Director make a statement about the effectiveness of his team and others who helped out actually I don't mean you but I felt the FBI Director disappeared and he was on the FBI's ten most wanted list you know never hear from him into office like he doesn't exist\nI've not been happy with his lack of enthusiasm and taking actions against those hundreds department who abuse their authority and they clearly did\nAnd speaking of unhappy with leadership I see where attorney general sessions if you're watching today he made a statement showing some leadership and one of his last\nMy opinion is likely high profile lax\nBefore is dismissed I I think the only reason he's not being dismissed by the president is goes all the issues and people you know with the Mueller investigation and everything else that's going on and\nHis next attorney general wouldn't be approved right now with you know what do you want another\nUh Kavanaugh hearing to take place this is not the time but he's never lived up to the expectations I have for him\nAnd I think many others did too and I remember he was the first one that came out for President Trump's ... a month of first senator who did so and he took some of what a risk so you think he's got courage he's a risk taker nah\nIt's such a nice asleep at the wheel sometimes to\nActually now that I think of it he an FBI Director re never seemed to have the passion and energy that I think is necessary in their job and speaking of being surprised I was impressed with the postal employees who helped in this effort you know catch capture the suspect [noise]\nI never thought they were being sold main Sean I never thought they could move that fast in any capacity I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I Know I was just thinking about that well you ever you know there was an older though Steve Allen of people remember Steve Allen did the Tonight Show and he wrote this book call I think it was dumb\nAnd he said he pulled up to the post office had one heavy box he's having a lot of trouble lifting the box he finally gets to the counter at the post office and the clerk and Steve Allen's the only one there he was before Johnny Carson and the car says where's your number\nAnd Steve Allen says I don't have a number he says well you'll have to go back to not much we can freeze the box always back\nPlus I Want you know those numbers like you might get it a bakery or at a deli counter something\nGrabs the ticket comes back with a heavy box walks up to the counter he's the only one there and the postal clerk says Thirteen call this number but that's the postal service right that's always been the reputation hey but you've got to give them credit seems those who investigated these kinds of things that an excellent job\nOf but seriously it never ceases to amaze me have professional an excellent our law enforcement people are well\nI don't you know President Trump says we have the best and the ... I think in in this case you notice around the world when there's investigations of plane crashes or any issue like that but you know last plane lost ships whatever they always call the United states we have tremendous law enforcement people\nWhich by the way it's on the side was why it was so disappointing to see the upper echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department engage in a soft coup I think a lot of people's knowledge that now against the legitimately elected president of United States Donald Trump\nButter unhappiness with these top officials as I said was never meant to reflect on the regular agents those who do the work day in and day out and the FBI and other agencies\nWhich as I said that's why so disgraceful to see those in power tarnish the image of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and then you have the Democrats saying\nAll the Republicans don't support the FBI no we do support the FBI we don't support it becoming you know as soon as you being so tarnished and so ruined because somebody you engaged in a lot of hold like a banana republic activities that's why we're unhappy with the top people or the Justice Department people like Clapper Brennan and the rest of them\nSo whether the suspect winds up being someone with the mental issues\nOr someone who's just evil\nThe fact remains that in this country you do not get back at your political enemies by threatening them with harm or worse you just don't do that\nNeedless to say these type of acts\nDo irreparable damage to our political system\nAnd the you know you don't you know on the line I think of what the uh the Hillary Clinton people in the left and those who are out to get the president is what they were doing that's why we're so disastrous someone should be pointed that out\nWhen he tried to do the political system is what you guys already with the political system and trying to get a legitimately elected president uh impeached\nNo one can defend this behavior and everyone should condemn this is pure evil no matter which side of the political spectrum the perpetrator is on and it looks like we do loans sure looked like what did he have a stickers on his van and actually it looks like one of those crazy is that you want to be around no matter what side but it certainly\nWe all get deeply frustrated and disappointed when people we disagree with control our destiny\nIt always amazes me that those in the resistance against President Trump have no clue nor did they probably care that we were as unhappy with this election and the reelection a President Obama to the presidency as they were with President Trump's victory\nThat would never dawned on them never never never dawned on them\nAfter all many of us thought Iraq Obama was the worst president in our lifetime if not in our history so what are the announcer was five days I think it was five days before the election that he wanted to fundamentally changed the United states of America\nSo we are far away\nThe amount of like a lot of [noise]\nI always got that wrong I always thought it was seven days that he really gave notice you push for jobs you to give to let us know now says that fuck days before at\nWhat previous presidents I Want to ask you had said anything even close to that and which president went on an apology tour soon after being reelected\nHistory has made one a leader steps up stays true to his values in charge so fundamentally different course for the country\nThat's 'cause you're not in power when you get in power I Wonder if you agree that we should ... different course when we get in power that he was talking about Obama I didn't even know that well he should have was right yeah [noise]\nAnd apologize for what you may know my sign up is always a pleasure privileged to have a my front of the greatest history of the country in the history of the world\nBut we're on our side never engaged in a resistance as such we never engaged in a soft coup we never threatened to bomb the White House didn't wear those actresses or singers threatened that like that march that day of or the day after whatever it was\nOr printed you see this in the New York times uh about the assassination of the current president I guess it's supposed to be fiction obviously but ah we don't do that kind of stuff but the left and the Democrats and the press would you really the same thing\nHas never accepted as a victory and will do anything to remove him from office that seems clear including blaming his rhetoric for the suspects violence which is where I'm going to go now even before anything they knew you know they didn't know much about the suspect so this will be used and it's being used to hurt President Trump\nAnd the Republicans especially with the November elections just stays away [noise] so this guy did it because of what President Trump says that's what they'll have you believe [noise]\nAnd because of everything goes wrong is President Trump's fault Tom mark I live in a pain free studios dot com studios let me know what you think ... dot com [noise] let me not to think eight eight eight nine seven want to say\n[laughter] I\nHi Mark a the mark or what you were bringing up about a media is absolutely true\nThey don't want to record the fact that the a psycho and he is a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida light power and I I don't know some other bomb threats to sow what Trump responsible for though no\nHe happens to be just you know the the ... the bill ... now and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up or the worst you said a few times during his is a a a\nNot his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times they said oh yeah go ahead on the face or something like that that would that but he hasn't done anything like that where the the left whether it's the actual lyrical up people or the the new\nUh they've all actually said that are going out and confront them and and and and and run them out of the stores all this other stuff so I'm again that that part of the contrast in different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know they're in the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that oh of\nCourse it's the the the ultimate double standard that uh everyone recognizes that accept them well do they recognize it but they're not going to say it and even most of the hard core\nWould say you know a intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are\nActually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something there that way if the Trump arrangements that I'm now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it ... you know that's what they would say no question about it

fantastic and as far as the the the\n... which tell me what that might have things you do any of the week there's been ready to DC more politically correct attention you're dismayed learn something said Larry Elder [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nPain free really ... dot com studios\n[laughter]\nFilling in for Dennis on Monday if he hears me say this I'm In trouble right\nBack with you again filling in for Larry I've done a lot of this over the years including at our former station and it's always a privilege to keep it\nTo me and see where I Am on the air next to my Web page or what I like to some music you know he was he say I'm from Brooklyn now in LA and one of the songs I Love that\nBecause it defines me\nCheck my Web page out mark hosts the show dot com where you can email

and see where a filling besides for learning or Dennis like that so the Dodgers and playing him tonight right and I and I always root against the Dodgers why do I do that\nOf a regionally from Brooklyn and they left me and when people here that they go\nWith you left Brooklyn too\nI was a little kid what they did do that to us [noise] All right we're taking your calls at\nEight eight nine seven once agents for those are just joining us the first hour and we were talking about the bombs and the uh the accused and we didn't mention his name that's important so they don't get that kind of publicity if that's what they're seeking\nBut after we did that and said that how outrageous it was an we acknowledge that\nWe got into the idea that the press obviously wants to blame President Trump for everything and anything everything is his fault that goes wrong and everything that goes right President Obama as you heard we'd like to take credit we we played a clip of him a minute or two of them in the last hour and it was hard for me to take\nBecause I forgot what he did all the time which is he would set up strong dummies and then tear it down like you said in the clip we have that to you know we want to risk babies a wave of that from the arms of immigrants no they're illegal immigrants and we don't want to rip babies away was your policy by the way Mr former president\nYou know we didn't change that policy needs to be changed obviously but it was your policy in the first place\nAnd we don't want to rip babies away in fact the real answer is\nDon't come here in the first place if you're going to come illegally come here legally and there'll be no issue and who knows who setting up this caravan who's paying for all of it how they're getting here I've heard all kinds of rumors but the fact is\nHe's got to stop them it's an invasion you can't allow this to happen there'll be followed by others but again he can't do anything right and of course the things he says\nAre the reasons that the suspect in custody did what he did it's because of President Trump\nBut then we evolved into the point\nThat you know why they hate him so much among other reasons because he's the first Republican that I can remember in years who's standing up to their nonsense who's willing to call it like it is it's reasonable to ask as I mentioned the last hour whether Hillary should be indicted for what she did she committed crimes\nAnd when I was sympathetic to her eye on another station another network people get annoyed with me because I said if they agreed to leave the scene forever maybe we could agree not to indict Hillary and people said she's not above the law that is a reasonable argument that's what they said lock her up\nThat is not violent does just following the rules and principles that we all in this country are subject to the laws of the country what is so radical about that\nYet but but yet when President Trump says it it's absolutely outrageous\nAnd what else I Can't even remember what else they pick on him for what was the other issues besides lock her up that they say Trump keeps inciting the audience when I think of it I'll let you know but whatever he says it's ... it's just terrible right on the press because the press the fake press they have a fake press\nBut yeah I mean the people the enemy the people they're not going to do objective journalism 'cause they have tremendous power\nAnd you know if they can if you ... ... people can't get the news and an object away I never knew when I was growing up what the politics was\nOf the journalists who are reporting it that's not true now\nTheir gender so clear he's right to call them out on it\nI think this is insanity when when the Obama could be outraged sent in theory the rest of us and say things like you'll keep your doctor and you keep your health care and uh you know we're we're ... we we care about race people on our side and we judge people by the color of their skin numbered don't illegals all\nI've often said give me nine black women on the Supreme Court core conservative and I'm happy camper know where the guys that I always see race\nAnd gender and uh you know sexual orientation we don't talk that way we see individuals much more than a dentist and Larry always talk about we see people as people you're the guys that do this kind of stuff\nAll right let me know what you think and we'll take your calls at eight eight nine seven one stage and I hear I have an article Sean just gave me journalists accuse Trump of inciting violence against the press I mean I I I don't even want to read the article now 'cause it's too upsetting you guys have created this in the media because you haven't been fair\nLet me know what you think well let's go to um I think we're going to Angus is is that Angus I don't see the name of al ... there's a town called I stuck to Syria though how You're welcome to the uh welcome to the ... to show\nHow are you there okay we'll put out on hold and\n\nOkay and let's go to George in Hollywood, California Georgia Iran was mark [noise]\nYeah [noise] Well Mark you know as a retired a [noise] a mental health professional I just have to say that the uh one time media has finally revealed itself in its severe side cos\nAnd I'm at this point uh the media end of this a bomber individual both have some very prominent features a paranoid schizophrenia\nAnd I'd start with these uh\nA media a nuts are saying oh that Trump is responsible for all of this uh bombers stopping these responsible for the bomb well you know\nThat's not only mind reading but it's thought insertion they believe that Trump has inserted thoughts into the bombers mind for him to go do it\nAnd the bomber of course well uh you know it's fought broadcasting and he's having a conversation with Trump through with television or maybe he looks out a picture of him in the paper and he says oh we're so I get the water or tell me what hardware store do I get the pipe bad or what about this other stuff\nWell the reality is is that individuals are responsible for their own behavior and speech just moves air and\nPeople their motivations belong to them\nAnd what they do is their responsibility\nAnd speeches protected for the president just as it is for everybody else\nAnd just like we've been talking we didn't blame a Bernie Sanders for what that guy uh with that a phony a you know Chinese a cave rifle did in nearly killing Steve\nA school lease and um [noise] uh the other people that were out there with the baseball but the thing of it is is that um you know moving air with speech\nIs one thing but behavior moved physical objects and those things can either be helpful like somebody building a building\nOr making sandwiches are cooking a meal for someone can be harmful\nCatch you let me know what you think eight eight eight nine seven one sage I Want to talk about the article journalists accused Trump of inciting violence against the press one else is new [noise] all\nThe bond is currently sat at five million dollars [noise]\nWe have just as as a few hours ago determined in in a a sample is some of the suspects movements in actions just prior to the shooting\nThe we received a tip that the suspect was seen outside of the local church where a he appeared to on video has been attempting to gain access into the church uh their video surveillance system called that\nHe was unsuccessful in gaining access to the church\n[noise] well that that's a very sad story and uh we'll ... we'll follow it a little bit more of a just a curve or shooting suspect tried to enter a black churches before killing to look they're crazies out there there is there ... none of us are denying that\nWhat we have a problem with his whole group of people are accused of that like you know Republicans are evil and ... and ... that's the problem we there we know there are nuts like the the guys up the pipe bombs we understand that but we all don't get guilty of that\nBecause of it we we don't take responsibility for the\nPerson who Trump hasn't done anything outraged look he's not a perfect package\nHe doesn't always say what I wanted to say but he's standing up to the other side which hasn't happened before and that's why you have the reporters are filling out that the a document with two hundred people signed onto they can't take it because they're holier than thou and by the way through on the left they're always on the left\nBreaking ATF news just recently the U.S department of education announced that acting on a complaint filed by alliance defending freedom\nAgainst the Decatur, Georgia city schools is opening an investigation into a horrible assault of a kindergarten her

a title\nThe number one trending story you guy that's what's going on and in fact that's what I Want to take your calls about you can talk about anything related to what I'm saying but I I I think we've got a problem with the press we had a problem with the media it it's been so obvious to so many years and as I said this is the first president\nTo call them on it and they can't take it they can accept that how dare you\nChallenge them and one can't just ignore this because when the left and the Democrats and\nEven some liberals when they're not honest to there is a former cause\nIs they can't accept us fighting back there all the same\nThey're all the same in this sense they've always had the media on their side and it was amazing it's amazing we went in the elections because when you have the media against you and you have the school's against you and if you don't know me from our guys are here I I teach part time too I can tell you the schools are against us\nAnd they document the students and I said for years it's not a wonder that any students come out as liberal or on the left side but wonder is that any of them come out as conservatives because they've been and doctrine and you've got the media how do we ever we\nThat's the question when Donald Trump won and I was teaching and I told the story of the other day when I was on\nThe it was so funny because I I was texting back and forth to find out the news results and it was the first day of a new semester and the students complained to the assistant principal that I was texting too much and she called me into her office and she said\nMark don't worry I defended you 'cause we're so all of a subset about how the results came out it never dawned on her that I like being on the other side and she defended me because\nThey just always assume where you must be on the political spectrum\nSure until our show but I appreciate that very much yeah do\nI did get to talk to a like Gallagher is boring and I had

my job at all and we all know\nAnd they sit down and eat and I I get the look it up and my wife like why don't you go out and you can take a picture with on a show or by on your face all your friends that everybody can get along and I was like that's a good idea thought I was asked them\nI didn't know what was going to happen but the lady actually ended up being a candidate who's running for state representative and Indiana\nAnd uh she was very gracious and very polite\nAnd we have a Fifteen twenty minutes talk we got along real well with real life through showed a kind of ended where I told her that she's a very nice person I Wish she wasn't a Democrat but I Can't vote for Democrats doesn't work it they'll have a pet but all she actually told me that that does a Trump very very lucky that was the border like me\nBut my point is that there is good people on both sides but even with all the hate going on\nWe just got to start looking for it again I it it it there and that's all I wanted to say well thanks for having me on a show I Love talking to you thank you bye yeah\nBut you call to different shows you know what to do that so [laughter] I'm just two shows some of the stuff

talk about what a great job in the ... a ... at the end of the other our asked me to do that what is it done that's so good I think he didn't think there was anything but I Want to talk about what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office\nI sit for months now that I care less about what he says and much more in what he does\nHis tweets have not always helped him and he's in my opinion is after many people who shouldn't and engaged with people beneath his position to his detriment I I play tennis a lot\nAnd uh when uh sometimes on the court people kind of know who I Am and they try to get my vote I just don't answer them off and I say am I getting paid for this getting paid I'm not answering your guts\nBut he talked and you know get some debates with people who shouldn't\nBut I never expected him to govern in such a conservative way he's far surpass my expectations for him I must admit he was not my first choice in the primary season\nI was actually a Ted Cruz delicate in my initial judgment I thought Trump was only better than John Case like which isn't saying much because ... will be a Democrat\nBut I have long since admitted that far from being the worst choice or the second worst choice for president he may very well being the only Republican that could have one\nIn fact I've wondered out loud and the caller suggested this last hour if president Providence was involved in this election\nAfter all a bomb had done you know talk about radically changing our country it might have very well been too late to turn America back of Hillary had one\nAnd I don't know if you know Bruce ... he ran against Barbara Boxer the but when she ran for the U.S Senate and I asked if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country and he answered of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost every single right\nAnd what's that also Providence I Wonder that we got George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most\nYou get no argument from me about gods involvement and now I think we got Donald J Trump with all this personal shortcomings when the country needed him most yesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election\nOf course that doesn't matter much either considering we try to catch and remember many of us thought he would be very satisfying\nAnd we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges especially for the Supreme Court so I thought were way ahead of the game when he points to Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court\nBut he didn't stop there\nLet me go through the list that caller wanted ending the Obamacare mandate opening up the Keystone Pipeline than Anwar reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy\nA significant tax cut I don't know why he talks about it but not enough Republicans do lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms moving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords\nWithdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal\nMeeting with Kim all young to possibly produce the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\nGetting American remains he's already done that returned from North Korea [noise]\nMaking sure our borders means something yeah color from last hour who knows what people are up to there just isn't it a coincidence that the coming right around the election\nAnd a mother who knows how they're getting paid how they're supporting themselves yeah I've heard local church groups and so on but this isn't just organized spontaneously\nAnd of course naming now for a second Supreme Court a choice a few weeks ago and he was successful another a break Kevin off the list goes on and on and the American people love that he is not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who Spain and Spain and spin that's where we are talking about last hour and\nAre afraid to say what they are really thinking you don't have that problem you can never say that about President Trump he may say too much but he never has two little\nHe is one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he has done a great job and most of the American people get but it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or that comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left this the Democrats and liberal listeners so maybe it was for this if the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected he's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nYou are dreaming if you think he's going to be defeated you a failed to get rid of him but not for lack of trying you start in the day he won\nActual we now know that they start their resistance again ... against the much before election day but once the election day came they couldn't believe that this so called bumbling fools had won\nSo bumbling but he's still one no matter what the upper lead of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed he won\nAnd I almost I mentioned this last hour in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania\nWhich always seemed like the Republicans fool's gold now we're always going to win around there was going to win an W is going to win it but not only did he win but they are despite their best efforts he want\nHe still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the color persecution\nOr is that prosecution got to think about that which was which one is that no matter the hostile media no matter the never Trump hers no matter all the elites and the swamp President Trump is still here which never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor pointed\nAnd including the best efforts in terms of the bomber it won't work even though they won accused him of being responsible for the bomber he's accused of everything and anything they can come up with he still hear\nIt never should have happened with the ... investigation of Moffat Jeff Sessions as an aside I'm disappointed you never recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nBut typically politicians talk to our adversaries did she talked to the Russians remember the reset button remember Obama saying that he was reelected that he would take care of it and you know they work work it out\nAnd he promised that off Mike\nSo all of this you know I'm disappointed in sessions\nDisappointed is lack of oversight should fire Rosenstein but the fact is President Trump has defeated all of this and as we said last hour the press can handle it they can't accept that this guy talks back then he says well we've been thinking all these years\nThat's why people are so thrilled with him finally we got someone in the Republican Party that had some courage it's about time that someone standing\nUp for what we believe in [noise] let me know what you think eight eight eight nine seven wants age eight eight eight seven to nine to one seven to for three more cash for filling in for Larry I'll\nCall

there we protect our country\nExactly exactly I I was going to talk about illegal immigration I'll probably save it for money a Monday when I shall incidental\nBut you're absolutely right we would never let anybody with no documents come into our house and say you were undocumented right to that would be legal we'd never let anybody go to a bank account and said the bank I just don't have the right documents but give me the money give me more money no one would ever allow that what you allow people to look at Maxine\nWaters have got four hundred million dollar home she's got a friend she's

me tell you a story and everybody out there that a large mom viola told me years ago she was working at the polls that just shows the power Maxine Waters in a constituents have no idea what she's

Maxine told us to come in here and vote for these candidates they act like sheep but if you could name a city or a school district where the Democrats have helped out the minorities to get ahead in their lives have better schools\nThat live in such a chance to live the American dream but yet they keep voting for these people you just wonder\nHow they do that when we know what you think eight
