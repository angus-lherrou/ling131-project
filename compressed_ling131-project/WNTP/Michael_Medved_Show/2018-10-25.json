Iraq Obama\nWhy not he's president the United states\nAnd uh he did get the tone I think pretty close to just right at the beginning of his rally last night Wisconsin a lot of people are saying oh what's he going to say in Wisconsin in federal court fact people in the media are freaking out they say he's blaming the media for this whole thing he is not\nHe is not their distorting what the president said here is what he said the very beginning of his rally in Wisconsin of course all of this for the midterm elections which are coming up twelve days from today here's President Trump\nBegins and I'd probably by addressing the suspicious devices and packages that were mailed to current and former high ranking government officials [noise]\nMy highest duty as you know as the president is to keep America\nSafe that's where we saw\nHas conducted an aggressive investigation and we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice hopefully very quickly [noise]\nAny acts or threats of political violence aren't attacks on our democracy\nItself [noise] no nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political and Jim ... co workers your or control we all know the\nSuch conduct mostly fiercely oppose an firmly prosecuted\nOkay this is entirely right\n... ... what is the problem people have with this\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number or because it seems to me that the president got lost he cheers there from conservatives I haven't heard a single conservatives say well you know what people who got these bombs or deserved it\nOr don't want anyone stood up to try to defend the mad bomber whoever this person is\nI I don't think so certainly no one on the right has anyone on the left stood up to defend him or her I think it's probably a guy a ...

went on CNN [noise] of a lot of people calling comparing President Trump to Hitler\nAnd know that is not appropriate and yes that is disgusting and it's inappropriate so the president is speaking well I I Know he's reading from a teleprompter I Know it's prepared for him but that's what you want for goodness sake this is a time where he has to be careful of his language and he was\nBut then he added this and this was the controversial part of Israeli speech last night and I think what he said was absolutely one hundred percent correct\nAnd highly defensible listen\nMe also has a responsibility\nStop the endless hostility and constant negative\nAnd oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\n[noise] okay why is it not possible for people\nOh say on CNN or MSNBC or on CBS or any ... any of them to acknowledge that the president is right about this but instead of that we heard this from John King on CNN in response to the president's remarks\nNo one's blaming the precedent set it up I mean the president\nUh but the president that wants to make this about him um amen to the president for what he first said yesterday\nLet's take a breath everybody told her down\nLet's just see where the fact that what the investigators do their job we can all be better\nIt's our fault why\nOkay she never said it was your fault the president's words where the media all the responsibility to set a civil tone and stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks\nHe didn't say it was your fault he said that if we're going to be better as a country and that is one good thing that could have come out of it it's going to have to involve all sides and everybody and er here was I'm Caitlin Collins on CNN or\nYeah we we will get to that at at actually arguing with Jeffrey tube and a ... says the most in temperate things about president I Know he's a fan of the idea of impeachment and removing President Trump from office but even Jeffrey

our upcoming election and just confusing compound the people involved and cause a little bit of a man and quite\nFrankly I'm getting it makes America look bad and they I I and that's my uh my wife is a clinical psychologist is convinced that it's the Russians who knows we'll see but her\nIdea is that this kind of thing and not only makes Republicans look bad because everyone's assuming it's a Republican\nBut it makes our country look bad because uh if if you're having very prominent people whose safety is being threatened in this way by bombs that aren't even that well made it looks like a

would think you are a nationalized then if that's what the definition of the word that you're using what'd you say your one\nProbably not you know I Would I mean I don't I you know I there's someone

election\nOf tell me why what is it that is exciting you and turning you on about this one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd one of the things you don't get to vote on is I'm Megan Kelly because no matter how much you want to continue watching her on NBC's Today show\nApparently that's not going to be possible\nAnd this particular case is one of those where I think that people who were treating this treating her as a victim\nOr treating her some kind of horrible criminal or both wrong or what Megan Kelly displayed in her interchange on NBC about black face and Halloween blackface uh costumes\nDoes not represent racism and it doesn't represent innocent victim mode either it's just represents colossal monumental indescribable stupidity she's a lawyer she's obviously a very bright and capable TV journalist\nAnd for goodness sake given the fact that she had just a couple of years ago a huge explosion of well deserve controversy for her insistence that Santa Claus was white\nAs she should have been able to watch out on this\nBecause what all of this is based on as she was commenting in a discussion about a Halloween masquerade which looked truly awful frankly uh by Lewis Land a lesson to his one of the real housewives of New York\nAnd um she um she dressed up as Diana Ross and pose and put out pictures of it\nAnd uh and and Diana Ross and of course has very um a light skin and as soon as she was trying to approximate that wearing a big giant afro wig and it looked awful and ugly and people were offended by it of course\nAnd a Megan kill they took it upon herself in a conversation on air\nTo defend the idea of dressing up in blackface for Halloween a very very stupid point to make but here's what it sounded like\nIt's really ... you get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on or a black person that puts on white we like that that was okay as long as you're addressing other character if it feels like something that's offensive to them then you should say it and that's fair if they're going to dress up like I Want to take yeah\nYou've got to be able to take it okay Allen broker of course veteran a weatherman on NBC or was one of the many many many people demanding that Megan Kelly apologize and er here here's what al ... had to say\nThe fact is a ... while she apologized to the shows are bigger apology\nTo folks of color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race\nWasn't right when I'm old enough to live to Amos and Andy where he had white people in black and he's playing to black characters and it was you know you're\nMagnifying the worst area and talks about black people and that's what the big problem is\nOkay yeah it is a big problem and by the way Megan Kelly saying when I was a kid it was okay to dress in black face she's forty seven years old\nIf she was a hundred and fifty years old maybe maybe it was okay or or even if she was eight years old or Ninety but I've got to tell you I'm older than Megan Kelly I hate to admit it but I Am and uh\nWhen I was a little kid it was emphatically not okay\nIf somebody had showed up at our Halloween carnival in my elementary school in San Diego California uh wearing black face costume for Halloween\nI think they would have been asked to go home it it has\nNot been okay for a long time a long time\nAnd that's something that Megan Kelly as a graduate of the University of Syracuse in Albany law school and somebody who's been a TV journalists for a long long time honestly should've known her apology on air\nWas very carefully composed and it was meant to say for career obviously and it sounded like this\nI Want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nWe made her that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another\nA black person making their faith later or a white person making their darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it as it was a respectful and part of a Halloween costume old okay\nWell I was wrong and I and [noise]\nOne of the great thing and it's cherry getting comfortable [noise]\nI talk and sometimes I Would say [noise] and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface and use an awful way my country\nIt is not okay for that he'd be part of any Halloween [noise] otherwise\nI ... it kind of person [noise]\nBut I Do understand the value and being sensitive to our history the ticket and beyond race and ethnicity\nPast year has been so painful for many people of color the country failed so divided and I\nNo wish to add to that pain and the fence I Believe is is it time for more understanding war love more sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that\nThank you for listening and for helping me listen to [noise]\nAh well didn't work she suspended or now it looks like\nUh she uh she's not going to be on air on NBC and she's also dumped by CIA the talent agency major Hollywood talent agency that handles her so she's done by both but she may be able to collect a what's left on her sixty nine million dollar contract\nSo good luck with this I I Do feel there is something that first of all black faces disgusting and all you have to do is go back and look at some even some quality old movies I I'm\nOne of the films that that comes to mind is a wonderful movie called holiday and with Bing Crosby\nAnd it it's a lovely film accepted has a sequence in it with Bing Crosby in blackface singing the song Abraham about Lincoln's Birthday and pretending to be kind of an old slave and it's so cringe inducing its horribly embarrassing\n... an enormously popular a singer\nAnd just enormously popular and he of course was known for doing his shows in blackface do I believe that Bing Crosby and ... and were were horrible races I Believe that they basically shared some of the values of their time where\nIt's almost as if there was something funny something humorous about being black because it was so different and the whole minstrel show blackface history\nIs laments Hubble and it it is an indication of how far we've come or do I think there's any defense for Megan Kelly making making the case that uh uh that wearing black face on Halloween is okay no there's no real defense for it\nBut is it perhaps an overreaction to see her entire career go up in flames\nBecause of this one stupid passing comment\nWell it's happened before or with other people I again I I think it is appropriate and good that we are more respectful and more careful\nA meanwhile there is a piece over box that actually pretty amusing if you don't get routes wrong with blackface here's why it's so offensive\nAnd today Desmond Harris writes put down the black and brown face paint step away from the bronze or twelve shades darker than your skin that is if you're at all interested in not being walking symbol of racism Halloween wait what's wrong with black face\nA lot of people thankfully don't need this question answered to many it's obvious that it's a lazy non funny costume\nBad idea with a depressing history that is the opposite of celebratory people have even made very simple visual aids to communicate this and they have one circles I should I wear black face on Halloween sex circle says no\nI yeah it is a big ... know if you disagree [noise]\nHigh Michael nice to talk to you great to talk to you [noise] um\nSo I originally called in to say why I'm voting for the first time in the midterm\nUh good I Love it here and why\n[noise] well I think it's a way of expressing yourself all the yanks that people are saying and feeling right now like these ... reported bomber or these pipe bombs you know I think part of it is he ... and yet he is probably here she is probably a a dysfunctional person I'm Sorry I'm getting off track [noise]\nSo I'm voting because I think when people that are in power\nOr you disagree with them you tend to to look and see what they're doing and be paying more attention and so I think that the best way to express my feelings are about the situation and my lot in life is to vote and vote in the local level and the state is the best way to do that\nNot good for you as one way or the other but\nThey're no good good for you I can I ask are you voting for a Sherrod Brown where are you voting for congressman or when I see\nA ... at this point I haven't looked over their platform I'd listen to all the governor debates are those are and I'll I'll be voting for Cordray for governor um\nUh that's interesting why\nUm I agree with issue one uh mostly um I I thought he did better in the debates I feel like the viewpoints wind up\nUm\nIt after that that that's how that's how I took away when I took away from it\nWell I knew I was fascinating as you know Ohio Terry big time big league for President Trump won Ohio by nine points\nAnd in right now uh I Know the the governor's race as close a Sherrod Brown the very very liberal senator who really should be voted out but it looks like he is going to win and what this shows is the American people are not doctrinaire they're not automatic about their voting\nBut I I salute you Josh what you're saying about voting to express yourself to get involved\nIt's a good thing and it's the right thing and congratulations on that let's go quickly to David in Duluth or two for a okay we will go to David in Duluth, Georgia in just a moment\nAre coming up I Want to go to this idea [noise] of um [noise] this early voting and what it means and why it is that Republicans might be voting early\nMuch more than they have in years past and much more than the Democrats are doing this year we'll get to that and more with your calls coming up on them at that show\n[noise]\nBelieves was

I ... when you say can or can't\nYou can do whatever you want it is a free country but there are consequences and right\nNow there is a very different sense about a white person dressing up as a black person by putting black makeup on then it would be the other way around here would be one little point of advice\nI don't think anybody would mind if you just left off the skin makeup\nRight if you wanted to dress up like a Bob Marley uh we had a caller who apparently dress up as Bob Marley or you want us to dress up as a Freddy Mercury Freddy Mercury was a a Persian ancestry\nAnd yeah it's somewhat darker skin and okay\nSo we want to dress up as for friday Marjorie dress up as Freddie Mercury of the er of queen\nBut don't put makeup on your skin because it is that the whole process of darkening your skin usually in a comical way because if you look at some of the classic black pays performers they don't look\nConvincingly black it's not like Jimmy Kimmel Robert Downey junior and racing films are tight TV shows were\nTalking about it's like a cartoon it's a shoe polish it's it's it's black black not dark brown let us go to your calls and to um Pete in shoreline Washington Pete you're on the ... that show\nUs or Michael how are you doing I'm doing well outstanding um I agree with you that Megan Kelly may not have been the um [noise] she was not the poster child for

right you you you you have freedom of speech but you do not have freedom of consequences and look do I think that this whole thing is a little bit of an overreaction with Megan Kelly is passing comment I Do and I feel for her with that regard but she she could have been\nQuicker on this and certainly more effective it seems to me and responding\nTo it let 'em go to a Brian\nIn Schanberg Illinois Brian you're on the ... that show disagreement day\nAfter that happened to you luck to you a lot and you get away with a lot of slippery language and one of the one I'm calling about today is ... years spots for a Mac he made the point that seniors are getting what they paid for which is not true they're getting a lot more than they paid for that's ...\nThat's absolutely true and I don't as an average\nFor every dollar a senior puts it put into Medicare they're getting three dollars back\nOkay ... what I said I don't I don't believe that I have said that that seniors are just getting back what they paid for I Am saying that they are are listed in a program and part of a program to which they've contributed for many many years\nAnd they have but what you're saying oh by the way doesn't work for\nOld seniors it's not every senior who gets back more than he pays for but particularly seniors who are lower income so they paid in less to the Medicare system are getting a lot more back that's true so I'm not sure where our disagreement is here\nYou see no apply that you're only getting what you paid for but in reality I went on a on average on average ... right back a lot more than they paid in\nAnd on social wired and on Social Security as well which is one of the reasons and by the way do you know why they get back so much more\n[noise] because medical costs he goes oh\nNo it's actually cause our life expectancy keeps going up than in other words Social Security used to pay for itself because the life expectancy was sixty seven say only had to provide Social Security\nPayments for people for an average of two years and uh now our life expectancy is almost Seventy seven so it's very very different and much much more difficult to make the\nUh the numbers workout but your point is fair enough uh we we all do get more back from both Social Security Medicare than we pay in but at least we pay in something and when people talk about Medicare for all they're talking about people getting payments\nWho put in nothing not anything at all\nLet's go to a Steven born in Pennsylvania you're on the ... that show\nUp or down in New Jersey Michael Oh okay great um I I'm a white male drug being average old ... ... am I raised the [noise]\nUm the boy that's an interesting conundrum I by the way I don't think the dressing up\nIn in the\nClothes are portraying somewhat of a different racial orientation herself orientation or anything is racist necessarily I'd be very careful the racist word\nI think it's stupid and it's also probably not a good idea\nI don't understand why someone would want to upset anyone with a Halloween\nCostume it's my wife will last Halloween [noise] but I think she would make the case is the whole point of Halloween

Michael method\n[noise] smallest\nA multi million dollar contract with Michael Vick for example a black people are tired or the\nOr and way way way way of a hold on hold on hold on for a moment do you

the company he uh he's even acknowledge that he was guilty of what he was charged with and he went to prison for I think almost two years maybe more than they were\nThere were there was no evidence there but I Want to argue with the ...\nBut you're you're basically your basic point is\nLook I'm listening to hire ... people were being used\nIt is my ... my basic point by people like yourself\nHow am I using black people here out how am I I'm not responsible for hiring and they ...\nAs a professor at all to you you do that on a daily basis you okay tell me how how do you use the energy of black people this thing is not a racist issue most\nPeople I agree with you and I've had that consistently but what I I you just made an accusation that I use the energy of about black people and so now misuse it what are you talking about\nExample all people in the world our lack in them if you go by time study from years and years and years ago\nDemonstrates that the origin of life or their own every right I Am I I I understand in those\nGenetic studies will show that I may well be every bit as black as a Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee but go ahead\nSo so so why couldn't somewhat express themselves in the ... ...\nPeople can do it's just stupid and is going to be counterproductive I don't think that it dressing in a Halloween costume and going in\nBlackface means that you're a racist I Know people have done that\nAnd they're not racist but I think it's extraordinarily foolish to do it today and to try to defend it because there is such a thing as history\nAnd this is a an extremely depressing history I'm Ben Shapiro wrote a piece was was very good on this issue where he actually put up a clip from\nI'm In an old on musical comedy that showed what the black face really was like and\nLooking at that reality and confronting that reality is part of our history and that seems to me it's worthwhile than people come to terms with it [noise] and meanwhile you can continue
