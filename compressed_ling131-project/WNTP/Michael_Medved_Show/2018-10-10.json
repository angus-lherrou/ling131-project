buttons and even polling results\nDon't matter because I Believe there was a great red wave unlike anything we've ever seen in history and on the horizon and why because I Believe America's woken up to the fact that this is our last chance to say this republic in this great nation\nAnd we have one many battles so far and I thank God for President Trump every single day I prayed for his family but

other stories\nAbout how men are trying to obliterate women really\nOr we will we will get to that on the Michael method show we'll also talk to Bobby Jindal one of my favorite commentators and one of my favorite former politicians Bobby Jindal former governor of Louisiana former star of the Republican House of representatives\nAbout why beyond this election we desperately need a sane Democratic Party we do I even assuming Republicans managed to hold the house and hold the Senate it doesn't do any good for the country when the other side is just completely off the rails\nAnd and bizarre we will get to that with Governor Jindal and uh I also want to speak to you about the proposition of revolution and the civil war their voices on the left and on the right\nTo say we're in the midst of the civil war\nOr a cold civil war and may not be actual bloodshed\nBut when you have people ranging from Carl Bernstein to on the left and Thomas Friedman of New York times on the left\nTo people like Victor Davis Hanson on the right and they're all saying yeah civil wars here we're on the verge of fighting here is uh what Carl Bernstein had to say on CNN about why he believes were in the midst of a civil war listen\nBut I think one thing we need to understand is larger context of all of this and that is that we are in a coal civil war in this country a than these two events\nAre both of our investigation and the Kavanaugh nomination\nAre almost a the the Gettysburg and and the ... the absolutely essential battles of this cold civil war in both the Democrats and the Republicans unfortunately we are only understand that and are exploiting their\nUh instead of having two parties committed to finding out the truth in these two important matters we are now into serious tribalism here\nOkay Gettysburg and anti them\nGettysburg over the three day battle there were over fifty thousand casualties I mean fifty thousand or anti them bloodiest single day in American history there are twenty five thousand casualties in a single days battle\nAnd by the way both of those battles for people who know your civil war history and I know a bunch of you to do both of those battles resulted in the union successfully turning back\nAn invasion by Robert The late Robert de Leon the south in the army of northern Virginia had invaded uh Maryland and we're headed toward Philadelphia and maybe Washington DC\nIn the Eighteen sixty two in September of Eighteen sixty to win and teach them occurred the union stopped them ... by the way a that's part of the story in my book the American miracle and a battle of Gettysburg July of Eighteen sixty three\nAre just less than a year later another invasion of the north this time of Pennsylvania by Robert Daly in the army of northern Virginia and again the confederates were turned back okay here's my question in today's civil war if you think we're in the midst of one\nWho's invading who wears the invasion occurring because see that's what you had to do it Gettysburg and emptied them you had to turn back the other side\nThey were attacking your territory where is that happening in the United states right now one eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six is our phone number ... stuff to me and and again it it it represents both sides I'm very glad that want to pose this to our to our website over at National Review\nThere is a a very useful piece by Jake cost\nWho explains why Alexander Hamilton\nCould be the best source\nOf why we are not in the midst of some kind of civil war and now look\nOne of the points that Victor Davis Hanson makes and and a V. D. H. who is a a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and I've been privilege to me and I'm very glad he's been a guest on this show he's a brilliant historian and the one point that he makes that I think is worth considering\nIs that the reason he believes we are headed toward real civil war in this country is because unlike previous eras in which there were very very grave divides in the United states I just saw this new movie called first man\nWould show with rock star break Tomlin we went out and and saw that film last night and it's a terrific film about what it will be reviewing the coming up but the the the point about that era\nOf the Nineteen sixties and all of the terrible divisions that that wrapped the country and there was actual bloodshed and riots and destruction and all of that\nBut it wasn't geographical it wasn't so clearly delineated you know there was one of the things that the civil war people say is the California should secede\nOr by the way they're a ton of people who don't live in California who would say bravo go for it or send California whether it's thirty eight million people and uh let them go elsewhere by the way\nHere's an interesting thing and I would just we're just having this discussion over the weekend it at our Sabbath table\nWhich is that if you look at the numbers\nWithout California not only does Trump when a genuine electoral college landslide\nBut Trump would actually won the popular vote by over a million and a half Hillary's three million vote margin\nWas provided entirely by California and it's just California's different from the rest of the country didn't used to be it is now a and and by the way it part of the idea of ... different states seceding Massachusetts in New York maybe two\nAnd the Connecticut not yet but uh okay so you have a non contiguous country or they can all be independent countries there's a new revival up in Canada because of the true though administration of people calling for Quebec to be a separate country so why not\nLook I'm not serious about that and for the same reasons that Alexander Hamilton would argue in federal is number eleven a number of twelve\nHamilton says we are by nature one country because we're financially integrated with one another we're making money on one another we are not separated or\nIn a meaningful way we're we're going to make war on one another because we're all\nFinancially into enter locked we we had a story like that yesterday\nWhere there was a bar here in Seattle called ... and a group of college Republicans over at the University of Washington had said they wanted to celebrate the victory for Brett Kavanaugh by staging a beers with Brett party at this uh this particular bar\nAnd the bar responded to those plans by posting something on their website saying we try to be\nTotally non political we don't want to be involved in politics at all and therefore are the people who want to stage eight beers with Brett or for Brett party or not really welcome\nOkay there was talk that they were going to sue the bar because you can't discriminate in the city of Seattle based upon political point of view and a cooler heads prevail then instead of suing they just went in and had their celebration they weren't thrown out\nMoney was still good or they didn't insist on everybody putting on a magnet half they didn't insist upon a ... Hector ringer bothering the other clients they had their party and maybe there was some other people who are literally crying in their beer about Kavanaugh's confirmation is fine\nBut meanwhile the reason ... did not make a federal case over this was because they wanted to make some money that's a very good motivation now you could ask and this is a very profound question\nSo what happened with the civil war\nWhy was it that these cells in the north were financially integrated the answers they weren't that financially integrated the sounds had a completely different economic system in the south nearly half the labor force was slaves and everything in the south in terms of criminal law\nIn terms of religion in terms of politics in terms of the economy was based on defending the institution of slavery\nAnd that was the brutal reality it was profoundly different in a way that California I'm Sorry is not that different from Texas if you disagree and you think\nWe are in the midst of a civil war well I'll I'll give you some citations from people who agree with you and we can talk about it they're also one of the characteristics of civil war it was rather against brother well right now there's a congressional race\nWhere his brother against brother and sister [noise] will tell you about it and more coming up on that show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nOne eight hundred nine four five seven genes Seventy six Michael [noise]\nOkay can you give me can you give me one indication I understand what you're trying to say now than I Do but let me ask you this can you think of one law that either a justice Kavanaugh is going to shore up\nOr a law that he's going to strike down where he's going to act to keep power concentrated for white males which which laws are you most concerned about their\nUh what I signed a law start with you there does act equal right ... ...\nWell that's that's the that's the fourteenth amendment to the constitution and that's where the fourteenth amendment of the constitution\nGuarantees every citizen regardless of color or national origin regard them equal protection of the law right\nAnd go ahead\nOh that was quite a lot of faith or how are you going to get at a game on I'll watch it\nYeah but when you ... what what laws do you think right now concentrate power in the hands of white males\nAnd you name one because that would be unconstitutional\nUp a dialogue regarding equal pay what what was right that that's been the last in Nineteen sixty three right but that's not being put me in this lab\nIt of course it is of course it is if I Know I look Melvin if I dared to uh offer a different salary for someone based on his or gender alone\nOr I Would be struck with a lawsuit so fast and they have lawsuits like this all the time but the the point is and this doesn't mean that there are cases where sometimes people are opposed to hiring men by the way\nThere are cases where people are a whole post hiring men and some weather imposed hiring women but the idea that this this gender gap\nIn terms of pay is the cause of discrimination it has been answered so many times let me suggest you build a website of Christina hot summers\nAre a woman by the way who's written about this so persuasively and and the idea that right now this is a problem for our world will get into that a little bit more\nClose to two thirds of all graduates of four year colleges and universities in America are female and uh I I suspect so that by the time my granddaughter is twenty one's right\nWhich is a little while but by that time women will be earning more than men on average\nOr we'll be right back on the ... civil war or not\nMichael ...

indication that I think leads people to that kind of conclusion\nComes across with\nSome of the divides within families and we're we'll talk about a little bit later this hour about a particularly spectacular divide with a political family out in Arizona\nI Will get to that and just a moment but um in in National Review Victor Davis Hanson a writes how when and why has the United states now arrived at the brink of a veritable civil war\nAlmost every political\nCultural and social institution universities the public schools the NFL the Oscars the Tonys the Grammys late night TV public restaurants coffee shops movies TV stand up comedy\nHas been not just politicized but also weaponized Donald Trump's election was not so much a catalyst for the divide as a manifestation an amplification of the existing schism\nWe are now nearing the point comparable Eighteen sixty and perhaps past eight Nineteen sixty eight left right factional ism is increasingly fueled by geography always histories force multiplier of civil strife\nRed and blue states ensure that low Cal magnifies differences that were mostly manageable during the administration's Ford Carter Reagan the bushes and Clinton\nI'm at ... again or they they were going to have a ballot initiative on the ballot in California dividing that\nState into three different states which would be the\nWorst nightmare than than before even because then you have three California's not just one\nOkay um but the fact is the the initiative didn't\nQualify for the ballot was ruled off the ballot by the courts in California\nAt seriously it is very very small numbers of people who actually in California one to secede even with Trump is president and it is not true that Governor Perry said the Texas ... should secede when Obama was president\nPresident a and this kind of talk\nOne of the things that people said about the civil war and it was literally true it it was brother against brother Mary Lincoln the first lady of the land wife of Abraham Lincoln had a brother who was in the Confederate Army\nIt was a real division she was from Kentucky\nAnd ah in Kentucky particularly that that was a it to Kentucky did not officially leaves the union but there were a lot of Kentucky Confederate who personally did\nIn any event that idea of family division has been highlighted in this crazy situation involving Congressman Paul ghosts are of Arizona\nAnd his opponent whose name is Brill I just took out an ad\nThat features six ... six of congressman go SARS nine siblings that comes from a big family and the six siblings basically attack their brother\nAnd not because he's a bad guy not because he cheated them not because it was a person of low morality but because he is an outspoken conservative here's the ad a that was posted by congressman goes our own it\nAll those are the congressman isn't doing anything to help rural America Paul's absolutely not working for his district if they care about health care\nThey care about their children's health care they would hold them to account if they care about jobs they hold him to account if he actually cared about people in rural Arizona\nI bet he they fighting for Social Security or better access to health care I better he I bet he would be searching what is the most and fight for water policy to help\nThe environment of Arizona's sustain itself and be successful thanks\nThere's not listening to you and he doesn't have your interests at heart\nMy name is Tim gross or David ...\nIs our Jennifer ... pogo SARS and my brother my brother and I endorsed Dr ... doctor barrel whole\nHeartedly endorsed Dr David borough for Congress\nOn Dr David real and I approve this message\nOkay I don't approve this message I mean honestly I'm now a\nPogo SARS said look they have a big family that some political disagreements but he doesn't not get along with these folks here is the way that they reported congressman goes harsh response on ABC TV\nGoes or fire back on Twitter saying not one of my siblings lives in Arizona they call them disgruntled Hillary supporters you can't pick your family does are treated to the six angry Democrat goes SARS see with mom and dad's house\nTheir mother weighing in telling the New York times or congressman son has done a hell of a job for Arizona and they love him goes R responded I guess I really am mom's favorite\nOkay apparently they all get together for Thanksgiving and mom and dad's house L all ten ... yeah it it could be an interesting Thanksgiving this year especially because I think a congressman ghosts are\nAnd and I don't agree with everything Congress and those are said or done but he's a good solid guy and he's a he's a strong conservative and and really uh

which I Believe is true and my point is a bigger Brett Kavanaugh would have been a confirmed to the Supreme Court if he was black and\nNo I I'm not I don't think I don't really see it on the weight I not only think so I Know so I Know for a fact\nThat he would be confirmed if he were black and I'll tell you why\nIt's two words as Clarence Thomas when Clarence Thomas was charged with a Nineteen Ninety One was more serious frankly because he was charged not for when he was a teenager in high school he was charged when he was a federal official and he was charged with a pattern of a repeated\nHarassment in a federal office and it was incredible just as the charges against a Brett Kavanaugh were incredible there was no corroboration [noise]\nUh and it Clarence Thomas thank God was installed spring forward by an almost identical vote so don't try to suggest that the decks are stacked against anyone who happens to be a black male it's tough to be a black conservative we'll be

the cabin on issue\nI Know every woman to know has had three or four cases of unwanted roaming hands very simple misdemeanor is a way to solve it and nobody's talking about it but the bottom line is what happened with cabbage is the rate of due diligence in this country we have to fight back those people should be mentally sentence\nSchumer took a vow\nI'm surely surely something is going on that might be worth our attention\nBut something else that is going on a that is very much\nWorth our attention is the forthcoming mid term elections where we elect all four hundred and thirty five members of the house of representatives and I believe we're electing thirty five new U.S senators because there are a couple of special elections there in the mix and uh\nHow's it going to go well it's a\nToss up and it's close but there is some very very sound advice it seems to me that is given to Democrats by a leading Republican and somebody who is one his own house elections by huge margins one two terms also by huge margins as the governor of Louisiana\nHis name is Bobby Jindal and he wrote a terrific piece that appeared in the wall Street Journal under the headline Democrats try some self

saying you were Democrats Democrats you write can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate their religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nThey can defend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on midterm abortions they can fight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods in lifestyle\nIf all of that is possible why do you like\nThe Democratic party seems to be moving in the other direction\nOr Michael I think this is really an important moment for the Democratic party and they have to decide are they going to listen to the most extreme base or are they going to try to become and remain a mainstream political party in the United states\nNow look at my wireless those another policy positions that they're certainly not going to appeal to conservative Republicans like me and I suspect many of your listeners\nI think by by trying to come to the middle of the Democratic party can actually recapture some of those voters who voted for Trump\nWho weren't consistent traditional Republican voter or they can make the decision they want to become angrier and even more radicalized and they look they really have a choice if they pursue things like trying to impeach President Trump or trying to teach Brett Kavanaugh insist on open borders they insist on abolishing ice or Medicare for all\nThose are great talking points on that excites their base and they can raise a lot of money from George Soros and folks like that\nBut I don't think they're going to win a lot of elections I I think that if anything there to help the President Trump wins reelection I think the worst thing they can do is to continue to go to the far left but I think they've got a choice to make do they want to come back in the middle or they want to continue to be the angry far left party\nOr ... ... one of the things and I heard this a a theory from a friend of mine is a long time activist in in Republican affair she has a theory is that what the Democrats are trying to do is to go so far to the less\nThan a there has to be set up a middle parties somewhere that would run some kind of quote bipartisan ticket\nAnd uh they feel that that that kind of middle party with a celebrity taking the middle was take enough votes away from President Trump to ah to to give Democrats victories in two thousand twenty what do you think\n[noise] I I think that if they decided that their plan President Trump\nDidn't start measuring the drapes already I mean I plan on being an office for another six years the reality is there there's at least thirty five forty percent of voters they're going to stick with President Trump to matter what he's shown that time and time again he had those voters in the primary against running against several Republican candidates he had those voters\nOr through his highs and lows of his campaign against Hillary Clinton and he's had those voters drives entire two years\nThe reality is look the Democratic party should stop focusing obsessing with President Trump for the Republican Party they should come up with a real solutions to the problems that are concerning the American people if they continue to go to extremes you know the problem that the Democratic party has right now is that they're trying they're trying to persuade anybody they're simply trying to fight and motivate\nThe most liberal members of their base\nAnd and they practically given up on the middle class working class voters that so famously went for President Trump now these are not always reliable Republican voters Republican Party cannot get complacent\nWe don't own these voters they're not going to be loyal voters but they will vote for President Trump and they will vote for Republican officeholders as long as they continue to deliver so as long as\nYou got to cut taxes and cut regulations have done what he promised him move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem is standing with Israel and the international stage is defending their Second Amendment rights\nIs defending the religious liberty rights he's on the conservative judges\nSo you know these are the voters that will go and follow and vote for leaders that are actually going to do what they promised that we're going to do President Trump is done if the Democratic party really wants to win back these blue collar voters many of them are union voters and many of them living in the heartland in between those two cos if they really want to get back to those voters\nThey've got to stop the the crazy rhetoric they've got to stop the extreme policies I'm not optimistic they'll do that but I I wanted to leave lay out the choice that the party faces\nYou can already see the Democratic candidates they're gearing up to run for president twenty twenty they're already trying to run that they're competing to see who can go for this to the left\nAnd their policy positions are becoming even more radical but one simple example you listed as a few examples they can be promoting couples them that doesn't mean they have to reject faith or traditional values from the public square\nPatriotism for that matter because you write\nThat they've almost made it into a ... for some reason the Democratic party think that's a winning issue to put down the American flag or or put down patriotism are being proud of being an American and I just don't think that's a winning formula to be being a majority party in this country\nAnd by the way that's one of the reasons I think is so important that Ted Cruz wins this race in Texas because ... is really bad for the entire farm on his support of a kneeling during the national anthem for pro football players\nAnd ... again ... this whole idea that we can have American is Haitian uh I mean you're you're a child of immigrants uh my mother was an immigrant to this country\nAnd I'm One of the things that's great about most immigrant families is patriotism love of country loving America but the Democrats by running against that\nA ... it's it's a disaster let me give you a challenge governor Jindal which is that\nUh would you write a balance the Democratic party I Know a lot of our critics there are a lot of people on the left to say it's even more true about the Republican Party they've gone so far to the right they lost the mental they've given up on the middle of what do you say to people like that\nOh look I think a couple of things I think both parties are absolutely guilty of thinking they're permanent majorities and I hate us in the column and the reality of the voter to always have to remind them unfortunately if you think about the middle east everybody remembers\nWho hurt them yesterday and they would they want to get their avenge tomorrow and in both parties are certainly guilty of that\nBut just look at the Kavanaugh hearings as a great counter example look Brett Kavanaugh was not the most conservative justice that the president could have nominated he he's a fairly moderate establishment figure a Republican now I Am not a moderate ... between the two parties\nYellow graduate yell undergraduate or graduate you know he went to a very good schools worked in the Bush administration\nAnd even before the allegations came out against him he looked at the Democratic history on exist that extreme reaction\nAnd I think what you see it as you see this extreme overreaction from the left\nI Would argue that look certainly there are folks in both parties that that go to extremes\nBut I think when you look at what the president is actually done in terms of cutting taxes cutting regulations in terms of the growth we're seeing the American economy\nThis is what a majority of the American people want it now that the reason he won election and this is a very important point he didn't say one thing get elected and then do something else everything that drives the Democrats crazy about President Trump he absolutely promised on the election trail he was going to do these things\nAnd that's why he won the reality of it is not that voters or or you know the fact that Trump voters are disappointed in him or what he's done they're actually getting what he promised them on the campaign trail so\nBut I I think the Democratic party has got a fundamental choice\nI think part of the problem is that when you look at the activist base you look at the donor base they will punish Democrats that want to compromise you know look the Democratic party already made up their minds when Kavanaugh before the hearing started they they tore person on that committee almost every one of the months ago came out and said they were going to oppose them\nAnd I think they're trying to appeal to the most liberal donors most liberal activists\nWhat they forget that was that's not where most American voters are most American voters don't want to abolish ice most American voter\nDon't think that the police are across the board you know out there trying to hurt innocent people most American voters want to stand for the ... the American flag and most American voters are to your point patriots I'm reminded when asked President Obama about you know he did he think America was accept Sean and remember that kind of wishy washy answer\nYeah he said yes we're exceptional the same way that Greeks think Greece's exceptional and Brits think Britain as ... as an exceptional in other words we're not a but I'll tell you who's exceptional abs Bobby Jindal his piece Democrats try some self restraint\nJust appeared in the wall Street Journal and it's terrific a governor I Know you have to run we will look forward to talking to your next time and we will be right back on self restraint and politics on the ... that show with your calls [noise]\nYou an author I have been in this place for many many years but one of the poll mold that ... that comes on frequently during your show in Houston it talks about war it's all about we're in a war and so and if ... you're listening to talk radio\nCalls talking about how the war we're having with the ...\nI I think as as you know I I agree with you that does happen and I think it's unfortunate and I don't think you will hear that rhetoric on this show because I think it's wrong I don't think this is a war I and I'll tell you why David and I've said this many times of the goal of a war is to destroy the enemy\nTo kill him basically and uh the the goal of politics is to persuade people\nMichael is your friend who said it is so don't know I'm a yeah OK you particularly don't say it but if your friends who for people who you are\nOkay you know what I you probably have some friends who has some strange ideas to write\nThis strange [laughter] wait a minute wait a minute what about Beto O'Rourke\nOr not my friend I I'll probably vote for him but he's not a friend of mine\nOkay we'll do vote for him or because again if you do that you're encouraging this leftward drift of the Democratic party David I I'd like to sit down I imagine that you and I would find a lot that we would agree on and by the way I Do agree with your basic point that's why I went to your call first\nIs because I think it is true that this tendency also exists on the Republican side\nBut I'll tell you what was very refreshing demand I think it's one of the most important speeches in recent years when Susan Collins spoke on the Senate floor\nEvery word she said about a justice capital was measured it\nWas balanced it was persuasive it was none of this rhetoric\nIs the other side is all wrong and we're All right\nAnd this is the basic point because even if you leave out the independent voters the people who vote regularly and they go back and forth to Republicans and Democrats\nThe biggest group of prospective voters in America that people don't vote on who aren't interested the people who represent this uh\nDaniel Tosh uh who are dumb as blank and move don't vote and don't pay attention to try to get people to pay attention it it doesn't work to say that\nWe're on the verge of Armageddon and and we're all getting ready to\nKill each other you know what it actually works better it seems to me [noise] St Louis we have some good ideas about how we can change things for the better\nAnd in the

[laughter] this is the world of ... and ah these things these images were\nUm posted on V. contact which is um the Russian equivalent of Facebook and\nThis is just one of those things where when

they should like ... they should be and I'll I'll tell you why so that we can get some I told you so rights when they end up losing their dream of taking over the house because if they take over the house this way with this kind of political appeal\nIt'll be incredibly bad for the country or I mean you could say well it will ensure that President Trump gets re elected 'em because the Democrats will be so so hateful\nBut then we have two years to go through and there's no telling what kind of security damage what kind of damage\nIn terms of protecting Americans in terms of border security in
