Seventeen year old as I said it it it's its own category of evil when ... when the children or or sexually attacked [noise] but anyway go on [noise]\nAnd I think for me the overriding issue it's for the most part I agree with you I did I think that here we are teenagers\nReally matters a lot in terms of their life will lead to adult et cetera however think contrition plays a big part in that I think that if we make mistakes and our younger\nAnd we are appropriately contrived it up that we have a desire to I could change if we have a desire to make good with that people that we heard\nI I don't think that happens in all cases and I think that at this issue is just a broad general issue\nAnd it it's specifically related to the to the topic that brought it up and it turned out that I'm Kevin I was guilty about something and then was not contrite no he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court I personally believe that he's not guilty because they got to take them I didn't believe her story\nI Want to bounce off of all of you nationwide something that is striking my taxes audience\nBecause I don't know if it's geographic out of its ideological I don't know if it's objective I don't know if it's wishful thinking um because it is also fresh so new and so ever changing hour by hour usually I've got a pretty good um you know radar on on what is the inside my bubble\nAnd and looking outside my bubbled to make sure that my wishful thinking or my politics\nDon't in the news of the things that I Would say that that I consider to be objectively true so here's what I'm Talking about\nThis attack this near a campaign against Kavanaugh is backfiring big time\nOr around the country fair minded people not all of them conservatives some of them don't you want capital and the guard but they have the basic human decency to realize a a disgusting eggs are crumble near when they see one\nI absolutely believe that feel free to corroborate it or deny as a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you know the numbers or follow me on Twitter at Mark Davis and they are K Davis always go to the Michael amendment showing Twitter at\n... show and Michael ... dot com and even when the filling the guys are here right so uh I I've just I've talked to so many people and I've read so many things and I've talked to other people who do this for a living\nAnd they're telling the same thing that that people are sick of this that it it has become\n... and ... it has become ludicrous we've gone from a a an allegation of sexual assault that was worthy enough to bring a woman in an effort to sit down and share her testimony which she did\nA that story is falling apart there is no corroboration of it and the subsequent stories a New Yorker and among the arm of ah of\nAttorney Michael ... those those ... those are less credible and Dr Ford and that saying something\nAnd and now we're getting into ice wars and uh and and didn't admit to sweat Nick who doesn't remember whether that was Brett or not at or near a punch bowl but he had some red solo cups and I wasn't going to take a red solo cup from Brett Kavanaugh\nIt it it ... its feet are on the absurd it has gone from political theater to the editor of the absurd I wrote a town\nHall dot com column this morning posted the dawn my time so it's been up there for a few hours out to share a couple of thoughts from it\nAnd um and then get some thoughts from you got some audio Richard Blumenthal [laughter] which is always enjoyable there's just something delicious leak\nTwisted about Richard Blumenthal democratic Connecticut lecturing anyone about truth telling Mr stolen valor they these folks they they are bad no shame they just have no shame will also try again to diagram sentences for Mazie Hirono is just just always an adventure\nUh and and one bubble tracked the moving the goalposts and just sort of see where it's all going so my question for you I have an overall broad question for you\nA ... and that is is is what's happening before our eyes\nWhat is happening before our eyes I strongly feel that the nation is on to this campaign ... late there are plenty of liberal plenty of Democrats and many of you listening and I'd love to hear from you as well 'cause we take all comers although Michael ... as you know Michael does that what he's here and I do it every any show I'm hosting Meyer somebody else's I\nAbsolutely welcome opposing views\nBut I Will tell you something and and we had a little bit of experimentation with this yesterday here's my belief\nShowed me a twenty people\nWho want to obsess about Brett Kavanaugh's calendar\nAnd who are just so convinced that his testimony just doesn't jibe with what the realities of early eighties party life we're\nFinding a mate among those twenty people are some folks who are really concerned about judge Kavanaugh's temperament I I mean oh my gosh he he really blew his cool and in some questioning would they be called the charge Sheldon Whitehouse and I don't know if we can have temperament like that\nThe court and blah blah blah blah buzzwords find me twenty people who are all twisted off about the side shows the irrelevant sees the ridiculous Nash\nAnd do you know what's driving every single one of them they don't want him on the court because he's a constitutional list they don't\nThey don't care about how he might have treated women when they were Seventeen years old because the people who are telling you that thing about probably have no problem with Bill Clinton probably have no problem with what Ted Kennedy\nBill Clinton find no problem Ted Kennedy find no problem but Brett Kavanaugh ooh no surgery can't go there that that's when you know that something else is driving the train and what's driving the train here in in this really\nIs so simple and once you understand it becomes easier to grass and you know what's going on here\nThis entire episode has nothing to do with the women are concerned about who did or did not treat her miss treat women properly in the eighties or any other time every single bit of this is smoke\nIs tomorrow\nAnd what's behind the smoke\nIs the true motivation and that is that the campaign against Brett Kavanaugh is being launched by and embraced by people who do not want a constitutional list on the Supreme\nThat's because constitutional lists do make stuff up in their rulings they don't make up right that don't exist like no right to terminate a pregnancy\nWhich was absolutely fabricated from whole cloth in roe v Wade in Nineteen Seventy three and this is extremely important\nI don't want roe versus Wade overturned because I'm pro life\nBrett Kavanaugh will not vote to overturn roe v Wade because he is a conservative or a pro lifer and by the way I've no idea what he'll do but if he's a genuine constitutionality will absolutely vote to overturn it not to forward his political views or his political agenda\nBecause judges should keep justice is especially should keep all those things out of there ... all that matters is is there a right to abortion and the constitution of course there is not\nLet's talk about the over ... versus a Hodges the twenty Fifteen gay marriage ruling thanks Anthony Kennedy for that\nAt this was a completely unconstitutional ruling that said that they not only that states could offer gay marriage equality because of course they can states can do whatever they want in terms of the definition of marriage but over yourself versus Hodges said they had to\nThey had to\nGo you've got to to make sure that women tend to board their babies I Know you've got to make sure that states a rule that to a marriage of two guys is the same as my marriage to my wife\nYou know if a state wants to end by the way that that conversely applies to abortion is what little constitution one oh one if you need at the moment roe v Wade is overturned in that they cannot come fast enough the moment rosy way to overturn what happens what happens\nIs the first answer is close to nothing immediately the answer is nothing but the ...\nSkate then left is every state can have whatever abortion laws they wish when over ... versus Hodges overturned every state can recognize the marriages that that you wish\nEstate number one wants to have full marriage equality to do two ladies ... whatever you want to do it's all marriage to us that's great\nBut at the state next door says not so much one man one woman that that they get to do that\nIf state aid wants to have an ghoulish leap permissive abortion laws I Will lamented if I Lived in that state I'd fighting doggedly against it but they can do\nAnd it's a state next door says new we're going to be very restrictive we're going to absolutely\nProtect the unborn in many many ways that we haven't even been able to do before that state gets to do that all of that that I'm just described hope didn't make you wreck the car or anything that's called respecting the constitution this is the kind of America that Brett Kavanaugh will help bring about in other words the ... the left\nAnd removing their ability to legislate through court rulings to get from the judiciary that which they cannot get from legislatures this has been an ongoing game of the left for decades and it is over when constitutional it reached the high court\nBrett Kavanaugh is just such a person God Bless him\nAnd um that's that's what it's all about because that that is the garlic too of empire that that is is kryptonite\nTo the left\nSo that's what it's all about it and nothing to do with everybody so concerned about Dr Ford listen we're all concerned about that for some map at our when Brett Kavanaugh's hands that I Wish her well I have no ill will toward her whatsoever or go leader good happy and prosperous life oh I bet it'll be prosperous her calendar will soon Phil [noise]\nWith a with a book deals and I'm\nSpeaking engagements a plenty I'm sure that I Wish you well I don't begrudge or any of that [noise] so let's get judge Kavanaugh on the court are we going to do that is that going to happen to

eight hundred nine five five one seven seven six we've been talking about what what is it look like and what the real fear the left is and why we're even involved in this entire\nYou know crazy mess with a a judge Kavanaugh's because the left fears of ... with a with every fiber of it's being a constitution list on the Supreme Court and so what would that look like what kind of rulings would you have and many many things like roe v Wade which established they phony abortion rights\nOr overt fell versus Hodges which established a phony obligation for all states to have a gay marriage equality that would be a state by state patchwork ... honoring the constitution looks like a with a question that we had Judy out all the city or in San Antonio Ron Hi Mark Davis in for Michael how are you\nOh great great I I guess Arnie or a little better for our attention on this they deciding state by state basis\nHow's that work because it's like back in or when you had interracial marriages were to be illegal in Texas but illegal in Oklahoma or legal or in Arkansas but illegal in Alabama or on that I Am I\nRight here's here's here's here's here's exactly here's exactly how it would work marriage one oh one\nIf two people get married in ... there are three levels of marriage marriages religious which means something comes up above promised they make before God but the couple does before God second it is social\nUh meaning does your ear people around you your family your friends consider you to be married to him in there so that certainly has the vibe of being married and the third is government recognition of yet that's the only one that's everybody's business the other to the social and the religious or none of anybody's business a gay couple can get married today anywhere they wish\nAnytime the only question is will the state recognized that marriage there's no such thing as a marriage ban\nNobody will ever bang on the church you all for you guys getting married in there they they absolutely can get married the only question is will the state recognizing that\nAn institution is our went up almost out almost on almost on almost done when the constitution is offered some states will recognize those gay marriages and some will not go ahead\nOkay uh so I ... in traveling across the country and they're in a state the ... when they got ... to ... I don't know what kind of travel that even if you go on abortion from state to state one\nWay back out and buy and I came back up to marriage back back up to marriage\nBut let's say a couple is married in Connecticut or to do to marry in Connecticut and their marriages recognized\nOr you just talking about there vacationing there driving across country or they suddenly not married as they pass through Kansas [laughter] no of course they are but the state of Kansas doesn't recognize it but it doesn't matter because they don't live there and the only thing that marriage the government recognition of marriage only extends to\nTax benefits in certain laws in certain ... certain mad or they're still married in the most important ways religiously and socially snuff they move to Kansas well that's another kettle of fish 'cause they're still married absolutely but it's not a marriage that the state recognizes with certain perks that come with marriage recognition\nSo it's not really that big a deal [noise] now what was the abortion weren't you want to go ahead\nWhat kind of the same thing or are they young ladies in a state where ... is\nLegal and she gets her you know right either done legally another young lady that they were illegal but she gets it done illegally she can be tried for murder for the maximum I did in another state that it happened to be legal ran a red green direct I liked states right now to be slow\nDown the name of that that's what it looks like that that's exactly what it looks like if if a state has he has ghoulish permissive abortion laws well there you are if another state protect unborn\nAnd the young lady violates that violates that law and the doctor violates that law than whatever is on the books for violating that law\nWould happen that that this is what the founding fathers thoroughly intended as it that's why we're not a of a homogenous just America where the United states\nOf America we're living in Florida is supposed to be different than living in in Oregon and living in Texas supposed to be different\nThan living in Wisconsin with some unless it's some things we share completely constitutional basic rights various properly written federal laws but a whole lot of other things that I have to do with the various angles and ins and outs of life are left to the states to govern according to what the wishes are the people who live in those states\nGod Bless her appreciate you Mark Davis ... back in a moment on his busy Tuesday\n[noise] my below is now offering a special deal buy one get one free go to Mike below doggone\nUsually promo goad Medvedev [noise]\nListen live anywhere in the world at W.

it's like sixty two tracks of old stuff on relief stuff alternate takes up stuff stuff that's been punched up a little bit by guitars Mike Campbell and\nUh and keyboard player Ben might change and it is it is as its name suggests and it is what it subject was\nAt American treasure so I'm\nTom Petty currently a rest in peace one hopes already a\nPhone number is one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and we are in San Antonio crashed hey Mark Davis and for Michael how are you doing\nMark how you doing good thank you great great\nHey all is obviously a liar because\nThe Y\nFind gold is a three man and one woman not right\nSon to John Mark Davis getting soggy again I'd I'm trying to get all these guests on welcome to I Want to get 'em on every show I can so here's a little are another check box or on the list is great that are a lot of\nPleasure and I love Dallas relatives in Richardson in Plano and they they listen to you almost religious [noise]\nWell I Do all that good at shows a certain prioritization that I respect well let's let's talk about the concept of respect um let's go well let's let's let's meet in the arena of colonizing I\n... the good people of town hall this morning with a a treat is that says something I Want to run by you\nThis is no longer just a Supreme Court confirmation of Kavanaugh's could fail it can be with you could withdraw himself he can be withdrawn and just offer up any Coney Barrett are castle engine and be just fine constitutionally\nBut these people cannot win the fabric of America is is is at risk here ... laws of basic decency basic human conduct basic behavioral norms they're all at at play here I Am am I being too dramatic\n[noise] I think what you're having the latest chapter in the saga of an ongoing disease which is our government has grown so powerful so all encompassing so able to bend the power of government to favor one group for people to another\nThat this is just the latest example of how our problem in politics is not too much money\nThat might be why another try and when there were problems too much power POW we are the founders never intended for the Supreme Court to be this powerful to decide things on the national scope with a single Tunisian them off in the five to four vote\nAnd as a result because all the power in my thumb on some issues especially the hot button social issues is concentrated in Supreme Court people will do anything to get that power anything and that's what we're seeing the Kavanaugh case\n[noise] well that that is where we are because legislatures can legislate a chief executives can do executives things and pilot certain programs through presidents are powerful Congress's powerful but they're all I'm a musical and they're all by biased by the Supreme Court\nAnd and that means that just when their disagreements they win and that's just all there is to it or is it or we mistaken about that\nNow the Supreme Court is are unelected branch and as a result um and of course it's a life tenure or we have term limits on the president we have um\nYou know elections every two years in the house of representatives every six years in the Senate but on the Supreme Court especially because the it's only nine justices someone gets on the court for life\nOr that can be in a lifetime of your side losing five to four decisions we'd be a whole lot better off if you remember that you know the first that no Supreme Court nominee ever appeared\nBefore the Senate Judiciary committee until Nineteen twenty five\nBecause the court wasn't that powerful now and in fact they didn't consistently started appearing until Nineteen fifty five now of course the Supreme Court is so powerful and so invasive in all of these areas of our life we treated like you know World War three whatever it is a TRACON the\nGum and seems like an event horses out of the heart isn't it a ... and I don't I don't see any way that we can ratchet things but in fact a thirty seconds on a conversation I had way here's a little name dropped that I Do on purpose\nMy friend Tom job and that he had the Institute for policy in the nation I Am wearing they're wonderful people and and he and I were having a conversation about that she said this whole thing about court supremacy Supreme Court supremacy if you will is just a mess their their co equal a that term equal should certify their co equal\nIt meaning that that if the Supreme Court says something okay fine\nAnd if a president disagrees with it\nShe can ignore it but then rather than chaos breaking out the public can figure out whether we like or don't like the president that ignores the Supreme Court and we can ... an elect him\nAnd there's a certain rough balance to that unlike what we had that you've just described which is all powerful tribunal that just runs our lives on their whim\nWell I Know that Abraham Lincoln Andrew Jackson ... and they talk about ignoring the Supreme Court and the ... you know those were and they bring in this case the civil war was around\nI Would much prefer the Congress exercise of power it's almost never used\nWhich is Congress can pass a law saying the court does not have jurisdiction over this area of our lives in other words we're going to take back the power we created the constitution created the courts the court's powers that infinite we take back some of it we limited jurisdiction\nI'm OK I'm singling now with with ah with with potential a list of making it might be in a rare\nCase of the Nineteen sixties you know the Supreme right out of nowhere said Madeline Marie O'Hare is right you can't have a Supreme Court you can have a a prayer to a Supreme Being and uh I guess today we we couldn't go out for Muslims progress not anyone else given how things are going but you can't have a prayer in public schools\nWell there was a big move in Congress and I think that if uh the times had been different and liberalism hadn't been renting renting Supreme back then Congress could have said no this is not the court's jurisdiction we take it back so the decision as null and void\n[noise] I and that's okay that's satisfying up to a point because I found Madeline Marie O'Hare to be as repugnant as a person\nA but but couldn't someone rightfully step forward and say a while of doesn't the pesky First Amendment when kennel legislature come in there and say that you could argue all day whether prayer in school is a First Amendment establishment clause violation or whatever but that doesn't that it's the kind of end of the argument before it began\nWell again um what the\nWhat the court had said in the rare case was this was a ... this was\nA violation of the establishment of religion claws well if you disagree with that Congress can step in is the people's representatives and say no we have a different view\nSo again that hasn't happened if I'm likely to happen but I'm simply saying that we are going to have to appoint a whole bunch more constitutional is people who are judicial\nRestraint people to the court because you know there are five people on the court if Kavanaugh is confirmed who don't have this expansive view of the Supreme Court's power have a more humble view\nAnd I think that that's the best way to handle this put people on the court who don't want to be played comic rulers of the rest of us\nPrecisely and and that is why a distance he would be the fifth that's why the left is is having a whole you know what's sad about that and that's what's great about talking to John Fund is as we can go very macro and now let's come back and go very micro or I Am feeling a little better about Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski a little\nBecause I think they were willing to vote for him before the FBI we should placate them Jeff Flake is a wild card I have no idea what amount of ... going to want to have you lost your well of course while throwing\nHe will ultimately vote yes\nWhy what makes you so sure\nI Know Jeff and I also know that a lot of this is a well let's just say McCain disease I'm you know I think that Jeffers enjoying some of the media attention you know\nI I Hope that I Hope that the worst that's going on I really do but if you and God Bless Senator McCain but if you coined of the pathology that led him to go thumbs down on Obamacare repeal way why wouldn't ingest laying cattle have\nWell because there can be there you know diseases don't always take their full course sometimes they stop before you know you go over the cliff um look it's like flake voted for the nomination to go out of committee\nBecause she has me nothing dramatic is reveal the FBI probe would be a very strange for him will know on the floor having voted for uncommitted than almost never happens\nIn I I don't think it would be strange at all because I don't trust them I'm going to defer to you however I Am too personal experience and and then you and and be in sleep better a little bit because that is what he said\nIt is what he's made me crazy politically and the posturing and the Trump hatred has made me insane but he he he does he did say that he said give me a week and and I can be willing to vote for it on the floor I'm going to hold into that and it sounds like you don't think I Would be unwise and doing some\nUh I think ... I think the the the truly weakest link is actually looser Murkowski\nIn thirty seconds why\n[noise] uh because if she didn't face the Republican primary in Alaska and twenty twenty I think she'd be the most likely to vote against Kavanaugh the only thing that's preventing her voting against Kavanaugh is the fact that she faces a Republican primary electorate you've already lost one Republican primary and I had to come back and win as a write in independence\nHas a right and that's right well this is John ... the show just got three times better because of you thank you on Twitter at Johns ... National Review every place just go get every book he ever wrote just wonderful guy wonderful writer the great John signed on Twitter at Johns I knew it certainly makes sense thank you sir appreciate that area and watch [noise]\nOkay thank you you bet\nAll right big exhale Johnson says Jeff Flake is going to be okay and he won't screw us I'm taking that to the bank [laughter] I'm taking it to the bank don't mess with me man Mark Davis is from Michael ...\nI thought it was just part of the whole of his very defensive\nAh and on a [noise]\nYou know I'm condensing presentation on [noise] and I I\nTold someone later boy I'll tell you they give us a lot of credit\nThirty six years ago I\nWe started this again I guess I mean if it is back at Yale ... yeah well even before in high school apparently um you know I I I don't you know look I I Want the FBI to conduct as a thorough investigation as they possibly can within whatever restraints are imposed upon\nThem um but I think\nFor anyone who believe there is such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs and defendants with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about where I\nDo too I think that a judge Kavanaugh displayed exactly the right kind of radar for fairness because fairness ... from his every judicial poor\nIs it radiates from every ruling he has a very strong sense of fairness basic fairness basic decency\nSo that when those concepts are dashed against the rocks or those concepts are ex bloated\nRiding a vehicle of character assassination from the left\nIt is exactly his sense of fairness that infused his personality they're under questioning from those Democrats because Democrat tour mentors edited exactly that righteous indignation that human instinct that anyone would have\nTo sit on national TV and imagine\nThe woman you love and the daughters you love at home watching or having a just a circle back around into it it it into the ears of your loved ones that kind of ... lives being told about him\nOr her daughter has a sense of fairness she knows how to be fair on the bench and he knows how to react when the worst kind of vicious unfair to his level towards him [noise]\nParty posters more phone calls let's do it next twenty nine five times Seventeen Seventy six and in fact somebody asked of Hillary what she thought of Dr forge testimonial play that for you as Well Mark Davis and my comment bed sick around It's Tuesday\nWhat I'm hearing is not only offensive and shameful it's dangerous of Michael Mann vigil\nOne eight hundred nine five five seven genes Seventy six Michael mad vigil [noise]\nNine\nNinety intelligent conservative talk [noise]\nFor that\nSort of news eyeball I knew in Washington as the FBI rushes to complete his background check by friday I'm Brett Kavanaugh says it's up Republican GOP Senator Mitch McConnell says lawmakers will vote the full Senate voting on capitals domination by\nThe end of the week President Trump says he was abnormal at college because he didn't drink alcohol and everybody else to the president's second references to the fact that\nHe does not drink alcohol and never has he says it came up in connection with the red capital Harry's which he admitted it being something of a drinker when he was in high school and college meanwhile the president says he is pleased with the response to his proposed trade agreement with Mexico and Canada but deals still has to pass muster however with Congress\nOn Wall street at the closing bell without Jones industrial average enjoying a one hundred twenty two point gained the session at twenty six thousand seven hundred\nSeventy three the NASDAQ struggle that was out there to seven points this is ...

hey if if the entire country was run more like taxes we'd be a lot better off and you know what lately looks like we're kind of doing that so that proved I won't say prophetic that's hopefully with sensible that's Lone Star America from twenty fourteenth\nThen in twenty six team in the election here it occurred\nTo me to do about a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty some talk show topics\nOf of subjects that the left has been getting away with like guns are bad\nHuman productivity has definitely warming the planet the constitution as a shape bubble malleable living breathing documents and other nonsense and and just a way chapter by chapter to gently McKay maybe not so gently but at least civil Lee and constructively push back against that\nAnd I put it together in a little thing called upside down how the left turn right into wrong truth and allies and good and bad\nThat's a lot of subtitle just to Mark Davis upside down on the Google or Amazon or Barnes and noble or whatever and there's the book and the hope you enjoy it All right\nSo the last gentleman and they took a little altogether was talking about how about about Supreme Court justices and boy you could say we've been talking about Supreme Court justice is a lot like late I'm ... and how it's so important and powerful because it's a lifetime appointment\nAnd the gentleman said it's not a lifetime appointment as a yes it is but I I\nKinda got his point articles reception on judicial branch judicial power judicial powers it's easy for you to say\nI'm the judges of the Supreme and inferior records show hold their offices during good behavior [noise]\nSo I don't really know what he was getting at is if it seems like there were things that there were offenses that a lot like maybe deciding wrongly in roe v Wade should've gotten a few justice is just tossed out onto the curb\nOkay I'm In a lifetime appointment a barring impeachment and and that gets tricky so uh what ... what led to do here is ... there there are two things that\nPeople have talked about term limits and age limits the get the more\nUnfair age when it's seen as I'm sixty not like to think I'll be around for a couple of do three more decades and uh and I I Know a ton of people\nWho are sharpest attacks smart as a whip strong as an ox they're eighty five I also do some people who are forty court total idiots so I'm just seeing him wildly arbitrary no term limits\nTerm limits boil down to one saying turn over for the sake of turnover I think the founding fathers envisioned a I'm a citizen legislature but you know uh\nThey didn't put term limits in there I guess they left that up to us well we finally did it uh for the presidency after FDR was president for thirty seven years [laughter] I Do I Do a\nAnd a twelve or Thirteen but we didn't we did that and I guess I did that I think we're probably all on board for presidential term limits turnover for the sake of turnover especially these days seems like a good idea uh\nEverybody talks about term limits in Congress oh we we get a job I could fill up the lines right now everybody just banging the table for term limits ears the dirty little secret\nYou're ready not enough people on them oh you do I do\nYour friends do the people you hang out with do I could fill you know forty seven hours of talk shows that people who do you know what if everybody was so deep down about term limits we'd had him a long time ago so here ultimately has the bottom line the journey to the dirty little secret\nWe liked the idea of term limits\nIt sounds great but then when you realize\nThat that means you got to get rid of your congressman just to be under twelve years and it's usually the deal is six terms in the house two terms in the Senate both equally twelve years but that means you know what that means I mean I got to get rid of Ted Cruz after one more term I Want to get rid of Ted Cruz every one more term\nOh I Want to I wouldn't want to prove to be a senator Jill you're Ninety three\nSo\nThat's why I term limits never goes anywhere is a bit of ... and it just shows in the bowling approval ratings of Congress are terrible for approval ratings of people talking about their congressman tend to be pretty good so\nEverybody else should have to get rid of their congressman you don't want to get rid of your bears so there's the whole cut on room of term limits so at at the judiciary level I mean what do we get to a a Thirty Years'\nTwenty years I don't know I don't know um [noise] I guess I really thought about
