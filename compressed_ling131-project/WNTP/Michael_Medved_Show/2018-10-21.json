category so\nOf ones don't worry bad to be exposed to ... do the sex trade treatment improve the the ah the health of the trees are probably go away or for sure help you with it for next time next

from coming down at least for a short period of time if you don't hold him in distress if it continues to rain or the tree is too deep underground or you're still using synthetic fertilizers or

completely healed or whatever or issue you've been having it um it's a heck of a deal because it costs nothing and you might find out that there's a stem cell therapy might work\nFor you like it did for me you can call a ... a two one for seven to seven one seven one five to get this free consultation meeting a and a and go from there so they were all about whether a\nHe thinks it would work for

it's a good idea again that number to see whether or would work for you an artist too warm for seven to seven one seven one five\nBack to the phones here is um so yeah Dave's first in Fort Worth tell Dave\nMarr inherits I got\nA couple of a NATO palm trees and a\nPlanet I don't know five years ago one of them has a mound of aunt that filling up the side of it I say the trees\nOh probably five feet tall and that's now that comes up about a foot and a real small aunts and there's a lot of them and I was wondering if she had an idea that if they're doing any damage or if they are and if so how you ...\nWell if it's a male and there probably are firing on the eve of you know so we probably want to do something about um whether they would be I doubt that they would be damaging the plant are you seeing some disk coloration or anything and the foliage\nAh no I think that's probably a mortgage to a gym much why I don't think ... really really really small\nOkay well most most of the ... mountains as a thing that it's a throwing me they're a little bit of a bully in this case it wouldn't be a bad idea just to\nBe on the safe side use of two ounces of orange oil per gallon milk stronger than that of that and in fact he gave it a little bit less than that and drained should in there and kill 'em or use the pure grow product but like I was mentioning or one of this but no should products any of those three\nWould take care of it you could also put beneficial name into doing there but if you don't have fleas or picture something else going on the side you\nMight not want to uh invest the money and the time to put them out there not a very expensive but one of those other products probably better and those guys are they ride on the ... toward the needles are or where where is the mound\nFor the outcomes that are from the ground about a foot up and then then then needle palm itself is is that you know four or five feet in the air or about that what you're asking\nWell the the needle palm has needles or the name came from that come right out of the base right at the ground is our ally is that one of the mountain news\nYeah that's where the or the mound is okay let me tell you the sorry I'm Sorry go ahead\nI may be telling you the wrong I thought it was needle on it it it could be a Japanese something or other sucking you recommend it because it was cold hardy and uh\nSo it's kind of the trunk ... oh yeah\nOkay we'll need upon dynamic trunk is is a butcher shop is bushy bomb and has has needles coming out ride the bike in fact one of mine I moved from the house it was crowding a bunch of other stuff Japanese maples and\nThe things that I moved down near the dog run and his ... Nelly our tree climbing dog likes to run Ninety miles an hour through the bed to get to the dog run when she's going out\nFor a treat and I'm worried for a long time that uh she's gonna stab herself with those needles I think she's figured it out though 'cause she's got a little scar owner foot I think she got into it one time and learned that it wasn't a good idea but you might Japanese I'm a fan ...\n... that's what it is yeah that's it\nSo yeah just the same thing same answer just go ahead you can ... my around in a in Springfield would ... natural to measure served drenched or a little orange oil in it like I said or some for no should\nOne of the central all products the any of those things will knock it out and make them move if nothing else if you put out drama last is on the whole site\nOr if ... that'll take care of them\nYeah I don't think they are just the stream Lee small but ... says\nWill fire ants variant size in fact there's a photograph of the mouth come in and I put in our ah Texas bug both that shows\nThe the variation of size enemy of foods uh I think came from ... originally it was for real good photograph and it it shows the tremendous range of sizes that we are and it's going to have yeah\nAll right well thank out\nAnyway those are the things we'll help you know don't have to worry about thanks for the call for like\nLet's say what Paul's up to in Arlington, Texas like Paul\nLauded and stuff like Lakoff sure\nI have a question I have a a comic ought to a pot ... taste subtly I've foul I saw a lot of like a black spot on ... ... it up as like a pound a\nThose are not quite the flow of for the tree or if it is so ... how they actually it it\nWill Paul that's probably the mole the mole is a fungus and usually come from the waist the sticky wife's like I was talking about the trees earlier that come from either a foods or scale owned the trees so you've got some\nFungus which it's more of a cosmetic fungus the the damaging to the plant but she probably is some insects owner as well what kind of fertilizer program or using with the ...\nUm I used the one that caught chops or the stinky that steak guy\nBut I've got two different kinds I got one that's synthetic fertilizers and ones that organic do you remember which one you used\nTo get its organic\nOkay that's okay I'd recommend that you go with a granular fertilizer or liquid\nLike Garrett juice from this point forward and I think you'll have a little bit better luck make sure that the ... of ... just like a tree out on the side trees\nTrees in pots need to have the fires dramatically expose a lot of times\n... come to you when you bomb from the nursery to deepen the container and you end up getting them all to deeper so I Would imagine this the insect problem is a result of it being a little too deep you can take it out of the container break all the soil away put some new fresh organic of I'm fighting\nSoil and compost in there and said it back at the right height\nAnd why not go see that much difference from now through fall but next growing season you're probably see that you won't have that the problem at all did you have income carts this year\nOh yes uh this this trees that plant at about ...\nOh yeah ...\n... ... s spraying okra\nAt all I keep it a\nA proton didn't want to say yeah cause a ... year but I just want to keep the ... uh-huh\nAnd it's very back and they share a place that's out of the water or a tree I think she has a ... right out of the church that could be that when the rain calmed down ... my ...\nWell you may have stress do a little bit of Paul by putting in the shade it needs to be in full sun all the time\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah so I Try and sounds like you've been doing\nGreat if you get in free production for ten years it might not be too deep in the soil chances are it is a little bit you know so you can make it even healthier than it's been you might even want to consider if you've had it that long to step it up to a mix sized pot a little bit a larger pot\nAnd not you know it sounds like you know about the ... as well as anybody to wonderful little freaky toll finding peeling and all and it's delicious yeah just like any citrus flowers you probably already know this too with the flowers are edible and useful and tease Michael wonderful T as well any citrus\nNow that now that yeah how\nAmerica Vern I see so um do those things and I think you can keep it going even longer and then you since you've had a ten years I'm sure you've been bringing it indoors in the wintertime right\nThat's a yes All right it filed\nKeep up the good work that's great and in fact I've made a note here that I'm On a bike on Christ reminded me that I don't have one and I love them and I'm going to get anyone get going to\nSit at the un access spraying Cadillac class that I Can't get it was okay but great let's stay in touch OK well thank you aside by John Hezbollah\nAnd then I planted the tomatoes right into\nThe still their roots of the Harry ... didn't till they didn't fertilizer and do anything and they had tremendous production in better production then the beds where they too old and put it in fertilizer and all that kind of story\nWhat you're talking about I'm a mall and over in my mind the the problems that could come from it is burying organic material and was alfalfa you got some protein in their you know that's a wonderful organic fertilizer of alfalfa\nAnd it's a wonderful of top dressing most too because of the carbon nitrogen balance being so good as good as ... than a lot of ways you know\nI used it in my vegetable best or march a consistently good results from that\nWhile I'm a little worried about burying it is the is the problem Neal if you bury a twelve inches deep you're going to have twelve inches of soil on top of it is going to be kinda anaerobic uh there's not going to be made our decision down there and I\nThink that it's hot yeah it it's gonna\nProbably rod but it's going to run kind of an anaerobic\nWhy when the roots of your food crops hit that there may be some damage I'm not saying it's based on that idea 'cause I've never done it it just I'm just trying to think of what the possible problems with it might be why don't you don't you do this if you can\nSet it up to do that will set up an experiment here where you do that in one or more of the beds and then in ... or more of the bed in the bottom instead of putting hey let's just put native\nOil there is to actually inexpensive\nSoil that you can buy and then have the twelve inches ten to twelve inches of improved you know a ... type stuff above that and let's see which one works the best\nOkay that sounds good uh one other quick question about it as a ...\nI don't know if you use them long on those galvanized the after a number of years all the rest of the bottom right\nAnd uh what I thought of it try to deal with that is to or or paint some on the rubber eyes material or is or is there a danger of groups that something bad off of that\nWell there's probably some toxic materials and those things at once so hard known the side I don't think too much of it would be directly available to the plant so using a line or like you'd put in the bottom of the time on their\n[noise]\nLike I mean I'm Down to you about thirty people are being taken to hospitals that are for

you know there's a whole lot of different radishes you out ever\nColors and different sizes and all kinds of things and that ought to be on the list care which\nIs easier to transplant popular and

are the ... current and those kind of if you're going to do some transplants you might use the larger\nA growing of radishes for that terror it's also a good time for them they're much much slower

just went through a pretty nasty divorce and he's got a young son who has an Android throw my brother is an apple so he doesn't window Android\nIn the ... research a good track or so he knows where his son his when he doesn't have custody\nUm 'cause he's each he's a little concerned that his wife might be trying to\nI don't know do various ... okay I get I Would I Want your website and there's a tracker on there it's a free one that ... according to the website it up to ... hours and there was a notation saying\nThat if you wanted to you know paper one there are the ones out there but I couldn't find the other ones that you might recommend well does he see good\nOh no I was gonna say you know so here's the deal is that you know he the the the sun is going to know about the tracker okay\nAnd at twelve years old it's probably not a bad idea that the sun does know that there's a track or you know there's really no way to unless unless he could actually get the phone and install his tracker on and not have the kid no right\nI mean that's another issue okay alright that's sad when there's a a depending on the carriers of ... do you know who the carrier is\nA ... to ... okay if the mobile has it to 'em\nBecause he's probably paying for the kids' cell phone plan right\nI'm Sorry if you pay for the kids phone uh yes okay\nIs that the carriers they also they have something like family low care packages and the ... and it's like ten dollars a month but what I like if it's from the carrier and that not only can he see where the boys that but the boy can see where he's at\nAn okay and if the if\nHe had you know his grandparents where he want to even the normally you can have up to ten people on a plan\nOr a you know and you know there's also glimpse which is also something you might want to look at that but not through the carrier and that's G. L. Y. M. P. S. Glen\nAnd Glenda glimpse works a lot like find my friends but it works across platforms okay and so I Would look at the tea mobile website looked at their family locate her like I said normally it's like ten dollars a month for up to ten phones or whatever\nAnd then you know the boy can also you know the sun can actually have a sense of security that he knows if something does happen with his

one of our four hundred top stations from coast to coast it's called the ... show because after all I Know I'm Kim commando\nHey listen love to hear from you I'm sure you have at least one pressing digital life question that I can lend a hand to right now and the numbers simple one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is a way to join us once again that toll free number one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four\nAnd before we go back to all of your phone calls and we've had some great ones so far that show I expect even better was to come so called now is that we had some interesting items that crossed my desk and my screen that you just need to know about\nBut like for example this past week there was a huge tax fair in Japan now ten years ago if I were to say taxpayer in Japan you'd say okay it's all about TVs and DVR isn't home entertainment systems well that's not the case anymore\nBut hot now are these tiny little sensors that accurately measure\nWhat your body is doing and how your body is reacting by\nFor example Panasonic\nWas showing off an armchair that measures how much your hands are sweaty\nAlong with how your city and facial expressions are being tracked by a camera why all of this ... and dean tracked and analyze\nSo that this way you know how stressed out you are another company we're at a manufacturing has a small device that you hold for a minute between your thumb and you're for for anger and it measures pulse rate and the nervous system then there's this device that was created by\nA line for hygiene they say if you're worried about your teeth you can smile and a smartphone app and then the company will tell you about your oral hygiene okay there that Center for the tablet measures water temperature your poll and body temperature\nAnother sense in her crib and upload data to computer showing whether the baby rose onto stomach temperatures bags so this way an adult can get a text message if necessary\nThese sensors are just for humans by the way sharp you know the company they developed a kitty litter tray with monitor suing measures the cat's urine volume and frequency\nWhy because some reason we need to know that I guess\nAnd they also had a ton of robot came parents I Know you can relate to\nHow many times have you told the kids to clean up their room only for you to walk around the corner in a hallway and the family room in the bedroom and you step on a lego oh my gosh land goes hurt when you step on that here's a little fun facts where are you a single\nBrick and support nine hundred and fifty three pounds of pressure before compressors that means when you step on a lego the lack of give is what makes it hurt so often and so hard\nOr at a start up with money from Tokyo showed off a robot that can pick up toys can pick up close up the floor and put them in their proper places yeah they're going to sell these robots that could clean up put the dirty paid to the dishwasher\nThese objects through built in cameras overtime at wanders around the house takes an inventory of all the household possessions\nOr they say maybe all these robots could help keep the kids entertain so they wouldn't be on the X. box or the pet anymore and I know what you're thinking sure I mean I could totally aired without screen time I could also turned my own butter but let's not get crazier\n[noise]

books can you actually fit on a candle and I said to him you know you can fit about a thousand bucks on a candle but after a hundred it starts getting heavy\nAnd um my relatives actually the Jimmy says oh I can see how that would happen and it was like okay [noise]\nAll right if you got kids and his family he or she certainly doesn't maybe needed smart watch but maybe you want to get them one because Brian and has a new what's called the gizmo watch as part of a bunch that offers for geo ... basically a virtual leash\nAnd it has the gizmo hub\nImpair it with an Iowa as Android device you
