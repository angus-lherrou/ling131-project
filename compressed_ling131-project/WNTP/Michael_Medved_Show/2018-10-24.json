I just said that you're you're listening to what ... are you saying or if you I did say that I said if you have a major in history you will have some required courses in history but general requirements\nWhat students or college years\nOkay you're you're ... or ... didn't let me be clear I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that I haven't been clear\nFor example you have to take the course of Columbia courses in Colombia in western civilization to get a degree if you majored in bought me or you majored in uh in German or you majored in physics you still have to take certain courses\nIn order to get a BA generally speaking those have been dropped that are where universities anyway I don't understand it so that's your strongman argument that's that's my ear generalization

I have a religious commitment the troops that was the reason people take me seriously and uh if it you know I Believe it at that\nI'm lying about their not being generalized requirements that most universities okay either he's right or wrong like you could all check it out\nSee what you have to take I don't mean at a major I said originally of course a mate\nTo require me you have a history

Frank [noise]\n\nSome things you\nSay everybody can sense stuff going on here in the county and let's go to David in Minneapolis Prager Hi David\nHi Dennis it's a pleasure to be on with you thank you\nI agree so uh but it's more interesting one I differ with you and I differ with you on a fire mental policy I think and I suspect that's what three minutes talking about when he uses the word science\nCorrect entirely actually about yeah well\nAnd so on that there are like three words in his\nSort of a phrase or one of them I happen to agree with him on which is I think my side Republican side is often in the science denying category when it comes to global warming right\nWe have a lot of videos on this given by scientists the oh I Know ... ... no matter what but it's important that you know that I mean Richard ... and was the dean of climatologists at MIT in the country\nAnd he takes issue with the proposition that the the there were three propositions to the global warming thing they collapse it into one of the world is getting warmer it is getting so much warmer it will lead to worldwide catastrophe it's not extinction\nAnd it is caused overwhelmingly by human beings no one is denying that the world was getting warmer I have not met anybody who denies that\nAnd they apparently are bombs they're rudimentary they're not highly sophisticated\nBut they apparently are operational and good for the NYPD and the FBI and the New York bombs\nWas basically an all the people who are trying to deal with this and do it also for some of the reactions not all of them some of the reactions have been appalling and hypocritical and wrong\nOr but not Steve ... says the various reactions that I've seen I think the one from the whip for the Republican Party in the house of representatives\nOf the honorable Steve Sebelius congressman from Louisiana who's been a friend of his show us Steve writes these attempted attacks that have been made or beyond criminal their acts of pure terror\nViolence and terror have no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society I've experienced firsthand the effects of political violence and I'm committed to using my voice to speak out against it where ever I can\nThose responsible for these evil acts of terror and yes even if no one has killed God willing known will be killed these are evil acts he writes those responsible for these evil acts of terror must be hunted down and brought to justice and I have great confidence that our law enforcement officers will succeed in that mission\nAs a nation we must agree that this is a dangerous path and cannot become the new normal\nExcellent that is fine and by the way what the president said he spoke after Milan yen millennia was promoting some of her causes any complimented his wife speaking as she introduced him he got a standing ovation\nAnd uh then the uh the president said this about the bombing attempts\nTo suspicious packages and devices meld to current and former high ranking government officials to safety of the American people is my highest an absolute priority\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being is affected by top explosive experts at a major federal investigation is now underway\nTo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expensive this effort [noise]\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\n[noise] what the\nPresident said is fine and it's appropriate and he offered a little bit more to be more specific here's President Trump\n[noise]\nIt's a very bipartisan state but I can tell you from both sides we both agree on that\nDisagree just conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans might administration will provide additional updates as they become available and I just want to thank everybody for their understanding [noise]\nWere extremely angry upset unhappy about what we went to this this morning and we will get to the bottom of it\nOK given the fact that two of the most prominent targets of these bombs\nWere Hillary Rodham Clinton who President Trump defeated and the election\nAnd the Democratic president that he replaced Brock Obama I think it would be helpful for the president or first Sarah Sanders frankly to reveal I mean enough revealed this honestly but I think it would be a good thing for President Trump to call President Obama and for President Trump to call Secretary Clinton\nAnd to express his concern and his gratitude that they and their families are okay\nBecause uh ... just saying that doing it would detoxify this entire matter and one of the things that I resent is mainstream media right now and a lot of democratic leaders\nAre injecting toxin into this situation\nThey're basically trying to blame Trump for this now I get it I understand most of the people who have been targeted or very clearly identified with the left their opponents of Trump\nThey include Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and Morocco bomb and yes all three of them are African American I understand that it also includes Hillary Rodham Clinton Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nAnd I'm I'm oh and George Soros she was the first one to receive a a package and apparently they are now saying\nThat the package was actually delivered in person by somewhat it was not mailed to George Soros but the package with this rudimentary bomb and it was delivered to Soros his home outside of New York city and um\n[noise] look at the idea that Trump is to blame\nFor this of course that is irresistible to the left and it seems to me it is entirely wrong\nI sent out a tweet about this immediately when that tendency started and I understand that there are people in the media who are trying to link together for phenomena what are the four phenomena these bombs the bomb scare\nNumber two the ... murder number three the fact that Trump ... as says that it's fake news as the enemy of the people\nAnd um and and a number for the uh the idea of the Trump praised at a rally in Montana\nThe body slamming a reporter by congressman Greg Gianforte by the way to apologize lavishly who paid the guy damages who apologized again and actually was pleaded guilty in court for assault and battery\nSo ah here's here's the point these four separate things Greg John forte the Trump\nAssaults on news media as fake news an enemy of the people the murder of the show veep and these bomb scares which are attempted murder\nWhat's the connection between all for nothing there is no connection the first two are evil threatening to murder people sending out bombs to people's homes that is evil murdering ... which no American had any role in at all\nWas evil and it's been denounced that way by the president the United states the other two things Trump's praise of Congressman John forte for the most embarrassing moment of his life\nAnd Trump's general ... on the news media is enemy that people it's stupid and it's been barrel saying it's not evil and it's not a crime and basically trying to associate these things is wrong it is irresponsible I Know it's irresistible\nFor people on the left especially Thirteen Days before an election but it's deeply irresponsible you want to hear about irresponsible Jack Reed the senator from Rhode Island was on uh CNN and of course CNN let him directly just saying what CNN wanted to hear listen\nI think is quite obvious to us as some of this is a reflection of the the base tone a debate and the president of the United states is that a rally and smiles as people chant lock her up or make their own direct attacks on the news media\nThat doesn't raise the level of debate that lowers it and it creates this environment where these acts could take place and not only being an attack I think the other thing that's going to have this or act that the found out is\nSomeone is sending as explosive device anonymously to people who could be heard and and this is something that is just just just to represent that\nIt's not just disreputable is not just caught cowardice is evil but the point is we don't know anything about the perpetrator yet I Hope we will soon\nAnd one of these guys are wrong let me give you an example of something else it was just a couple of days ago that in Washington DC in northwest Washington Fox five Fox News in other words was attacked\nBy a guy who have now identified his name was George ... and he came and he broke two big pains of glass and he came in and the security guards thank God shot him didn't kill him he's alive\nNow if all of a sudden you're attacking Fox News of course some idiot could jump to conclusions oh this was because of all the hospital things that Democrats have said about Fox News nobody said that\nBecause we didn't know anything about this guy now we do\nWhat do we know about him was he indeed a left wing activist actually know uh what was he we will get to that in just a moment we'll also get to some of the outrageous stuff that was set on NBC\nAnd something outrageous stuff that a leading Democrat said about the shooting of congressmen Steve's release so now you can't blame the less for that even though the guy who shot Steve's Phillies ended up dying was the Bernie Sanders volunteer we'll be right back on them adventure [noise]\nPresident Trump condemned the newsroom shooting and offered his condolences but he has often portrayed the news media is the enemy that people\nAfter the shooting the publisher of the New York times AJ shows burgers had in a statement that he told the president in private meetings that quote his language was nachos divisive but increasingly dangerous in other words what did they have to do with the newsroom shooting in Annapolis\nOr the attack on Fox News which is where this appeared in the paper\nOr this we don't know yet\nIt'll be interesting to find out we do know be on any shadow of a down\nThat wins Steve school lease was severely wounded and there was an attempt and and so we're Washington officers severely wounded assigned to protect the congressman and other attempts to kill other Republican congressman\nThat was politically motivated the guy was clear about it\nBut listen to what Nancy Pelosi said at the time when a and this is more than a year ago this is June of two thousand Seventeen right after Steve ... was shot she asked about uh some Republicans would condemn some of the hospital democratic rhetoric and here's what she said\nThey have or comments from Republicans including Congress about fishery all his rhetoric from the left being in some ways\nWell I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by my Republican colleagues are outrageous than eat the dignity of the job that they hold an eighth of dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command\nHad their they say such a thing how dare they so this sick individual that's something that the ball\nAnd it was horrible what he did hateful but for them to all of a sudden these sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before and I don't want to go into president of the United states but in terms of some of the language that he has you know again I let's go there another day it's like to ask\nHow could they possibly have such as\nFar as the way they have such a thing the way they could say such a thing is big clause that shooter had told other people that he had a grudge against Republicans he had been just active in the Bernie Sanders' campaign for president\nHe was deeply politically active and apparently mumbled to his wife all the time when he saw stuff on TV we know the guy was politically motivated\nSo the only kind of political motivation that can be condemned is if it is from the right well there are other people are saying oh this couldn't have been from the right this is probably a leftist set up can I say\nWe don't know when will we find out we'll get to that with your calls

everybody's head doll drop them off the intelligence community ethics waivers from Sunday getting back at you\nI don't remember saying exactly that but he said many many more things about President Trump go ahead so your ears thinking as the intelligence community that is set this up\nWho would be better at a polling off a scam or like this or a frame job like this without getting\nCaught okay well here's a problem or do you think the intelligence community wants to protect Trump or do you think they want to damage drop\nI think they want to damage\nAnd okay so out so you think that they damage Trump by sending a these a legend\nI'm bombs too and making sure that of course they don't explode I I think that's a better I guess a or a theory frankly I think there's\nEnough finalists

understand\nEven if God Forbid God Forbid the Democrats take control of the house and even if they voted to impeach President Trump he won't be removed from office impeachment probably would strengthen President Trump it really would and I don't want it to happen it would be incredibly bad for the country but look what happened with Bill Clinton\nHe rose his popularity the highest he ever achieved at precisely the time that the Republican House had voted impeachment and then they didn't even get a majority of Senate voters not even a majority\nTo vote to actually remove the president from office appreciate your call 'em and I think part of what you're saying\nIs at least it makes a little bit more sense than the idea that there was some democratic operative who did this if it is somebody who is connected with the intelligence community\nBut they should also be able to find that out with enough of the evidence they have run in Seattle you're on the ...\nYeah Michael lie about

found a bomb that had been delivered hand delivered\nTo the rather remote isolated outside New York city home of George Soros the billionaire democratic donor and\nPhilanthropist all over the world I mean I guess philanthropist will be a generous term but he's somebody who was funded a lot of left wing causes and by the way one thing about George Soros it it it tends to view him as a fountain of diluted evil\nHe does deserves some credit from Thirty years ago for helping to win the Cold War no really he helped to fund a pro democracy efforts\nIn some of the Eastern European countries and then even having having noted all of that George Soros gets these bombs and it's a kind of OK story\nBut all of a sudden you planted a bomb at CNN headquarters in the middle of New York city in the middle

building had the office of senator or one of the offices field offices that are common law hire us so that potentially could\nGo along with very prominent left wing targets and that would be the first person really who was identify more with the Bernie wing of the party then what's the very left mainstream of the party the Bernie weighing being left of left a one eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six he was the president of the United states speaking earlier today\nAnd if you have something that you find objectionable in what the president had to say give me a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nSuspicious packages and devices mail to current and former high ranking government officials to safety of the American people is my highest an absolute priority\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being inspected by top explosive experts at a major federal investigation is now underway\nTo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind to have no place in the United states of America [noise] people\nAre applauding and then I Know I Know I Know the monitor on the left if there was somebody a sitting here who is a congressional candidate and there isn't a from a the Democratic party what that shows you know we can never political violence but a at his rallies he ah encourage people to beat up\nSome of the protesters I think someone with President Trump said at his rallies during the campaign was stupid\nAnd it was irresponsible and he shouldn't have said those things but is it necessary for him now to go back there and say gee I'm Sorry I said these comments more than two years ago in the middle of a campaign it's not necessary for him to do that what has happened\nIs he is stomped encouraging violence and then somebody's going to say well the other night he was speaking in Montana\nAnd he congratulated a congressman Greg John forte for having body slammed a reporter or who um got on his nerves it wasn't even a reporter would have been particularly hostile to Congressman John forte\nLook I think it was a mistake I don't think he should have done that and handed the other side that kind of support\nBut the idea that that is somehow associated with somebody trying to kill people and whether\nOr not these bombs were very well made up it was an attempt to kill people or at least make people think that they were being threatened with death\nAnd it was outrageous\nAnd look there should be no problem at all with people acknowledge ing President Trump said something very good there he said we should condemn political violence of every time we should condemn scuffles we shouldn't condemn people and by the way it is part of what he very\nI'm perfectly and very poorly try to do in some of his garbled and messed up response to Charlottesville or when he said there are bad people on both sides what he said it was terrible as he said there are good people on both sides there weren't\nBut there were bad people on both sides and that was accurate and if he can go ahead and consistently now condemn people from groups from the Proud Boys to end chief uh from the neo Nazis to us some\nOf the other people on the extreme left who won't allow speech to proceed you know something I was just I just found out about ... and it's it's appalling to me because look I I have a certain affection for the physical a Yale University campus and I spent\nClose to seven years of my life there and right now the cameras been totally defaced by graffiti and all the graffiti is excerpts from the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford right\nOkay what is the point of that for goodness sake I guess the point is because Brett Kavanaugh went to college and the ... law school he was also there for seven years so now they have graffiti to remind people I mean really\nThat's pathetic\nAnd yes political violence and intolerance is pathetic whichever direction that comes from\nAnd I hear you have two members of Congress actually former members of Congress or David Jolly of Florida who by the way is very anti Trump and Steve Israel of above Florida who well surprise is very anti Trump here's how they sounded on MSNBC\nWe're in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president of United States\nAnd it's not just going to Montana and endorsing bodies slamming and it's not just saying that neo Nazis you know are good people or they're good people on both sides of a march including neo Nazis remember that the president item states in the campaign offered to pay the legal bills of his supporters are if they attacked his opponents\nAnd I'll just say one other thing I mean that's not even just the president we have a bomb squad and CNN or the CNN building in New York City today yesterday I was walking in New York City\nAnd I pass the the building where Fox News's headquartered\nAnd the ticker the digital ticker that displays news in that building\nWas reporting on the George Soros a bomb threat and it began with these words for the man who has everything that's not funny it is dangerous and so it's not just a president who gives a license to violence but those who are enabled by that violence they have a responsibility\nTo make sure that we are a embracing values of a piece of safety and not pouring gas on the planes will be happening too often\nI mean I'm Sorry how does how does I I don't know what the Fox take her actually said but if it said for the man who has everything\nIs he sure that that was in the context of George Soros I I don't know but it seems to me that if you are in the midst of a heated political campaign is very easy to say this rhetoric goes over the top or this is wrong or the president said you should beat up protesters who disrupt his rallies\nThat's different for murder\nIt is and it's different from condoning murder and the problem the refusal to make a distinction between things that some people on the right may say that are sometimes embarrassing and irresponsible and just\nPlain dumb that's very different from an action of attempted mass murder which is what we're dealing with here making distinctions is\nUtterly necessary if we're going to be serious in our politics we'll be right back there's a statement now from CNN [noise]\nBut equating that with the show the murder\nThat really you you want to show me that I'd love to hear from a prince Mohammed bin sell them on oh yeah President Trump told me it was okay I heard them attacking the lying stinking disgusting fake news media and I thought okay I'll do something and no of course he didn't think that he doesn't didn't\nAt first of all we don't even know Solomon a\nMom and then sell them on was actually directly responsibly probably was but the idea that he was somehow encouraged by Trump's ongoing fused with MSNBC and CNN\nIs ridiculous I Do hope\nThat when we emerged on the other end of the election day whatever happens and I hope urgently in earnestly that the Republicans prevail\nBut that we can move on from this this stupid back and forth on both sides it doesn't do the country any good to have voices in the media just perpetually blaming the president for everything and attacking him for everything\nWas a visceral hatred that I Do believe is unique it goes beyond anything that they applied to George W. Bush a Ronald Reagan or anyone else\nLet's um\nOr go to um [noise] Jonathan Berman who is an American news anchor and currently the co anchor CNN new day with Alice and come out on CNN he's a regular uh released presenter of Anderson Cooper three sixty this is what he had to say\n\nThat could have been sent to John Berman\nMeant to be because they said John Brennan on the packages had Brennan B. R. E. N. A. and\nI see okay so nobody knows who the package was sent it but if it was sent to John Brennan which is more likely than he's another politician not primarily a media figure um meanwhile\nUh the down is down sharply\nSays technology stocks led the market deeper into the red on week earnings reports from ... in Texas Instruments the NASDAQ last more than three percent that of course emphasize attack the Dow Jones industrial average is down [noise]\nMore than six hundred points at the moment [noise] um [noise]\nWell it's a moment the market's close [noise] ah\nAnother six hundred playing drawn [noise]\nIs that a response to ah [noise] once this I'm\nMad bomber did [noise]\nWhere do you think it's mad bombers plural we will get to that and the response on the caravan coming up [noise]\nUsed\nOrdinary maybe a I'm a news jogging nine Ninety dot com\n[noise] for news\nFor to get other big loss today on Wall street the Dow Jones industrial average off by six hundred and eight points was both twenty four thousand five hundred\nAnd eighty three the NASDAQ lost three hundred and thirty points the S. and P. five hundred or so a big loss of just about eighty five points by the closing bell effectively erasing it gains are so far for the year\nA lot of concerns about the trade dispute would try to show it to be behind that loss\nBen YPG cheaper counterterrorism says the explosive device to CNN headquarters in New York appear to be set by the same person who mailed pipe bombs to George ...

Democratic party in Congress both of them want to be majority leaders I and Thirteen Days from now\nWhen they we have a great big election uh also thirty six governors' on the ballot in that election is so important to be sure you vote\nHere's what Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had to say we listened with great interest of the president's remarks this afternoon we'll take an oath to support and defend the constitution and to protect the American people and that is our first responsibility\nHowever they say President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence\nTime and again the president is known physical violence and divided Americans with his words in his actions expressing support for the congressman who body slammed a reporter the neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never expressed support for killing a young woman in Charlottesville it's outrageous and it's wrong\nLook he was as that's outrageous charge and they have it right in their expressed his support\nFor the neo Nazis killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never did that expressing his supporters are his supporters at rallies who get violent with protesters dictators around the world who murder their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy that people\nLook at the the instinct here to play politics with a direct in serious threat ... would they still\nBe doing that if if one of these bombs going off and people were killed\nIt would be it would be even more outrageous and it is a now we we had a caller who um\nWho called and apparently she wanted to say should Trump tone down his rhetoric he should certainly avoid anything that can be construed as an endorsement of violence of any kind at the very least between now in the election and probably forever\nAnd yes he can be more careful there is nothing wrong\nAbout the asylum process and about a level of illegal immigration and it uh it it mentions that illegal immigration right now is at a forty year low the only\nYears where illegal immigration has been even lower than it is right now\nWhat are the last three years including last years of the Obama administration has been brought way way down and brought down by three quarters way greatly reduced part of it a bad economy part of it much better border security which began by the way under President Bush\nIn any event here's the interesting thing when uh people come here in terms of uh applying for asylum\nBetween the years two thousand twelve and two thousand Seventeen in other words including the Trump Administration\nImmigration judges turned back Seventy five percent of the people who came here from Guatemala seeking asylum\nSo she may say it's America's strength to be tolerant accepting but right now including under President Obama and yes under President Trump most people are coming looking for asylum or turn back\nAnd that it seems to me is reasonable it says the Trump Administration has made the process even more difficult by ordering immigration judges to stop granting asylum to virtually all those claiming to be victims of domestic violence a move that could block tens of thousands of people from gaining permanent entry into the U.S\nAnd in other words if you're running away from an abusive husband you probably don't have to run away two thousand miles to get to the United states and that seems to me is reasonable enough uh\nLet us go to your calls to John in Columbus ohio John you're on the Michael ...\nI'm Mike I'm yeah I I just find that you know

really perpetrating the father was I'm concerned but I'm ...\nThe the that the political people on the left side there that are lower than bottom feeder tactic of marrying President Trump and it is a lot of a ... he's pretty much kept this war he stayed on target these try but like you said nobody is perfect guy created nobody's perfect\nRight but the point is it don't you I I don't you think would be helpful if folks on our side than for instance chant lock her up lock her up um I mean again it's I I think the American people are kind of tired of that and that's OK maybe in the height of a campaign\nBut I don't think it helps our side and it's not a question that there's some kind of great huge moral outrage or this cross some line that's inscribed in the heavens\nIs just dumb politics because actually particularly the key deciding voters in a in this coming election are going to be white suburban women\nAnd I'm not sure the chance of a lock her up for anybody are going to

Hope it's not forever lost it doesn't look good do right now\nI agree with you and a look I\nI think if I'm a ... one of the things that that will be important is particularly if you look at some of the ads that the Democrats are running I mean some of them I've seen it down in Oregon where you have a good chance of electing a Republican governor and um and and here in in my state\nThe answers so hateful the most important thing is not to reward hateful miss don't rewarded\nOr you'll get more of it and when people say well you have to vote democratic to put some kind of check on President Trump selection isn't about President Trump is about Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer Trump status\nIs not going to change is going to continue as president the question is do those guys deserve a

of the pipe bomb that they you know and I don't even want to posted its its ugly and it's disgusting\nAnd are they are reporting the Jim Carrey is pending at least part of the blame for multiple explosive devices targeting Democrats and CNN on President Trump's he's not being part of the blame blame a plenty of blame it shows the bomb emerging from Trump smell Trump spoken the bomb came into existence\nGod's spoken light in the world came into existence so why not Trump ... create a pipe bomb in his mouth in any event uh he um ... the pipe bombs of course this this morning\nWe're targeting and by the way there is not is not true it is fake news that there was a pipe bomb targeting CNN\nThere was a pipe bomb targeting John Brennan now yesterday misspelled his name they spelled the B. R. E. N. A. and or just one and not to and but they addressed it to them care of CNN he also does by the way commentary on MSNBC he um\nHe he actually plays both sides of the pile on that one both so balanced CNN and MSNBC in other words that but MSNBC did not get a John Brennan package CNN did\nBut all of these packages seemed to be very directly and personally addressed two\nProminent figures on the American left bronco bomb Hillary Clinton former attorney general Eric Holder congresswoman Maxine Waters and yes ah also Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz now\nYou may have heard on this show and as I Know it can be a little bit confusing that the return address on these packages on all of them apparently was Debbie Wasserman Schultz no one believes that she's the one who sent bonds [laughter]\nUsually if you send a bomb you don't put your real address on it I mean and I know Debbie Wasserman Schultz who's an idiot she is but uh no she didn't do this ... I don't I don't think anyone is suspecting that congresswoman Wasserman Schultz did this\nWhat obviously was going on here is that this was the warped sense of humor or the evil and warped individual whoever it is who did this who figured oh great if they don't deliver this package and they return it then I'll get bent\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz and in trouble if even if I don't blow her I was a bomb that I sent her way um look all of this is is serious enough and I'm OK Debbie Wasserman Schultz today\nCondemned the packages sent this week with her turn and trash chef saying she is deeply disturbed that her name was attached to I I can imagine that I can sympathize with that\nPackages apparently can turning can painting explosives were sent on Wednesday to high level democratic leaders including former President Obama former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was Wasserman Schultz has all of us a name as the return address\nOne of those packages addressed former attorney general Eric Holder was returned to Wasserman Schultz his office because it was sent to the wrong address two of her Florida officers were evacuated and response she confirmed in a statement\nThe one time Democratic National committee chair she's been replaced by the indescribable fulltime Paris or she says in her statement we will not be intimidated by this attempted act of violence\nThe appalling attack on our democracy must be vigorously prosecuted and I am deeply disturbed by the way my name was used okay I think it it makes it fairly clear that um there are a lot of suspects on this and\nI Hope that by the time we're on the air tomorrow they will have identified a suspect they certainly should they should move as quickly and decisively as I possibly can\nBut a meanwhile there's all sorts of craziness Stacey Abrams is running for governor of Georgia\nAnd they're a series of issues that have arrested\nOne of them not that serious one of them it seems to me very serious and one of them it just seems to me is very very serious someone that wasn't that serious\nIs that on the former flag of the state of Georgia she engage while she was in college in a protest or in which the state flag knock the American flag the state flag\nBurned by cause it had the old Confederate battle flag in the flag they changed the state flag she has never been involved with burning other flags since then okay let that will go for a moment much more serious she has called for doing a Taliban on Stone Mountain\nWhich is a huge and and beautiful mountain in city park where it would cost literally hundreds of millions of dollars and it would be unsightly and destructive\nTo erase the work of art that was put up there in Nineteen thirty one is when they finished that they started putting it up and Nineteen fourteen and say three acres three acres of carved stone\nAnd she wants to blow it up\nI think it's perfectly appropriate if they put signage they're all around as saying that this image of Jefferson Davis and Robert de Leon Stonewall Jackson commemorates the cause\nThat we do not on our support and I think it's been very clear that the government of Georgia the government of the whole United States\nHas rejected the whole idea of the confederacy\nAnd the white supremacy that the confederacy was based upon very proudly very directly that's fine\nBut this idea there and they're even black leaders who have spoken out against Stacey Abrams radical position about basically blowing up and Dinah mining Stone Mountain is a Taliban position and it stinks\nAnd even worse was what you said last night now look I understand\nThe Democrats are trying to capitalize on this health care issue but you think the way to capitalize on the health care issue is to trash the entire free market system here is with Stacey Abrams the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia had to say last\nNight [laughter] higher here you are free market [noise] [laughter] [noise] remark so\n[laughter]\nI mean [noise] free market [noise] more than they do [noise] and they were to go [laughter] [noise]\nOkay the whole idea there is no profit and doing the right thing is entirely wrong\nBecause the very essence of the free market system the very essence of capitalism\nIs that you give people what they want and how do you know what they want is what they pay for and the notion that no one can make a profit doing the right thing that has only government that can provide for people\nIs utterly ludicrous and what she is saying here\nI Hope loses her the election I really really do because once you've suggested ... is that the free market system that we have to the extent that we even have a free market system any more than we do to a large extent you still have a lot of choice and your medical care\nAnd the idea that that is inappropriate when she says I've never seen the free market uh write a prescription in rural Georgia I'll bet there are people in rural Georgia who were ... listening to us right now\nWho have gone in and gotten prescriptions through the free market either because you have health insurance that covers it or because you pay for the prescription\nYourself and because it's made available at a local pharmacy now does that local pharmacy make profit by selling your prescription of course they do but you see that's the whole idea of a free market\nYou pay them rather than in slave in them\nAnd government forces a matter of and slaves ... this is the point that I'm Rand makes brilliantly is that basically to get people what you want to do you can either use money and pay them to do what you want them to do or you can use force\nThat that's basically it I Know of course you can persuade people to do what you want them to do and then you do something\nFor them in return but that's a free market transaction as well\nGovernment transactions are always by their very nature about force and the idea that someone is the Democratic party nominee in the state of Georgia\nWho believes that the the free market has to be rejected because you can't make a profit doing the right thing for goodness sake\nLook at the hospitals that we have right now most of which was fantastic job the development of drugs that we have there's actually something about the development of the drugs that we have [noise] through the free market\nThat is worth considering it involves a a a brand new movie as well we will get to that and your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nIt and you know the amount of time you you also think that that two thousand and one was there was not committed by foreign terrorists um\nOh yeah a a definitely think it was ...\nOr ... or so so what is our government has to do with that in other words my problem with us with with what you're saying we use I think\nIt's bigger than what everybody's looking at it as much burgers and in this small picture a pot bombs is much bigger and more confined to there's more people involved and and what you think\nWell I again if that's the case then I think they definitely are we'll figure it out I uh I I appreciate your\nCall but I I Hope that people will not\nBegin seeing your neighbors and your associates who may be completely wrong politically and disagree with you as definition really bad people because they disagree with you\nOn this I think\nPresident remember President Trump on all kinds of trouble for saying there would be good people on both sides in Charlottesville well they weren't the people on the Nazi site it was wrong about that but on the side between Democrats and Republicans yes there are good people on both sides\nCan we knowledge that\nLet's go to Greg in Seattle Greg you're on the Michael met that show\nHow's it going to go out of talk about that\nYou're a ... a gubernatorial candidate talking about all the free market healthcare right and she said that's just typical regrets on their side I mean really you know when you talk about the ... really what it is it's the it's the lack of free market the opaque pricing you can't just you know go\nProbably something out when one count or another for a better price I'm at\nThe other ... and ... because their first of all there's so many lawsuits and there's so many regulations in so much government interference and more than half of every dollar that we spend on health care right now passes through the government\nAnd the government takes it from people and then the government spends it so you're right we are very far from a free market system in any pure sense in a health care uh let says go go to Heather and little Heather you're on the Michael met that show\nA micro get attacked yeah thank you um I didn't have the last caller that came on mentioned that you got it made an inside job and you ask why would he play you know people who lived on the line or do we know yet that these bombs actually contained\nDetonate herbal material or were they\nDidn't do at is what what all the media sources are reporting that they were rudimentary but they were opera balls they were operational explosive devices they could have exploded it wasn't ...\nAnd uh again they probably would have done some attention was talcum powder to so if somebody just wanted to impact the politics enough to damage people they probably would have said something very different we'll be right back on the ...\n\nStory [noise]\nWith us\nOur News I'm Keith feeders in Washington President Trump is condemning a series of
