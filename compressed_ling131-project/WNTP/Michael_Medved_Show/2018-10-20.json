[noise]\nTook a picture of it and I posted it on Twitter and Facebook and somebody wrote and said very snorkeling [noise]\nThis is not your heritage\nAnd I rolled back in ... they link to a prominent ... Web site that's at twenty five percent of cowboys were black [noise]\nAnd I said so in fact it is my heritage [noise]\nAnd if you go on line you'll find that number twenty five percent I'm pretty calmly side it [noise]\nI contacted a friend of mine historian Roger McGrath who teaches are taught for a long time American West in California history and UCLA [noise]\nAnd um I asked\nHim about their twenty five percent number and he said there were a number of black cowboys many of whom were quite prominent\nI maybe about twenty percent of blacks were a on cattle drives in certain places but the number twenty five percent is wildly inflated and he said and I used to teach a course in this and when I talked about the number of being inflated I wasn't used to being racist\nSo I Would have talked to a Roger McGrath about the percentage of black cowboys how did the number to get to be twenty five percent how are they treated and I also want to ask him about this movie Django that I'm\nA Clinton parents you know put out and he said he wanted to create a huge role for black people as if they weren't already black cowboys I Want to ask a hit the historian whether or not the Django help to hurt the cause of historical accuracy about the American west all it will be coming up and just a few minutes\nBut first be um Reuters is reporting that a Russian had been charged with conspiring to interfere in us congressional elections\nAnd a arena or can't pronounce the last name become the first person charged with a crime for interfering with twenty Eighteen elections sheep accounting for something called project lack a operation started and twenty fourteen funded by Russian oligarch\nAnd um this Russian oligarch and to other companies were indicted or back in February and special counsel Robert Mueller separate investigation of alleged Russian meddling\nTo complain details new examples of Russians using fake persona is on social media to stoke arguments about race and other contentious issues\nNow I had written and talked about how USA Today looked at all of the uh Facebook ads that the Russian box purchased a and a the overwhelming majority of them had to do with race\nAnd sometimes they were pro black sometimes they were anti black only a handful had to do with specific mentions of Hillary or I'm Donald Trump basically they were just trying to sow racial discourse\n[noise] now how can something like this actually have an impact on election it could have an impact on the election a given the fact that the left constantly talks about how racist America yes the Russians are watching the same news at\nUh everybody else watches they watching this and be are they watch CNN they see this constant constant constant drumbeat America just to show the racist systemically racist black lives matter you ought to block cetera\nMy point is whom do you think has a bigger impact on how people think and how people vote Russian box on the left wing media that constantly talks about racism or sexism income inequality homophobia\nMy friend Tim grows close to what I wrote a book called left turn\nSaid that of the primary news sources between eighty Ninety percent of them are left wing and if the news media were truly fair and balanced the average state would vote the way Texas does which is about eight to ten point in favor of a Republican so if you want to look at impact on election\nLook in the mirror mainstream media because you have a far bigger impact\n\nAnd even if you argue that the media point of view or is it legitimate point of view\nNinety percent\nHow's that balanced how was the answer is it's not\nFar far more impact during the two thousand eight election you've got people like\nThose who are in that organization called journalists reporters literally going back and forth on line discussing wave we could minimize the impact of the revelation of Jeremiah Wright uh on the Obama campaign\nHere here's what we can do we can pick any conservative let's find somebody Karl Rove Fred ...
