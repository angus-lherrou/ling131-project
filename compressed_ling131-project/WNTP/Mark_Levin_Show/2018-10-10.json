this in this country the voters though they know that this is a non nothing burger and so I'm going to continue going forward just speaking the truth uh but I'm not going to be derailed by these fake controversies\nNow here's an article by a man named Matthew Chapman don't know who he is headlined GOP candidate wrote a book arguing the founding fathers were right not to abolish slavery\nAnd he's talking about Ron decide is Iran descended wrote a book called green from our founding fathers first principles in the age of Obama enough to take off from Obama's book dreams from my father\nQuote one of the most disturbing claims he made in the book was that Thurgood Marshall the first African American Supreme Court justice was wrong to suggest the founding fathers failure to abolish slavery in the constitution was a fundamental flaw\n[noise] if the standard is simply left it at tolerating slavery was a central to get the southern states on board she might have had a point\nBut the claim that the constitution somehow pre ordained at the end of slavery ever written is pure whitewashing given that it took a bloody civil war\nTo do so [noise] and he talks about the three fifths deal that was made between the north in the south\nAnd how reprehensible that deal was another person who appears to be pretty ignorant about history\nHere's an article by Walter Williams called slavery quote\nThe time of the Seventeen eighty seven\nConstitutional convention slaves were about forty percent of the population of some southern colonies\nHe talks about how the southerners want it to ... count east late as one person in order to increase their representation in the north because they want it to limit the power of a slave holding ... states wanted them not to count them at all till they agreed on telling them as three fifths as a compromise\nQuote many criticize writes Walter Williams this compromise as proof of racism which is what this guy said about Rhonda Sanders [noise]\nMy question to these grossly uninformed critics is whether they would have found it more preferable for slaves to be counted as whole person's slave counted this whole person would have given slave holding southern states much more political power\nOr which critics of the founders prefer that the northern delegates not compromise and not allow slaves to be counted at all if they did it is likely that the constitution would not have been ratified\nThat's the question the emerges whether blacks would have been better off with northern states having gone their way and southern states having gone there's resulting in no U.S Constitution and no union\nAnd then Walter Williams quote Patrick Henry who set of this three fifths compromise quote as much as I deplore slavery I see that prudence forbids its abolition into quote\nOne of the delegates Jane well streams Wilson said this about the compromise\nOh Denice recalling a let's let's revisit\nThe last eight years do you have a president who gave a addressed the United nations and vote for ... which is a complete bogus thing\nHe didn't have his hands up didn't say don't shoot but a President Obama a thought it fit to talk about America flaws and suggested that Fergus him with a microcosm of it\nObama's attorney general Eric Holder said when it comes to matters of race America has been a nation of cowards close quote\nAnd he said that there were a America right now or is involved in pernicious racism gay three examples says the push for voting rights was a first for for a photo of voter id was an example of pernicious racism never mind the majority of blacks want\nPhoto voter id\nPete instead or as another example the pernicious racism the fact that black boys are expelled or suspended from schools at a greater percentage than the other kids in that particular school ... a a Jesse Jackson even food an all white school board in Decatur, Illinois for cutting out a bunch of black kids were fighting after football game the argued that the all white\nUm school board\nWas racist a and that the policy that was applied to these black boys was racist\nDecatur defended himself by pointing out all around the country where the school board is all white or school board are conducting a poll people of color close call back black boys are still kicked out disproportionately compared to other uh boys at that given given school why because they're misbehaving\nThe third example that a Eric Holder gays as an example of pernicious racism or is the fact that they black\nCriminal defendant who commit to same crime as a white criminal defendant gets a longer sentence and that is true what Eric Holder didn't tell you is that the U.S and the commission or that came up with that with that that also said the reason is for is the fact that judges\nOr when it comes to sentencing will take into consideration you defend this arrest record and it turns out the typical black the Senate has a longer arrest record than typical white defend it as a result that black defend it gets a longer sentence nothing to do with racism or the U.S sentencing commission says that the judges are taking into consideration\nLegitimate factors\nThat's all you got Eric Holder is all you got [noise] and if I had a son he'd look like Trayvon remember that [noise]\nObama brought in some of the black lives

Merrick Garland a is something they see is that as having kicked off a new stage in the partisanship associated with the Supreme Court nominees\nBut I don't know much history you have to go back to Eighteen eighty to find the last time\nA Senate controlled by a different party\nFrom the president confirmed a Supreme Court justice to a vacancy created in the middle of a presidential election they also conveniently forgotten the Joe Biden said and I think Ninety two when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee Democrats control the Senate Republican in the White House\nIf a vacancy occurred they wouldn't fill it also conveniently forgot that Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid Eighteen months before the end of Bush forty three set up a Supreme Court vacancy occurred they wouldn't fill it\nWith all of either ... bright but Mr later I don't think that's right and Nineteen fifty six Eisenhower nominated Brennan and data for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the biting rule job I was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked and he said to\nNot have the nomination come up before the election but that it couldn't come up after the election and so a Democrat\nSay when they hear you're doing this as they say he's creating new rules to do what he wants to do and as you've written in your book the long game when you do that it actually hurts democracy\nYeah well that's not exactly a thought at all what happens ... completely misconstrue and whatnot but what I got to be with the history of this I Know the history of this I've spent a lot

you're wrong because the Democrats approved an election year Supreme Court nominee in Nineteen fifty six John King of CNN\nThey also conveniently forgotten the Joe Biden said and I think Ninety two when he was chair of the Judiciary Committee Democrats control is a Republican in the White House it was back in the uk or they wouldn't fill it\nI don't think that's right and I think fifty six Eisenhower nominated Brennan the data for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the biting rule Joe Biden was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked\nAnd I thought at all what happened John you're completely misconstrue and whatever\nI'm a college right on the history of Eisenhower gave a recess appointment in Nineteen fifty six the formal nomination\nFor that is that it didn't happen until after the presidential election year than McConnell they try to do that [noise] Siberian presidential election year we had a Republican president

I'm sixty years uh my husband being one of the two ah Lyndon Johnson being the other\nLet's hear that one more time since Donald Trump of course is a liar and\nAs only then won twice in the last ... years my husband being one of the two uh Lyndon Johnson being the other [noise]\nOkay now according to the rubber Center for public opinion which is based in ... at Cornell\nWhen Bill Clinton ran in Nineteen Ninety two\nHe got thirty nine percent of the white vote George Herbert Walker Bush got forty one percent and Ross Perot got Twenty one percent when Bill Clinton ran for reelection in Nineteen Ninety six he got forty four percent of the white vote according to the rover center Bob Dole got forty six percent\nAnd Ross Perot got nine percent so let's let's hear that again and of course the person a tomb she thought too busy interview worked either it's foolish or didn't want to correct her\nVote has only then won twice go back further\nCandidate for a decade now or the white vote has only been one twice in the last few years uh my husband being one of the two ah Lyndon Johnson being the other\n[noise]\nWhere do you mean to say\nThe bigger problem of course is the person who she was interviewing with who didn't say jak\nExcuse me a no your husband didn't not even close thirty thirty nine percent in Nineteen Ninety two forty four percent in Ninety six\nNo George Herbert Walker Bush when a greater percentage of the white vote than your husband did in Nineteen Ninety two and Bob Dole won a greater percentage of the white folks and your husband did in Nineteen Ninety six you were wrong and of course you weren't corrected Heidi Heitkamp says she decided to vote against Kavanaugh because of his body language\nAnd you were obviously yes vote on on Capitol then switched to your vote to know after you ... testimony understand with the sound off I found that really interesting I'm Wondering can you explain what you saw with the sound off but that they do change your mind\nWell I think first off it's it's important to know that I watched that that in its entirety I watched her testimony I watch their testimony I lift and and and I did you watch heard with the sound down clean kill the point of this hearing\nUm I was preparing a statement saying I was going to be a yes I watch the hearing and during the process of listening I thought this is a this is um ... you know we expect someone to have decorum we expect someone to have a judicial temperament\nAnd what I thought I thought was maybe tainted by what I heard and so I turned off the phone and watched it with the sound off just as opening comment\nAnd um what I saw was\nSomeone who I'm with angry someone with aggressive someone who really um I think a challenge to everyone in the room and and you can understand that and appreciate that I mean of course he was going to be angry\nBut I think there is a way to express that anger and in ways that maybe I'm a can communicate anger but [noise] but [noise] maintain\nJudicial point what people ate and I'd say one F a GED I'm Larry Larry Elder all through all the [noise]\nThe white vote only been one twice now last year last sixty years\nMy husband being one of the two\nAnd now he was not one of the two charm so that's all I'm Talking about she was just wrong about that\nOkay I accept that except for one thing he did say before that a white women have been already or a Republican or a decade I mean again I Would like if she was or white or as white\nWell Shawn you're being awfully generous I Would like that people give the same kind of flexibility to things that Trump says Trump is a very imprecise speaker he says something he gets pounded and I want people to go well what he meant was this what he meant was that I think it's fair\nHe gets pounded for what he said about Charlottesville ... they're good people on both sides he wasn't saying they're good Nazis on both sides good fascist on both side good white supremacist on both sides he was talking about the argument about whether or not the Confederate statues memorials ought to be in the public square there are good people on both sides and argue my mother and father didn't think they should be removed\nThat what you're talking about so we're going to hold 'em or Donald Trump to be very precise and if you said something that's imprecise and you've been interpreted the worst possible way why can't I Do that with Hillary\nWell here we met was a white woman that's not what she said she was very very specific she said the Democrats have not won the white vote in last sixty or do I need to do that again\nLike when all women went for me and [noise]\nLook white women have been a voting against democratic presidential candidate for a decade now or the white votes has only been one twice in the last ... years my husband being one of the two\nOkay so she just dead wrong now I Want to\nTalk real quickly about Derek Lewis Derek Lewis is that a U.S the fighter that won his fight in a thunderous knock down\nThe pike Donald Trump called the ...\nAnd he said if you are the for the fight Donald Trump called him and told the now the guy he was fighting is a Russian\n\n[noise] see how much the feet\nIn the tank and if he can rally here down the stretch [noise]\n\nThat Donald Trump called it's all around the world some\nMaking very little
