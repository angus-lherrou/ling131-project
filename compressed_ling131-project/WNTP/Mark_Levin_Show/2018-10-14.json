I mean they're their own identity and their social engineering this in some house thinking that whatever they do have causal effect\nBut the causal effect that they are they're doing is they're actually are putting a stick and the economics posted this country\nThat's exactly what it is you know when you hear candidates are you here you know greater than fifty percent of Democrats believe socialism is is preferable to capitalism a you know you kind of have to think you know what's what's going on here and and if they do take control of the house you know what kind of\nThings are going to try to push through a you know that are going to be the antithesis of a good for the economy you know the exact opposite of what we need you know they're exactly\nDoing exactly that you know when you have a front front leading candidate you know\nA ran for president last election cycle and Bernie Sanders who wants to you know for a spin trillion trillion and trillions of dollars for a single payer health care plan and now you have a an emerging millennial and caused so Cortez a who's looking\nTo spend thirty trillion dollars or more I think the numbers more than that right exact ought to get this plan in place you know you had to think these this is the next wave of Democrats I don't know that we're facing too great of a threat and twenty twenty\nYeah I go back to the you know the basics Chris and I've been asking this question forever is that\nYou know um how much government do we want to buy how much government can we afford and here we are still trying to you know swallow down a three four trillion dollar size government and the socialist ideas that oh no that's [laughter] no\nI mean we're barely keeping up with that we got twenty two trillion dollars in debt staring is in our face and uh you know and they go oh we got a better idea let's expand Medicare even more so we're going to go back and\nRevisit Obamacare two point oh I'm In you know and and this is what the Democrats think it's just not quite never enough if you just gave us a little bit more\nUh we can figure this out and it's like look at we can't afford it we've already giving you a everything we can give you and it's not working you know when do you cut your losses and move on\nWell you know that that racket right I mean the whole racket\nFor Democrats and when they run for office that they promised free stuff it's very simple you know I said earlier or you know an economic terms just\nPrint money and you know kind of give it away and you know lower interest rates make it easier to borrow but you know you have to have a healthy economy you have to do it the old fashioned way will operate and domestic economy anymore we ... we operate in a global economy and so\nYou know that's the whole racket they they've been running uninformed an educated voters think great gimme gimme gimme gimme more\nGovernment will take care of me government will pay for my bills I don't have to worry about anything and I have to worry about\nYou know anything that you know that I should do to improve my own\nA market ability as a as a worker or even as a business owner or the government will just take care of me Uncle Sam would just take care of me and that is the exact opposite of what we were founded as a nation of you know we're a capitalist free market economy were competition is good healthy it makes products better it tries prices down\nYou know it it makes everybody all it makes everybody better off that's why millions of people uh you know hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty because of the free market system that Republicans espouse\nIncrease this secures aren't liberty\nI mean this is this is what drives all this I mean the reason that people want to come to this country is to really be free\nYou know to allow their ideas and their dreams to be ... in this country of Ford's than that and uh you know every time the Democrats are in leadership I mean all you gotta do is just look at the city's look at the states where ... where Democrats\nAre involved in their leading the way I mean it is absolute misery for the citizens there for the most part\nAnd you know it's like a you know what the voters can't figure this out even and you know let's say California you know was the pain that they're under I mean here it is\nUm you know you've got a governor talking about supposedly this robust growth that they've been having well they're still at a net negative they chased away more businesses out of that state and more jobs out of that state but yet you know with a straight face the governor says oh we've you know we've added so many new businesses\nYou know to the state here is like wait a minute you know you're so you're so far behind that you know we need that\nAnd then some in order to get back to ...\nAnd that's exactly it it it's kind of the same terminology bill as when they say uh you know during the Obama administration how many jobs\nNow how many jobs they created how many jobs they have created and I understand it but it's not an economic metric you should be proud of how many jobs you've saved or created it should be how many jobs they created it reminds me when I came into the\nTrump Administration at the department of commerce and I ran the minority business development see some of the metrics that we had help minority businesses okay how many businesses have we have we helped\nOr how much that we said to them and getting contracts with the dollar amount and then I came in and I looked at this this new metric and it said how many jobs were created\nOr save [laughter] we're getting rid of that that is part of and can we create and I'll tell you during the twenty\nOr twenty uh Eighteen fiscal year we created ten thousand new jobs with that small agency or just a just a small budget\nAnd it's because of President Trump's a robust economic plan and and the domestic policies that exactly the business owners frankly the opportunity to just give them the ball you know you have all the end zone\nAnd we got to go to break when you pick it up there we get more from crisscrossing after they're staying with us\nNever wonder how bitcoin and the theory him were created\nPersonal media hundreds of companies and individuals makes her home was doing was munching

June ... September ...\nUh looks like they're going to do it a given December so that means the memories of marriage or a month\nJust for you can't raise the rates going into Christmas can you tell them I Will I guess they can never they were in wide rise\nThat will be for interest rate increases the fear that means that once you pay on credit cards as student loans and car loans and business loans all that's gone up three times this year will go up four times probably three times at least next year so it's costing consumers more money tomorrow when they're trying to ...\nSorry to have an impact of seeing the housing market definitely getting weaker than it was before\nWith mortgage rates going up to over five percent how does that help because well I mean in the ... view they kept interest rates too low for too long\nAnd their so called normalizing of getting back to normal rates now they're fed funds rate that they control the two and a quarter\nI think what they would consider the neutral rate is maybe three and a half percent so another point or more from where we are now which means that you're going to be even more on a loan you know going forward I mean it helps the fed it helps us particularly definitely slows the economy\nAnd particularly bondholders are really getting hurt here you know I mean if you have money in a long term treasury bonds and the yield keeps going up as\nIt has been you lose more than principled anywhere in an interest if you're getting three point two percent on on long term bond today and ready to go to say three and a half percent which I think it's likely I I think you could lose a lot of principle so you got to do something different because right keeping it that way you're going to keep losing money\nWell the reality is is the fed is the fed and I know that when these things can happen when the dynamic tension starts\nPulling a little bit more in their direction people start saying why we have the fed anyway\nUh they're really not helping the cause specially at a time when\nWe're we're trying to recover ourselves the everyday consumer uh for eight years of bad news real bad news and bad experiences and of course uh you know they feathered that whole situation by not raising rates are all those number of years so I guess we're we're paying for the feds past sins I get\nExactly that's a good way to put up the fed felt that they were too easy they pumped\nA ... the ... friends balancing it was about six hundred billion dollars before the financial crisis and after about four and a half trillion so they've pumped about four trillion dollars into the economy\nTo keep it from kind of going over the edge and now we're paying about their kind of reducing that a bit mhm so if we can't just supposed to talk about what people should do if they've got money is going to get hurt 'cause\nIt's it's not a pretty situation I mentioned before the most popular even though I get free Webster's about these secured real estate

Thomas\n[noise] [noise] hello Hi welcome what's going on but well the\nQuestion I had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that would function something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise] ah\nSo you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver as that what's happening\nIs that part of it yeah or I I end up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go\nTo live there an easier way to do that I have been an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday so I thought it would be cool to make a little look at the end of the summer the said\nHere's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday perfect\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in text it ended up being thirty five pages long about chipped keys to sixty photos but there was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could have helped me do that that are\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now there it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nAh there are sites like ours that will do round up some say you know here at ten grapes photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nOr how you see if you're looking for a particular after you can always read the reviews people are brutally honest\nAbout what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew or you use a particular site to put together a photo but did you not yeah we used to fly you shutter flies\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that it you know these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be in one of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book do yes\nAnd we got it and 'cause I ... a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word man called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and\nNo charge and so you so before you look for a particular app\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it is John right out of work with work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that done\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you've created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they we communicated back and forth on fiber they ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to ... to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so in the next time you have a task putting in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh caller\nOkay okay okay I mean that's why we're here and

item that current across my desk and screen that you need to know about first to which\nThe state of California is banning weak passwords that's right\nIt's a new law the state of California you know all those Internet connected devices all around your home you have cameras in thermostats and routers garage doors the smart light bulbs the smart crock pot for some reason well most of them come with these ridiculously easy to crack\nPasswords for example many routers and webcam default admin password like admitting her password so the idea that when you set up your new gadget you should always change that if all pass for\nMe to get something strong that there's cameras won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people will just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers and cameras arid so lawmakers in California you're trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty it makes it illegal for companies\nJust said week default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made in the state\nThe problem is that in flux to those Internet connected device that just mentioned they're made in China\nSo the new law is going to require manufacturers who said complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe come up with a startup procedure in place it forces the user\nTo change the password I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean but how effective is really going to be ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nOr a Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced a whole slew new pixel phones or because they had a major security breach\nWell they said it was a bug well that's what they always say it's a bug actually nobody was paying attention they expose the private information of about a half a million people for about three years thank you Google Google has its own social media site called Google Plus they announce between twenty Fifteen and march with twenty Eighteen\nKnown was paying attention a security flaw as they like to say well if the personal information of five hundred thousand people up for grabs email addresses gender occupation you get the draft\nSo four hundred and thirty different applications had access to that data\nGoogle says they are going to shut Google Plus damn using only use it anyway but that doesn't mean anything your data was up for grabs what happened to that Google slogan anyway you remember they would walk around and said don't be evil ah that's right and they stopped using that slogan earlier this year ...\n[noise] I write if you're traveling you really need to have Google Translate on your phone or your tablet they had a major update this past week in hours with four of the ten most spoken languages on planet or if you've never used the app you point your camera at a diner menu and you watch the translate the text in real time\nOr this is really cool you take a picture and then you let the ... process the translator will text for you\nSo now they have Arabic and Hindu a Bengali Punjabi as four of the ten most spoken language in the world and ... ... ... ... to ...\nThai Vietnamese and of course English and yes I just miss pronounced all of them but you get the point they've got a lot of languages on board [noise]\nOr I moving along why by a thousand dollar or a Fifteen hundred dollars smartphone when you can build your own right think about this\nIf you've ever wondered what's inside a cell phone there's new kick it called make her phone it's eighty nine bucks are cool gives you everything you need to make a phone\nAll right it's not going to be an iPhone and send me something from Google but it works and it even comes with the space invaders game yes they say make her phone is going to take it from learning how to weld\nAre using is soldering iron and then when your very own fully functional phone all the way down to coating your own app or game\nAnd so basically you get all the parts tutorials that you need you need to have your own soldering iron pliers and screwdriver although they're gonna teach you had a thought or to even learn how to code and using scratch micro python or do we know which is actually based on the er C. plus plus\nSo if your kids want to phone for Christmas to get them one of these is going to take them a while to build it they don't they works they have a phone if it doesn't work they need to find out what's wrong with it and that should keep them out of circulation for a long time\nI read finally here's another reason why you need an Amazon Echo analytics in your life I think back to the very last time that you had your

you've ever been with that person the can reminisce\nAnd now based on all of that election is kind of figure out that you're depressed and delivered Zoloft right to your front door his technology grant [laughter]\nThat's right Amazon is patented this technology that would allow Alexa unless your voice to determine whether or not you're sick depressed sad and intellectuals going into your product based on your emotional condition\nAnd because Alex's always listening here's what Amazon says a cough or a student for crying may indicate that the user has a specific physical or emotional

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nI don't\nHim in the face of from Congress people\nSo that was a GOP ad that was just put out that is absolutely one hundred percent accurate\nSo what are the less doing here what is the Democrat Party doing here because it's clear that they are doing this deliberately\nThe left and we'd been planning this out for very long time is there an echo chamber the repeat themselves they flock this they have different tactics that they use and then it looks like they all come out and they say almost the same thing\nThen you see it also heard it on MSNBC you see on CNN [noise]\nThis is first of all the very dangerous and second is also very desperate is very clear that the Democratic party after first trying to de legitimize Donald Trump before he even came into office failed\nTried to take away his the electoral college I'm as a left or as didn't happen\nThen they deployed the whole a fake dot CA\nAnd you wait until the second hour Oakland A's radio show because I\nHave a huge exclusive interview by a witness to Trump Tower you'll hear what I mean in just a few minutes but that didn't work either\nThey understand and with the economy booming right now with jobs a record rate with the GDP at a record rate the Democrats look at me possibly do what is the argument\nOne by one Donald Trump is dismantling the entire progressive is to an agenda all of broccoli Obama's failures that he enacted one by one Donald Trump is dismantling and\nThe Democrats have absolutely no response because America is coming back were winning the economy is coming back jobs are coming back were being respected again internationally domestically patriotism is on the rise and so when this happens that\nIs what the democratic\nParty resorts which is the age old ... strategy of trying to fool as many people as you can ah\nBecause you can fool some of the people some of the time and ... race warfare and class warfare and resistance for the sake of resistance but again resist what\nIt's just like all of this impeachment talking they're serious they are going to try if the Democrats take the house they're going to try to impeach Trump but for what\nWhat did he do duty colluded with Russia no while Hillary Clinton did\nWhile the Democratic National Committee did or at least colluded to smear Donald Trump with this fake Russia propaganda\nImpeach him for a while but that is there a strategy here and to me this is why I've been focusing and if you miss my show last week check out the podcast connect dot com slash or incline on the deliberate move to the radical left of the mainstream of the Democratic party\nPeople like right here in New York ground zero for this is Kirsten Gillibrand who's long been basically a moderate Republican Democrat in the beginning and now she's openly oriented herself toward the far left\nThe Bernie Sanders crowd hanging out with windows source or\nGoing to radical demonstrations turning against Israel which goes hand in hand with turning against the United states of America and patriotism and the fact that she does this and she believes that this is going to position herself for twenty twenty just goes to show you where the Democratic party is\nFirst of all I Want to take your phone closing the lead on this ... seven seven nine seven zero to nine nine nine on this of course I mean on the the Democrat\nMobs that George Soros funded mobs on the streets of the United states and the way that the highest levels now of the Democratic party are calling for borderline violence\nKick somebody we cannot be civil and you heard push back on them by Maxine Waters what the heck do you think she means by that of course we know exactly what she means\nWhy is the Democratic party deliberately sending out these signals that go beyond protest beyond resistance there cannot be any question\nThat they have crossed the line into inciting violence\nAnd so therefore the the second question of course becomes what happened is if you're caught in a Democrat mob violence [noise] eight seven seven nine seven zero to nine nine ...\n\nWhat do you think is the Democrats and game here in inciting violence now against Republicans and against national going against Trump supporters\nNow I Know what is exactly precisely when the entire argument is turning against the Democratic party and win so transparently they are bombs and they are being work history it in from the top or directed or at the very least encourage\nAll of a sudden entered Gavin get us to I have long had concerns about and then you had this breakout quote unquote of some fist fights on the streets in Oregon over the weekend and then if you look at it we're talking about here like this band of maybe twelve people\nUm and clearly McGinnis and is Proud Boys\nHas ... let's just say the trend toward very dangerous ideology and they don't at all represent\nA Trump supporters are the Tea Party movement this stuff is actually pretty crazy and then you had like a handful of fist fights on the streets of Oregon and then if you look at how many people were there\nAnd they were more reporters and more people they're just taking photographs than the twelve white men are there's little Proud Boys that got into that fist fight\nAnd then apparently similarly other mic and ask people on a with him president in New York City also instigated some violence on the streets of New York and just like in Oregon we're talking here about like ten twelve people and then the whole media now focuses on that while we have the throngs\nOut on the Democratic party and we saw them in full force against Kavanaugh and they're being encouraged openly by the Democratic party there is no comparison whatsoever so I notice that that's very interesting that it was happening\nBut all of this strategy in which the Democratic party has turned to mob rule has turned to an incitement to violence clearly they are aiming toward the midterms\nAnd that is why we cannot let them get away with that and that is why everybody listening right now no matter where you are you haven't got to get out and vote for them in terms of less than a four weeks and actually we hear on this radio show I'm going to be focusing heavily\nIn the coming weeks with more candidates coming on this radio show and you heard last week we focused on New York with the senatorial candidate here shell formerly a and one of the congressional candidates I'm going to continue full speed ahead with that are in the next few weeks on the show\nNow as I said just so you know what's coming up in the second how're\nYou ... if you've been following my reporting you know that I've been focusing on Rob Goldstone and something called the Trump Tower meeting with the infamous meeting in which\nThe Russians from fusion GPS are highly connected to fusion GPS show up at this meeting at Trump Tower for twenty minutes to meetings about nothing the campaigns totally an interest in it and then that twenty minute meeting has been used time and time again as evidence quote unquote by the media\nClaiming some sort of collusion with Russia as if\nAt first of all the Trump campaign let's just say they were looking to colluded with Russia which is insane with it and so like they would do it inside their headquarters in full view of everybody but colluding plenty minutes to steal an election really in so transparently ridiculous\nBut I've been focusing on Trump Tower for another reason\nIs because Trump Tower shows in fact the fingerprints are all over that the Russia collusion conspiracy was set up it seems by Hillary by the DNC how is it possible that these people who show up at Trump Tower the day before the day of the ad\nThe day after having dinner with fusion GPS which of course put out the fake news dot CA\nHow is it possible that the Russian lobbyists takes me trained that morning with the Hillary associate meets with them before the dinner at the meeting with them after Trump Tower and nobody notices and then he's the guy who passes the ... McCain\nIs Oscar Lopez Rivera that's the Puerto Rican communist terrorists to spend your thirty five years in prison for bombings\nHe's coming to speak at Hofstra University so what are the students or kids or or the young young Americans and whoever go to these colleges they're indoctrinated by people who are terrorists and then decided\nOh by the way it don't forget bill airs hello bill airs was a terrorist ... was the guy who boasted about bombing the Pentagon a bombing or trying to bomb the police headquarters and then he goes underground and comes out because he's part he by the way the FBI screwed it up he was never found innocent he was guilty\nHe comes out and what does he do he gets into education does anybody think that it's a coincidence that the weather underground was flooding the murder of Seventy five million Americans according to you\nOr the FBI informant that he then comes out and then to continue his radical revolution what does he do\nHe found was a it was called the small schools workshop with another radical and then gets government funding by the way so it education is key here but then we kind of again sort of just like when these\nDemocrats would go and if I\nGo on the solidarity visits with radical countries we kind of set in okay it's weird but what can we say oh we also kind of didn't pay attention to this dangerous mentality\nInside the universities so now it has gone from the universities and no mistake about it with people like Bill heirs\nTo the streets of America and to the top leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd their disciples people that were indoctrinated by these communist are now advisors and age two congressmen and senators they're teaching other people there riding the textbooks for the teachers schools\nThere in our mosques here in our churches there and synagogues these people are sprinkled out they're spread out there and send you waited and infiltrated throughout society so this they're pushing for the peaceful transition to world socialism and now they're getting a little bit more radical\nI Believe they were aiming for the hundredth anniversary of the Soviet revolution I mean these people are claiming Trump colluded with Russia celebrated the hundredth anniversary of the Soviet revolution and they recently celebrated the two hundred ... they're called marks\nSo yeah and by the way they are loaded with the Institute for policy studies Obama's or a Obama's White House ... is this ... different legislation with the center for American Progress in coordination with the Marxist or\nInstitute for policy studies that was identified as a communist front group you couldn't make that stuff up or Jimmy in Brooklyn thank you so much an eye on the phone number here as it seven seven nine seven zero to nine nine nine ah I'm thinking this whole new way of\nMadness isn't ... is actually fake news lots are a lot of changing right now what do you think there's going to happen\nIn the midterms eight seven seven nine seven zero to nine nine\n[noise] with\nA syringe news on board and driven to leading Senate Republicans are threatening top punitive action by Congress against Saudi Arabia including a possible hauled a military sales if it's proof that Saudi journalist ... was killed inside the country's consulate in Istanbul Saudi Arabia warning of possible economic\nRetaliation of its own if the u._s. acts\nThe European Union's top breakfast negotiator says urgent talks with Britain's point person did not result in their reaching agreements on outstanding issues you negotiator Michael Barnett says despite intense effort some key issues are\nWell open in the divorce talks between the European Union and Britain exit polls indicate German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative allies are losing their absolute majority in the various say parliament by a wide margin or details sad that's er and news dot com\nBoom\nUsed on nine Ninety weather night partly due mostly cloudy with a low forty nine other cutting God for tomorrow with the ... hour or two and a high Seventy one\nMinute and a couple of hours in the evening otherwise that everybody was all the way down in\nMarshall sunshine on Tuesday with a high in the ... movie than I Am a couple of ... below forty four new mothers unequal on Wednesday with a high of ... and there's plenty of sunshine of the ... ... am nine Ninety ...\nDoes go for an angel network news normal nine Ninety proudly present\nBattle ground on New York joined in the upcoming battle ground torn coming in Philly don't miss this most attentive as I said the future of conservatism and his friend about what's happening in our country\nComing to the green valley country club in Philadelphia Tuesday on till we want to do this is my ...
