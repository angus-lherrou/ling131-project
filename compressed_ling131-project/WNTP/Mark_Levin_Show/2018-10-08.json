{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "Yes there at the time like I'm ... like Linda trip who also had long term uh issues with ... uh what happened the media treatment afterwards and uh you have to talk you talk to him on this show two weeks ago about how um\nIt had long term effects on you as been very difficult for you to find any meaningful employment because people see your name or and they kind of want to stay away from that\nLike what's going on I'm going to be linking to your goal fund me campaign a which is to raise money for a house where are you currently live and you've lived for a long time tell us what what's going on right now with a\nWell I'm very well meaning people that stay some go find me other than a ... a campaign for me [noise]\nWhich is something that I really mean but I ... I only just found out on friday that I happen to be out of my house in a month on ... on November the that that is right before the holidays it out and unfortunately\nNo to me I'm really watching American politics and what's happening in recent years to the Democratic party and I'm looking at the model of the Labour Party in the u._k.\nThe Labour Party in the u._k. has so openly become a party of anti Semitism\nAnd also it happens to coincide and this is obviously not a coincidence with the change of the demographics in Europe with the influx of the Muslim population which has been growing exponentially in Europe and so it looks like the u._k. labor party\nHas first of all taken a political calculation again based on the changes in Europe and the second is it looks like the angels anti Semitism is coming out and I think\nIt's very alarming that we're watching a similar model right now unfold in America with the Democratic party\nNo it's it's scary enough that you have people like Bernie Sanders people like a costs Cortez who their socialist some sort of going along with socialism with anti capitalism with anti patriotism happens to be hand in hand of course anti Israel activism it's one in the same thing\nIf you hate America if you have what we stand for you also by definition hate the only democracy in the middle east Israel and then you side with enemies of western civilization the Islamic extremists in the middle east and then you repeatedly\nAccused Israel of sold all sorts of in the same things that have no basis in reality\nSo first we have the outright radical\nSo and it is scary to me than they are taking over or at least gaining a huge foothold in the Democrat Party\nIncluding by the way in Florida with the candidates the of Andrew Gillum which I haven't been hearing this radio show investigating and exposing including for his open anti Israel associations in open anti Israel statements\nSo that's one thing but there's another\nElement of what's happening in the Democratic party and ground zero for that is actually here in New York with Christian ...\nKnow Gillibrand doesn't stand for anything she's sort of like Hillary Clinton was when she was a senator she blows with the Web whatever's popular back in the day and many people have pointed this out she was a so called moderate Republican Democrat even supporting the n._r._a.\nAnd so if somebody like a ... and who was not um ideologically a Bernie Sanders we're in Andrew Gillum we're in a car sea of Cortez we kind of understand that when you are radical anti American socialist you also have Israel Jill it ran in the past has supported Israel\nBut in the last few years she is clearly making it calculated decision to abandon Israel and to me that that's what's actually in ... almost as dangerous if not maybe more dangerous\nThan the rise of the radical left which is also anti Israel because if ... brand who by definition I think stands for nothing but in the past has supported Israel because she needs to get votes if she here in New York has media calculus which she has\nTo abandon Israel then what does that say about the trajectory of the Democratic party and where it is now\nAnd how in order to be elected you have to spouses radical progressive policy an on board with that is anti Israel attitude so I Want\nFirst of all I Would love to hear from the Jews of New York or the Christians of New York who support Israel eight seven seven nine seven zero to nine nine nine are you concerned about Kirsten Gillibrand\nBut second anyone is listening right now if you're in New York and you vote hit careful attention\nIn fact whole your friends and family members and tell them to tune into right now\nBecause the time has come\nTo expose Christians ... anti Israel attitude or at least to highlight it because nobody seems to be talking about it and I cannot believe that anyone who\nWould care about Israel and also of course hand in hand care about the United states would ever vote for Kirsten Gillibrand\nKnow first of all to me and the story is the fact that she first supported the in fact she was a sponsor of legislation that would oppose\nThe anti Semitic boycott movement the BCS campaign the extremists campaign targeting the Jewish state be the best boycott the investment sanctions\nThe movement that ignores\nWilliam ... human rights abuses in the Palestinian areas ignores the way that women and minorities are treated ignores the way the Muslims are killing other Muslims and yet singled out the only democracy in Israel\nThe only country in the entire Middle East that has full equal rights for everybody and that is the country that you are going to single out and boycott\nIt's insane it's anti democratic and anti American of course every peace loving American must support\nLegislation that opposes the BCS movement\nSo first Kirsten Gillibrand supported this stuff in other words supported sanctioning people who support to BBS movement financially but then what happened was she was confronted at town halls by radical anti Israel groups especially Jewish Voice for peace\nAnd in fact actually I found that\nAn anti Israel activists took personal credit his name is Raphael ... of who uh is an anti Israel ... activists in New York\nFounder of multiple anti Israel groups including by the way the Jews friend Linda as in Jews who support Linda source or the grab an anti Semite so that tells you all you need to know the Raphael he took credit quote\nFor leading this is his quote from his bio successful actions helping to reverse the New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's key support of a federal anti bbs\nBill so\nIn other words first she supports it then she is confronted quote unquote by Palestinian activists out town halls then all of a sudden Kirsten Gillibrand breaks with the mainstream of the Democratic party by the way the bill is co sponsored by a Democrat and Republican because it should be bipartisan\nShe breaks with them and she refuses to support a bill that she ... originally sponsored so it's not just that she is rejecting it in general she sponsored it she pulled her name from it\nHow can you care for Israel and vote for somebody who doesn't support legislation to oppose a boycott of Israel and she did it clearly he or she claims that was for it because I support the freedom of speech and I have some freedom of speech issues\nAt first of all even the Democrats on board and it's almost all of them\nWho support this bill and support freedom of speech they have written many times how this has nothing to do with freedom of speech so believe you me she did not pull her support for that reason she pulled it has this activists took credit for it because she wants to position herself here in New York\nToward the progressive anti Israel elements which is now moving to the mainstream through jeweler brand of the Democratic party\nI should say the Democratic party which is quickly becoming like the Labour Party in the u._k.\nAnd Christians celebrate the perfect bellwether for what's happening to it the fact that she would change like this\nThen also in New York you had within the New York Jewish community huge opposition to the Iran nuclear deal\nIn fact actually be beaten it's on Yahoo and the Israeli government\nWere so concerned that Obama's nuclear deal would ah let us just say as we all know um go up against the national security interests of the United states and also of Israel remember Bebe took the unprecedented move\nOf having a addressing a joint session of Congress wait before the vote we're sitting prime minister warned\nAgainst the deal being negotiated by a sitting American presidents\nAnd what to Kirsten Gillibrand do and this has implications obviously also for American national security chief strongly supported the bill and then actually when Donald Trump ah thankfully it got America out of the Iran nuclear deal here's her announcement\nCool I strongly oppose President Trump's shortsighted and dangerous decision to leave the juicy pie away which of course there's the Iran nuclear deal\nChristian the deal is shortsighted and dangerous how can you support American national security and support a deal that has a sunset clause that will give Iran nuclear weapons when is out\nAnd had nothing to say about ballistic missile test no one's no real inspections the whole thing's a total joke and every single senator who supported the Iran deal must be voted out of office and Christians in the branch here in New York is one of them\nNow by the way it gets worse what let's take a break from it at age seven seven nine seven zero to nine nine nine because I Want to do this with your phone calls and by this I mean also Jula Brandon Linda star sore\nYeah one other point if you don't mind 'cause I Know it's quick or I Believe it said University of southern Maine state institution that some left the professor up there that day the so called students' academic credit for going to learn to teach the protests\nNot not surprising academia is is there is this problem now on for a while has been and I when I say this problem I mean like a lack of\nAny rationality it's been confined to the looney tunes in the college campuses but now it's in the Democratic party they banned it in a region that is truly scary\nBuilt thank you it's going to have it all in Pennsylvania you are welcome\nGo for it they aren't that you're very much first of all I just wanted to thank you um for your coverage of the uh cabin all debacle and this and I look forward to your show every Sunday or get a lot of information from you and it's and and now I Believe it's it's probably be the best information I listen to a lot of talk radio\nBut your show for three hours I enjoy it so much but you were you were on for three weeks ago with with capital I mean uh the way that they put\nThe ... the Democrats really I I don't think there's going to be a blue wave is going to be a big way because\nWe are you kidding me like how many times will read that there was no electoral map for a path for Donald Trump to win a how many times where he told that it was impossible by the media I think they like this crowd psychology where everybody believes that there is a blue wave\n'em maybe no one will go out to vote or walk out and go to college or you know you\nTalk about the senator Gillibrand's person I mean she came right out before any of the evidence it called capital rapist I mean this is how brutal\nMeanwhile our number one political donor tried this island it's the female accusers\nOf Harvey Weinstein are you kidding me and I'd away her opponent show Farley was running again is Julie Brown is going to be here in about five minutes I hear thank you let's go to Ellie in Staten Island if we have some time Eliot go for it\n\nAnd I love your show but you got to stop using the word out there and that that may not name they are not Arab occupied as a Jewish land when you are in Yahoo they'll just keep on with them I think a certain group of people that have had no legitimacy\nIn LA I agree with you I agree with you know the only problem is that when I speak if people are listening I'm there so familiar with the term Palestinian but you're right by the way I also don't like 'em a West Bank because it also doesn't exist industry deanna scenario [noise]\nUm and I can't stand East Jerusalem there's no such city it's called the eastern sections of Islam but only one city and as the capital of

comments and it's you would find it fascinating because you are a study of\nA writer and and you know here here's my my partial response to that and I I think one of the reasons that for people like yourself\nWho have had severe doubts about President Trump this does bring Republicans together because the point is if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh\nHe is about as mainstream he's not somebody who's out there and we had um a fairly distinguished lawyer at our at our table who had been part of the Ted Cruz campaign\nAnd uh he was at our table over the Sabbath and he pointed out that if you looked at the names on that Heritage Foundation list\nBrett Kavanaugh was the most moderate person he could have possibly picked if you look at his judicial record\nHe is not someone on the extreme right at all he is a down the line like Samuel Alito like a Antonin Scalia he has a mainstream normal very distinguished conservative\nSo if they are going to make him a victim of this kind of character assassination they do with anybody that do it to you\nI I feel like as a conservative and the reason I was a never Trump or mainly because I Want to conserve conservatism or the long run I was playing the longer right um\nAnd I think you were to which really attracted me to your show thing I've even kind of slightly distance myself from Craig or only because he's so gung ho I'm\nOK
