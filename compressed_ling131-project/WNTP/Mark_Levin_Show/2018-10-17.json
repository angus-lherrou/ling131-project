film in history\n[noise] uh I think quite simply that when you imagine a left wing critic particularly somebody who is who is the premiums are really the result of emotion dog about magic or something like that\nWalking into the theater and seeing all their basic assumptions just for radically overturned and done so in in ... intellectually powerful way and they don't know how to respond so they're very discombobulated and angry and when they leave the theater there\n... or ... how do I get the movie and they realize that the way that they can get it is by writing of review the feds or not I disagree with the movie but I don't know why\nOr I don't have good arguments counter this but they say extremely boring movie worth ever made their way to watch the first ten minutes so\nThis is the way in which it intellectually ended up ... immature people were on when their world view was overturned\nI look at it I think there's a great deal to what you're saying because I recently Michael Moore came out with his new movie Fahrenheit eleven nine\nAh and ah this is a movie about supposedly about Donald Trump and now he's ruining America is the end of the world and the movie had tremendous hype it had very good reviews though not so much for me and a and it proceeded to bomb nice he's actually going to end up reaching a fraction of the people you reach with death of America\nWell the thing to realize is that Michael Moore was problem with the coke or will it back in Studio ... give him the money to make the movies he's on every talk show he gets old republic pretty whereas our movie\nI mean if if my movie with ... mentioned on ABC NBC CBS warned about it from CNN or MSN to the ... yard if not covered at all the luck disorder\nThey they go out of their way for a north of film and yet despite all that and Michael Moore by the way opened hunt with theater reopened thousand theaters and we did about the same at the opening weekend that it will be ... like a stone\nSo it has yours kind of guy and that that makes the heart of it is that look I'm not making the point you're on the ideological because I actually\nLike Michael Moore first of all the aid or which was a clever movie an established hatred are out of what he had quit at that point\nYeah well the point about this new film I Know you haven't seen it I have Michael Moore's movie ... movie death of the nation or you can stream right now at death of a nation movie dot com\nBut the other point about Moore's movie it begins almost identical to your movie except your movie covers the materials so much better it's so much more washable\nAnd it's actually very funny the way you do it what you do at the beginning of the film is you go back to election night and you show the change from the beginning of election night where the anchors beginning they're all happy and exciting\nThere are about to welcome the first female president and Hillary of course it was going to win and then you show the increasing desperation and heartbreak as it becomes clear that the result wasn't what people expected\nMichael Moore does the same thing but he doesn't play it for laughs he plays it oh my goodness this is the beginning of a nightmare and a tragedy and it's just not washable\nI'm ... in terms of my response to the film the one segment of the film that I think is most unforgettable
