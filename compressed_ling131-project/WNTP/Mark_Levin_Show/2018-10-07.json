it is a ... it's more than believable but it's believable based on facts based on evidence not on emotion not on a somebody being able to\nPerform as we've talked about a very believable in that you know\nIn that starring role that she played and um but uh that's one thing but to save somebody is credible especially when you're talking about something like this and they and the idea that this is not a court of law yes that's true because let me tell you if it was a quarter law\nThese none of these cases would have come before the court\nThey just throwing it out and that was my big question

nothing constantly changing the tech world huh [noise]\nWell this coming week October knife is the day Google is said to announce their brand new phones of course there's the pixels it's bigger better called the pixel three\nAnd go actually having some fun a head of the pixels free launch those phones leaked and details so I guess the company's trying to play it up\nThe Instagram page made by Google to eat out a photo that shows several sizes of the brand new pixel and attacks the company says that they heard a rumor\nAbout the brand new many pixels it's really really tiny and asked how small is too small and some people would probably love to see a smaller pixel but this one is a phone that small enough to attach to your key chain\nAnd it's a rumor do in real life exposed\nGonna have edge to edge screen no notch\nOr a front facing camera and then hopefully these new picture phones won't have the same feature that the last one did it was called pixel Burnett yeah bad news there but to\nMe well if you're on windows there's a massive up day that you have to make sure that you get you need this and has a\nTon of features including a new dark mode for explore\nThat the easier way to take screen shots those are so handy but the really big deal is that windows now works with your smartphone better than ever before it's called your phone application but here's the deal windows now works really great with your Android phones\nBut you see all the new tax you received photos right there and windows ten you can respond to text messages right from your computer now that

quick check for updates and then took the result checked for updates and then you'll be there or just keep in mind it takes a while you any will lead to research your computer and Microsoft has a walk through video on that page in case you need a hand but in other Microsoft news\nThe company actually had a slew\nOf new services to show a elder bagel president this past week in New York City\nThey debuted at a quad core surface pro six a faster surface laptop to and then they actually a lot of people were surprised about this court conduct connected surface headphones it's okay here's the bottom line\nWe start looking at the brand new surface at sixty seven percent more power we're talking about aids and Gen intel chip one gig at the the uh Seventeen hours battery life still one point seven pounds eighty five percent faster the surface laptop to being released actually on October sixteen\nAnd this is actually the first laptop that Microsoft has ever offered in black little funds back for you there uh as far as those headphones they're not cheap turned fifty bucks\nAnd they are noise canceling ear can so there you know some big headphones there now here's the deal is is also something new is that if you can't afford a brand new services [noise]\nAnd that now Microsoft has its financing program that you can finance lose hardware accessories or for about twenty five bucks a month or more than you might be wondering if I look at the surface pro how does it compare to the guy pad pro well that's\nReally what you're looking yeah as far as the starting price ... the surface pro is nine hundred bucks wow\nThe apple eye pad pro is eight hundred bucks for a comparable size twelve point nine inches\nOr they you know pretty much have everything built in you're talking about you know five hundred and twelve gigs the surface pro actually goes up to one gig the way is about the same dimensions are truly about the same battery life on the eye pad pros ten hours Thirteen and a half on the surface pro so\nIt's really get down to preference if you are a Microsoft\nPercent knew like Microsoft products you use windows then you are really going to like say that Microsoft

pick up and attack can bypass detection from the human ears and then start causing havoc\n[noise] so the researchers say that the attacks you psycho Cusick hiding to mess they're true intentions\nAnd so this bird chirping or something that is sub audible could be hidden inside a commercial that plays on television or the radio and had thousands of targets that was All right so you're like OK what has happened yet but when it happens how to protect myself\nWell there aren't a lot of security that exams far speakers that's a problem I mean you put a pin on your Alexa\nA or you can just turn it off we're not using it but the researchers say that this was possible\nAnd they fully expect it to happen within the near future and feeding of attacks\nIt seems like anyone who I meet they always

of phone calls tonight or especially on Brent Kavanaugh and again women have priority front too long\nYou know I I Want to forget for a minute just the specifics be micro of what happens in the last twenty four hours let's take a step back\nAnd understand and reflect upon what just happened as a society because to me and this was restoring sanity ...\nThis is restoring sanity as the left as the Democratic party has a band and everything abandoned rationality a brand in their own principles abandoned justice abandoned even claims of being liberal\nIn fact abandoned sanity itself I think\nThis was not simply about Brett Kavanaugh on the accusations against him\nAnd of course first of all the first woman Dr Ford of course brings witnesses that claim that themselves said that they never met him before there was never started party before a such a party no core operation in fact all of the evidence that she brought this proved her case\nAnd the story there is no prosecutor on earth would ever have brought charges against Brett Kavanaugh did not rise to that level and actually Dr forward in\nMany cases discredited herself in fact lied and then it was proven to be a lie\nAnd then you had these two other accusations that immediately fell apart reject you listeners so to me what happened when I say to me I'm Talking about somebody who has been on the inside of the me too movement\nI was in Alabama when accusations were deployed similarly in a very similar faster and in fact in fact he was actually the exact same media\nOutlets the Washington Post strategically dropped it at all these accusations were white before an election against Roy Moore\nAnd then even before that of course I was on the ground and did very how let us just say impactful reporting or when the me too movement really started even before that with accusations that were totally discredited against Donald\nTrump\nSo what happened with Brett Kavanaugh this is the first time that\nA man has stood up to accusations in this case you don't let me just stop here for a minute and say first of all I of all people have\nMade this radio show and you all knew with us from listening this radio show my reporting I haven't been a safe space for all women who have\nAccusations of sexual assault but\nThe problem is that the left in America has hijacked the me too movement and what they're trying to do here is they're saying not only there's a woman who is accusing somebody of sexual assault or it was a sexual harassment not only does she have a right to be heard\nWhich everybody agrees to of course we must hear these accusations they are very serious and we must take them seriously\nBut what the Democrat Party tried to do here and what the left has been trying to do because they are famous at hijacking movements what they're doing here is taking it from a right to be heard which clearly is ... is the way it's supposed to be\nTo the right to be believe\nLet me tell you there is no right to be believed at all if you call them with an accusation and its credible and its corroborated if for example let's say you're accusing the president of raping view in a hotel room in Nineteen Seventy eight\nAnd there's documentation that that President at at the time was in that hotel and you've got a nurse\nI'm Talking of course about one either Broderick who finds her twenty minutes later her pantyhose ... blood dripping from her nose because he was punched\nIn the mouth she says by Bill Clinton than that I Would say a rise is absolutely to the level\nOf credible accusations and by the way it is it's not a Democrat Republican if there were similar accusations against every ... or a Republican and they're proven and they're credible then yes okay but a woman with accusations that\nWitnesses that contradicts her and say they were never at the party that rings testimony that brings a so called evidence that then falls apart that contradicts\nHerself and gives different numbers of men in the room and in her therapist testimony\nThat says she was afraid to fly and then she's flying all over the place all the time\nI Am sorry you have no right to be believed and it is a dangerous dangerous world in which we will live if anybody with any accusation is immediately believe\nNo you've got to prove your case you have no right to be believed no matter who you are or what you were accusing anybody a view of the right to be heard\nAnd so the Soros funded more on the minions out there the rent a mobs protesters and I've been reporting on exposing that for example the two women who confronted oh the whole media ignores the fact\nThat one of the two women confronting quote unquote Jeff Flake with\nThat CNN camera crew that happened to have been there at that exact same time I pointed out and documented that actually she is the leader ... ... the co director of a massively George Soros financed organization that taught that got just now eighty\nTwo million eighty two million they're raising against Donald Trump\nSo the ... millions out there in front of the Supreme Court with the science or are they all show up later we're\nSupposed to believe that this is like a spontaneous protest they're all wearing the same exact Easter it says women have a right to believe believe women no women no men nobody has a right to be believed in America you have a right to be heard\nSaid OK and again I'm taking your phone calls on this issue eight seven seven nine seven zero to nine nine nine eight seven seven nine seven zero to nine nine nine\nSo okay what happened yesterday with the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh was not simply about only his case this was a test case for the me too movement for rationality in America are you going to have\nA career or careers destroyed and this could have been anyone I simply for accusations that are not proven and again that are actually largely discredited\nThat's what the vote was about yesterday it wasn't about just confirming Brett Kavanaugh it was about the future of the United states do we have rule of law do we have innocent until proven guilty for\nOur accusations even you know gang rape is a woman let's say\nWho comes and clams as she did that Brett Kavanaugh participated in gang rapes at parties that took place every single week so okay therefore if women have a right to be believed that makes Brett Kavanaugh what a gang rape is really because of accusations even though they're totally unproven and discredited\nThat's what the Democrats who voted for yesterday the Democrats have so thoroughly discredited themselves\nSoups so low so\nTrends parent they have by the way discredited the me too movement\nThey have done knows service for women in fact actually Dianne Feinstein who waits until the last minute\nAnd then probably leaks who knows where this came from the name of an accuser here a female accuser who well she said she didn't want her name out there but then of course just kinda waiting sending emails to the Washington Post so I'm not so sure by\nThe Democrats have thoroughly discredited not only themselves but to me too movement actually\nIf this is the party that you want in power if you want a party in power that will twist reality that will take reality and turn it on its head\nThat will twist and turn over right it's an old uh sensibilities of justice in America if that the Democratic party this radical extremists Democratic Party under Feinstein\nUnder Schumer who has also totally discouraged himself did you see his speech on Saturday a ballot at the Y. Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be a in the Supreme Court it was one piece of obvious lie after the other\nI mean he could barely keep a straight face he has to know that he is logging and twisting and turning reality into something other than what it is\nSo that's why the midterm elections are so critical and I think the base is understanding but I Hope that beyond the days that they understand what the Democrats would do if they get power\nWe saw who they are they are evil evil people the way what they did to this man what they did with these accusations this is beyond anything I have seen ever in my lifetime and I think you as well\nYou're almost or waved in a rural um your best friend you you didn't leave the party on your best friend is still at the party really with two rapists you're going to leave her there um you know there there are questions here two thousand twelve the therapist notes he talked about for boys who tried to rape her\nAnd then later on I became two boys you know on and on it goes so to me the performance was interesting but I judge also based on ah the facts and the facts are choosing not credible to improve their case and I think he's not credible and thank\nYou\nSure thank you so much for your phone call let's go to Caroline in New York City also calling about Cabot all the little Caroline\nHerron I'm considered that it was made up story right from the get so she didn't want anybody Trump he was going to put them back\nTo win money so he knows that sounds a little dicey a things started getting everything I think that they just want to obstruct an abstract so the whole thing with the talk shows and Dianne Feinstein\nWaited waited waited till she came up with a leather until the last meal and the hero\nAnd I thought they treated him so badly the Democrat treated that man so badly even when they were questioning like dance such experts they are such acts by then they're stupid I Can't get over it\nYou know I wrote an article um before any of these sexual assault allegations came out I was quoting um topics outright from a top a progressive activists from the Hillary camp who goes on and see it out of spells out\nI'm exactly the case which has delayed delayed the life of strong and they threw everything at him it was um\nIf there weren't enough documents that were put out the tens of thousands of documents on Kavanaugh was lost jobs they asked him more questions than any other is in fact actually somebody added it up\nAnd he was asked more questions than all other Supreme Court justices come by hand and they try to lay with those that didn't work and some\nLast minute they throw these accusations and then then they want an FBI investigation and then they say the FBI is credible and then the FBI investigation or basically find no evidence and then all of a sudden the Democrats clam the FBI that they said was credible is not so to me\nThat there are crowds are the real losers of all of this and I'm going to be\nTaking more phone calls max said eight seven seven nine and seven zero to nine nine item I think the Democrats over extended their handles\nThey show just how far they're willing to go and I think that they're going to pay a price in the mid term but again they've got plans for the Supreme Court\nBeyond Kavanaugh and I'll talk about that next\nMore of your phone calls I got eight minutes haven't died seven zero to nine nine I\n[noise]\nWould answer and news on board and even the ... one of the victims in a limousine crash that killed twenty people upstate New York says that the beagles on its way to a birthday party Valerie ... says the newlyweds\nErin ... a gallon were among those killed cheeses virtue she was ... a gallon was thirty she says the family has not learn much about the circumstances of the crash it isn't clear whose birthday it was\nThe average us price of regular great gasoline has in sub seven cents a gallon over the past two weeks now costs to two Ninety seven that's the average to Ninety seven per gallon industry analyst\nThere'll be ... survey says that's forty one cents a gallon higher than at this time last year Nunberg said Sunday the rising crude oil prices are the main reasonably increase\nAt the pump Interpol says the Chinese officials was reported missing have resigned as head of the international police agency ... news\n\nNewtown and nine Ninety whether\nCloud anymore him and he made the evening alone sixty eight\nMonday mostly cloudy and my name or do they very warm remaining he made it back in the clouds and make them with the sunshine high any one day very warm with considerable crowding in my view and then by Thursday humid when pain rain in some of the time\nI I ... and nine Ninety nine Ninety dot com\nGr desk for enjoyment we're new storm nine Ninety probably president Ronald brown or\nThis is my ...
