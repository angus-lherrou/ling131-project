qualified just go to ensure kids now got gum or call one eight Seventy seven kids now that's one eighty seven seven five four three nine\nMade for U.S Department of health and Human Services\nOn the radio show in America the broadcast live from the middle [noise] they're inclined to\nWant to go right now from uh Florida\nTo New York but actually all of this is interconnected\nTo mid term elections are not just about what is happening locally although that is also critical um this is national and this is the most critical midterm election certainly that I can remember of my lifetime\nHow dreamy right now is Naomi live them a who is running for Congress in\nNew York's tense congressional district which yes that is Jerry now there's district right now it encompasses the Upper West side of Manhattan West side of midtown Manhattan west side of lower Manhattan including of course the financial district sight of ground zero\nAlso sections of Brooklyn or in other words people listening to me right now you're definitely in the attempt district among uh the the radio audience so you have to get out there and vote you have to check out the website it's only for Congress dot com\nNaomi live and welcome back to Aaron client investigative radio I\nThink it did it on\nUm so you know again don't even know where to begin because there's so much a that is so relevant to the contents of congressional districts um but also relevant on a national level but I Want you let's search to talk about about talking about\nFreedom it that's part of what this is all about at the end of the day is the American way is American exceptionalism is is democracy and freedom or talk about why that is important in your election at and to you personally\nYes and everything from me crime is down ... hour week American Bar losing our\nFreedoms and ... and learn because I was ... by people who risked everything to get here my parents um because of what they taught me\nTo turn meant quite a congressman fight for our American values and our interests and Mexico catches correspondence term national security on extending educational opportunity because that's a ... pack our culture and our lowering our tax break and\nYou know I'm running for Congress not custody charcoal or her state\nBecause I Want to steer the country in the right direction and after congresswoman I Want\nA we're speaking with Naomi live them at ... am I right\nWhen I say that this was yes it's absolutely about local issues there's no question about it but but this there's a lot more to this right now why should people\nWho are listening right now and might not even get out to vote unfortunately and I think that that's very tragic why ah why why is this midterm why is your district why is this so important right now\nI think that we can all I'm Steve that our country is becoming more and more polarized those extreme polarization in Washington and Lee ... leader to shoot kind of\nBe a moderate voice and focus on issues I'm personally my ... it's ...\nI could buy and and I stress Greece in the eye and I want to bring the focus back issues that people care about the history you know for example\nUm my ... care only about extracting the current administration and he doesn't care about motorists who says okay thank you so you know the voters are much more interested in improving our economy and you know how things job grandparents fed\nThan instructing our government\nAnd was in the main interest\nSo that's what I wanted to I Want to you know I've been on the street every day listening to the concerns of who lives here and I want to carry those concerns me to Congress and get them to try\nTo me when I look at ... he was the only a Democrat who's Jewish from New York the only Jewish Democrat to endorse President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd to me when you have a country that literally calls for Israel to be wiped off the map a country that strangling Israel to the north in Syria a country that is feeding terrorists in the Gaza Strip\nA country that is putting ballistic missiles writing on the ballistic missiles the writing Jerusalem and then of course alongside that they're writing America\nThere is no way that you can look at the nuclear deal and view that in any way shape or form as good for American national security and you know it's so bad for Israel that the prime minister of Israel at the time\nOr in two thousand uh sixteen ... uh came to America and in a very rare or a ... a ... appearance he addressed a joint session of Congress and he spoke out against a sitting presidents nuclear deal that's how dangerous it is for Israel or\nShouldn't voters who get out there should should they really keep in mind when they're voting and attempt ... congressional district that Jerry now they're supported the Iran nuclear deal\nAbsolutely I mean today we're dealing with the aftermath they round nuclear Tiahrt and Jerry now there's voter are certainly much more concerned a key thing our enemies like run them yet\nThat there are human beings who are responsible apparently for the banning of conservatives of people on YouTube like diamonds silk or simply supporting the president of the United states of America\nI mean really you think of these huge tech giants who I've accumulated so much power as I don't know like question marks or almost like God like figures or just people that we don't understand our actual people\nWell thanks to the enterprising reporting at Breitbart where I served as senior investigative reporter and Jerusalem bureau chief we now know who these Nineteen eighty four asked dictator is are\nWe can now see for ourselves who again we are giving so much power to\nLiterally giving over our emails to them or at least using them for our emails that Gmail giving over our locations to them on our maps on our cell phones\nThese are the people that now we can understand why they're censoring ... who they are and we need to see this or that we can understand that every single time we're doing a Google Search [noise]\nThis is who is really behind that search engine so thanks or Breitbart dot com they leaked out or we leaked out or somebody leaked to us\nI'm a one hour meeting that took place at Google this was immediately after the two thousand six team presidential election\nNow in the video we're talking about the leaders of Google\nLake Larry Page and Sergey Brin where the founders are the major vice presidents the CFO the c._e._o. and we can see and we can here and we can watch for ourselves who and what these wizards behind the curtain truly an really are\nAnd it's actually critical to hear what they have to say it is critical to hear again this huge conglomerate Google that is so integral to so many aspects of our daily lives\nWhat they think of you what they think of the Trump lawyer and actually they're caught with in this meaning that they had that was ... that was videotaped in two thousand six came immediately after Donald Trump's election\nThey talk about in fact how to make sure in fact how to let's just say\nGet rid of the influence plotting to use their resources just for\nThe agenda of Donald Trump which is of course the agenda of America and the agenda that Google and YouTube and Twitter and Facebook can't allow to happen because of illegal aliens don't cross the border as well they're going to have to pay Americans full wage salaries and so this is a lot about money\nBut then also and so you can clearly see these people are like borderline psychotic this is beyond just money and it is scary and it is very important for every single person listening right now call your friends call your neighbors and tell them to tune in because we're going inside\nGoogle itself\nWith a video that was smuggled out from Google days after the two dozen sixteen presidential election\nOf a Google's are all hands on deck meeting which apparently these or weekly meetings they're known as TGIF thank God it is friday meetings and here is the T. G. I. F. meeting\nAfter the two thousand and sixteen election in which they basically mourn the loss of Hillary but it goes way beyond that\nAnd to me by the way you know just the fact that they help this meeting is so weird\nI don't know any major corporations that hold meetings to basically do like this therapy session on presidential elections\nBecause they're not even supposed to be political at all these are tech giants their jobs are not politics their jobs are supposed to be well you know technical stuff\nEmails search engines algorithms things like that\nThey're not running presidential campaigns\nBy the way even we at Breitbart and we report on politics that's what we do we didn't hold any meeting after the two thousand and six in presidential election\nAnd by the way I previously and other places where I work which also were heavily involved in politics we didn't hold any meeting after Obama won in two thousand and eight in order to mourn the loss of America or at least the fundamental transformation\nSo just the fact of this meeting alone should alarm all of us because again we give so much as I'm speaking I guarantee you you are you have so much on your cell phone right now the ... goes right through\nThe people that you are about to hear\nAnd finally we can see who these in these cycles really truly are so let's start with uh with with surging brand who is the cofounder of Google and how he opened this T. G. I. F. meeting right after Donald Trump's victory\nOkay folks I Know this is probably not the most joyous a teacher I have had\n[noise] um [noise]\nAnd uh you know place that most\nPeople here are are pretty upset and pretty sad her\nWay to stop there because the owners are pretty upset pretty sad\nPretty upset him pretty sad at\nThe election of a president who says that he wants to shut down the borders or at least put border security\nPretty upset pretty sad\nAt a president who won who wants to get rid of ... totally corrupt establishment and all of these insane trade deals how could you be pretty upset and pretty sad\nAbout America winning unless you are not on the side of America continue surgery brown\nA because of the election [noise] um but there's another group a small group that we should also think about who are very excited about the legalization of pot [laughter]\nUm\n[noise] ...\nCERN joints outside on the patio\n[noise] a parent\nParents like these things take a little while to take us back to [noise]\nEither way you should be scared of this and not be laughing because he's got they're glorifying them a culture here of glorifying drugs in this case pot inside Google\nAnd of course he made a little joke because he was saying there's a small segment and you would think that he was gonna say who are excited about the election of Donald Trump\nBut there isn't even a small segment and Google very likely because that is the culture they're not just of drugs but of progressive politics when there shouldn't be any politics at all at Google let's continue a surgery\nOr as an immigrant and refugee I'm I'm I certainly find reflection a deeply offensive and I know many of you do to\nOf course you know how as an immigrant who came here legally he should find a deeply offensive that Hillary wants to put illegal aliens before people who are working legal easy to get into this country\nBut this just give you a tiny drop of a a taste for who and what is behind your Google Search engines\nSo now let's get to the senior vice president for global affairs can't Walker who now and this is crazy he is now explaining are trying to explain because the people at Google are living in this a\nTotally different snowflake zone in San Francisco in Silicon valley he's now going to explain to us who you are who is the Trump voter who's going to explain it to Google people\nSo again this is a their senior vice president for global affairs Kent Walker and he is within the ... this is within the context what you're about to hear of him trying to explain how Trump walking and you push it into the larger glue a global context well apparently that's what he's trying to\nGrow up and you are and what's the path forward\nThe forces out there are seem well beyond ... immigration crave when I was ... and you're afraid and you're trying to look for answers\nAnd that the er I think not just the United states but around the world is what's fueling concerns Xena phobia hatred I and a desire for for answers that may or may not be there\nAgain when he says I don't phobia\nNo this is as Google employees hug each other because they are mourning the loss of Hillary Clinton a and mourning the election of Donald Trump and it is is sickening but it's beyond sickening it is scary to me and this is the culture and how can you imagine by the way\nBeing a Donald Trump supporter\nOr somebody who simply is not a Hillary supporter and you're working inside a company where every major member of the company gets up and speaks on basically as if they're part of the Democratic establishment which clearly they are and then you're supposed to hug somebody because Donald Trump won\nAnd you're hugging here not out of celebration\nBut you know I Want to rewind for a few seconds because we have to stress something that she and the CFO set and just so\nIncredibly critical here let's take a look I we played or just a few seconds ago let's just rewind because she literally says and I want you to take a very careful listen how she says quote we will use quote use the great strengths\nAnd resources we have to come to an advance really important values\nNow what values should she could she be referring to and she's clearly you're saying here they're going to use the strength of Google to advance the Democrats wash progressive agenda she says it we have to take this is huge take a listen\nOh and before though how hold on actually let me correct myself we did not play this audio yet so listen this is enormous bombshell stuff\nAnd that's one of the many things that I think makes this company says eight of them are values are strong now we will fight to protect them and we will use the great strength and resources and reach we have to continue to advance really important value [noise]\nReally important values and you can hear from her the tears in her office in her a voice in her eyes are in her as she breaks down over the election of Donald Trump what values she is referring to\nVisit and the people that you use constantly and the argues constantly this is what and who is behind Google\nWe have to pay very careful attention to this leaked out audio and video from two thousand six chain because on masks\nThe psych goes but beyond cycle was the\nA progressive activists me Democrat activists behind the giants of Google more next

Michael ... dot com and I should also noticed Brian did that uh the battle of New Orleans and the miraculous details concerning that battle also feature in my book the American miracle yeah the\nAh President Trump is restored Andrew Jackson's portraits of the White House and he clearly admires president Jackson I could present from for this moment in his presidency with all of its challenges to he learn something from Jackson's example\nI think so because Jackson was like LBJ rail BJ was Jackson more where he said okay what do you need to get it done because you've got to get what I Want done\nHe cut a lot of deals with the Senate and leverage to leverage their power a gotten a lot of people's face but in the end he got things done and he ... he turn the economy over to Martin Van Buren actually with a surplus and he was the last president to do that\nNot have a deficit so I think that he had to make some deals for that to the same time\nUh you know both to programs that will allow their country to grow and he understood the working class more than ... percent more than that it was more the rope or the watch it um\nYou know more than John Quincy Adams says he was born a legal means an orphan and he understood he really thought a Midwest and then the south or the southwest was totally ignored\nSo I think that because Donald Trump constituency is the same one in proportion I didn't go in and cut some deals in order to average greater objective propelled and then see what happened\nAfter two years if he loses the house you don't see what happens after six years if you get the second tour so I think that's what they need to learn but\nRelentless the fighting spirit he's pretty much got that down\n[laughter] yeah he does um but Jackson a ... in terms of his fighting spirit also have this great ability of making up with people that he was fighting against the one point he had he had actually for a\nDual with uh I've been involved in a very bloody brawl with Thomas hard Benton the senator from Missouri who became one of his closest allies and help get his program through that may be comparable to the Ted Cruz Donald Trump relationship\nAnd Marco Rubio and Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham Andy Nikki Haley a\nHe has a lot of people that were critical of hair and working with it by where they were were were willing to put it aside and support him and for the most part everybody has I think this evolution others other team is is much more supportive who Donald Trump is Larry Kudlow the Gary Cohn\nSo Larry Kudlow said this Donald Trump got to get over this free trade agreement but you're free trade free trade is good and Donald Trump is is almost one Larry over but he didn't uh he did not want to come in because\nHe said you know the I Can't really go along with Boston up all these deals but then after a few months after talking to him he's now in in the beginning Trump was were\nYou know I think I think the idea for Larry is that at a he's believing President Trump\nThat the whole goal of a tougher negotiating posture is lower tariffs all around\nFor us and for them we will be right back uh with just a few minutes more with Brian killing made the is the author of Andrew Jackson and the miracle of New Orleans the battle that shaped America is destiny about his vision of what happens\nIn this faithful election just eight days from today we'll talk about it with Brian kill me coming up [noise]\nMy mid vigil\nLive anywhere in the wind at W.

A. G. E. O. or are there on the Twitter account at Mark Davis follow me there and shoot and stuff they all take a look at the\nVarious things during the during the commercial breaks and as I say that's another whole show that takes place over there but the one that involves um pasta in close proximity is right here and do our phone lines are open for you and I've got some questions for you obviously plenty of things to say but I always couched them in questions for you\nBefore I Begin asking you what you think about some things\nI'm In a time when so little unifies us I think when we were last together on Thursday\nHere on the Larry Elder show I think I went through my usual speech about how unity is for the birds common ground is a is a mess\nAnd in fact we are a better people we are a better government we are a better society when everybody just\nIt is true to their beliefs let the conservatives be conservative and fight for conservative think that the liberals being liberal and fight for liberals things were going to have winters who when losers who loses what the election is about the week from tomorrow the winters are gonna win losers are going to lose and I've been preaching a conservatives for years\nI don't think you're going to win by trying to reach out to the left 'cause all they're going to do is buy your hand off because they ain't reaching out to us\nAnd nor should pay the left should be the left if their ideas prevail good for them not so good for the country in my view but they all this common ground unity come by on nonsense\nI is in terms of policy it is ridiculous but I offer that\nAn on ramp to the following there is a short list of things that unify all of us under the umbrella of our humanity or at least should I Wish it were all of us are but there is a a a little tiny sliver of a subsection of of humanity and its steamy underbelly [noise]\nThat uh that does things like what we've seen in Pittsburgh and so before we dive in and talk about Pittsburgh before we dive in talk about the media reaction and political reactions to Pittsburgh let us just pause and do the most important thing we can do as Americans as people\nAnd that is lift up those last people in prayer let us lift up the soles of those who are shot by this this this monster their\nTheir families their friends their faith community there at the tree of life synagogue it is it is probably it it is sad\nThat it takes thing the only things like this truly unify us but this is not a a policy battle this is not a left versus right thing this is a good versus evil thing\nNow in a minute now you will hear people\nSay that that in their take on good versus evil they consider the president of the United states to be evil well that I'll have a word or two to say about those people but before we before we had down those various rabbit trails of talk show land [noise]\nUm let us just no matter what we are doing right now where I Am here in central time it's a little after five in the sun is shining it's beautiful warm Texas day\nMaybe you're a little bit into your commute on the east coast maybe in a beautiful vistas of mountain time it's late afternoon and you're enjoying whatever you're doing it out on the west coast now did the\nAn elder country of Los Angeles and various other affiliates in California where it's a little bit after three it's the middle the afternoon to Monday and maybe you've come through a weekend filled with blessings filled with faith and failed his family at least that certainly my hope for you [noise] this is exactly what these folks thought\nAs they walked into the synagogue on Saturday morning I've heard a lot of people say that the one victim they can't get out of their heads as the Ninety seven year old woman and I buy confessed to that myself by that any one life is\nIs worth more than any other are like that was really bad I mean they're all bad it's all terribly there's all heart rending\nBut if you're Ninety seven you saw the Holocaust first hand a lot of people who are Ninety seven are Holocaust survivors and they were dwindling generation we should cherish them while they're here\nAnd the notion of somebody surviving that time when we had a global force in the Nazis who's goals included eradication of the Jews\nTo defeat the third Reich to win World War two\nTo ... she'd decades of further one would hope enlightened much a surround the world\nAnd to have that horror be an increasingly distant memory but memory we keep alive there's a reason those words never forget are so important never never forget it's not like this was thousands of years ago with all kinds of brutality were common\nIt's not like it was the ... time and you know just a few centuries ago the kind of world gave birth thank God to the United states of America this is when this was this was the thirties and forties for crying out loud we have people walking around alive who\nWho were ... teenagers and young adults from that time\nAnd this this this wonderful woman was one of them for her to survive all of this only to take a bullet in the safety of her Senate God in in in Pittsburgh in October of twenty Eighteen are you kidding me\nWell no we're uh we're ... we're not kidding there are people who are this twisted there is hatred there is anti Semitism there is racism and massage any and all of these these behaviors that are uh that that are\nSeveral at work in our lives [noise] uh how many such people are there I don't know if it's not many at all but it doesn't doesn't take many this only took one\nI I Am not comforted by the fact that it's a tiny sliver of humanity that that dives to this death but the fact that they want us to many the fact that the any human being taken spew this kind of nonsense of ... about the Jews\nI mean other than any type of hatred makes more or less than the than the other there are some people who hate other people you know because of skin color others who have other people because of religion and others who have other people for a wide variety of reasons\nAnd ... and it's pathetic and\nAll good people you might a segment where we've talked a lot about division and unity all good people unite to to mourn to lift up these people these victims\nThese beautiful souls in that Senate guy we lift them up we celebrate their wealth coming into the arms of a loving God\nAnd we keep their families and that community\nThere and scroll hill and all of Pittsburgh we keep them in our thoughts and prayers and and our our best thoughts as we move forward as we do move forward it is time to take a look at the sorry tawdry bottom feeding that happened is people politicized best oh and you're going to hear\nSome of that and then you're going to hear about some of that from me and I'd like to hear about some of that from you we may not agree on everything that's fine that's why we have phone lines eight eight eight nine seven one said Mark Davis in for Larry Eller very very glad you're here on this money's going to be an important show\nVery blessed to be here with your your at back all through all\nPittsburgh synagogue shooter\nWas some house bird to action by the president warnings about the care of in\nThe thousands of people who are headed our way in order to intentionally violate our borders that a president who is vigilant about that\nYou somehow set the stage for this kind of a reaction\nHow low will\nThese folks go and and and I think the answer is in why does the author\nYou say training I Would be why the author\nVery first\nThing that the president didn't convincingly attacks in Pittsburgh and in the pie found the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous acts\nYou can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individuals who carries out the crime is delivered on the promises he made and if anything I think is sad I and divisive the way that every single thing that comes out of the media and Ninety percent of what comes out of the media is now is negative about this president\nA man came in and that's where our level of discourse has been dragged out\nAs you hear a word for word and page after page and speech after speech about how our our ability to get along just kind of been thrown into the toilet about our level of discourse in civility is all kinds of dashed against the rocks and observation that you certainly can make\nIs that because Trump won or because of a Trump tweet or because of some sharp old bowed a\nSalty thing that he might have said it some rally are you kidding me is everybody that stupid\nReason our discourse has been dragged into the muck is the reaction of people who hate him the reaction of people who cannot handle that she won the media have been biased for as long as many of us have been alive\nAnd the business is nothing new\nBut the level of hatred that's how you know the change is real by the way\nThe level of vitriol the level of venom when you have an entire dominant media culture walks around saying the president is racist the president is a hater out in the world is that how do you think Thanksgiving is going to be a good idea I think your Facebook exchanges are going to go\nSo All right Mark Davis in for Larry Elder more in a moment and right on the phones will you

one towards women they have a message towards homosexuals and so on so forth but\nThey are accusing us of engaging in and tribal politics they they are very good calling the finger\nAnd accusing us of doing what they are engaged in and being what they are it it's really the exact same thing so whenever whenever they scream and yell in big trouble Hitler and and they they make all of these outlet accusation\nUm forever the Republicans have ran into a corner has been back to these corners and now Trump is giving up the oil and and to me it just seems nonsensical for for Donald Trump to kind of

universal and you ... the expectation\nOf the best of our behavior they should I mean you you can have a moment decided yet you wouldn't think even in a a an NBA stadium of Eighteen thousand people or or an NFL stadium obviously it's harder for just one idiot to to disrupt that but usually there's kind of a peer pressure that kicks in\nWhere even somebody as above the is there in the mood to make that moment about them or or to be a jak wagging of some sorts they tend to suppress it\nThese days I'm restraint restraint is not is not as much on the menu\nI get it\nSo I just wanted to get through and you're a ballad\nThank you appreciate it a lot and again the the the number of people for whom\nThis is true the number of folks who who do this a\n... in fact maybe this isn't as good a time as

at that person doing this saying vested in some corner of the public square and if it's a hateful terrible thing the reason they attract attention to it and want to attract your attention to it is so that they can blame President Trump for it we've\nAlways had klansmen we've always had racist we've always had anti Semite it's we've always had been lightened meanders falls walking around among
