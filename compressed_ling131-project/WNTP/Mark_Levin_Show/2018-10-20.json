Marshall PHD this is helpline live let's go to one in Miami and he's got a question about magnesium is linked to blood pressure go ahead and one\nOf my shell thank you I was going you because I had to go um I was string for an Iron Man I I like to do enjoy sports and while extreme I developed can check\n'em to make a long story short active up to the hospital and to get a bunch of cats and then after many cats they discovered that I had high blood pressure\nAt that time I watch them they're a tremendous amount of stress in Australia for an endless sport I had I didn't read anything about it might get annoyed about it and I I think communication my luck I actually thought that the medication\nI Wish you gotta have it how do I know um if they would be so why is it out of high blood pressure I I got kind I don't know how to today what could because I was like when I look at my cash no way to show by my Maisha lego car\nNo it won't and the reason is that um blood tests for magnesium are pretty much useless because I'm magnesium is held in the blood by adrenaline\nAnd in my opinion it's unlikely that the magnesium was the problem or it's more likely that you sweat very heavily you depleted salt you ate food that may have had bugs in it and it got carte blanche to the circulatory tree\nThat's the most common phenomena\nThat links us to a issues with blood pressure's so could it be magnesium yeah but it'd be real hard to tell you could go in a good drugstore now stick your arm in there and see what your blood pressure is no cause no obligation\nTo get an idea of where you are now what I see over and over again with athletes like you is you sweat very heavily and you're not paying attention to salt\nNow most Americans in my opinion eat too much salt\nBut athletes especially in ... athletes anybody doing anything and Durant often deplete salt so the way you can test is one is when you break a sweat you'll reach over to the upper outer part of your arm\nAnd taste the perspiration it should tea you taste slightly salty not anybody else you if it doesn't you need to take a teaspoon of salt like air dried sea salt or better yet are pink song for two or three days until\nYou break the sweat and you can taste it then I Would cut back and hide monitor that so I always have a slightly salty taste\nNow you have plenty of hydro Couric has it and no little bug can get past your stomach okay now if you're still want to support healthy blood pressure and when you go and check your blood pressure\nYou may want to go on something like cardio PG how old are you in much the way\nI'm forty five and I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds\nYep okay so you'd want probably about ... four teaspoons of cardio PG and you would use that for about four months\nAnd that's designed to promote the best help for the circulatory tree and then if you maintain years old but you're getting old enough that salt might it not even do the job for you\nYou really probably should begin taking a couple of quantum died just at the start of Maine cooked meals and then at the end of the meal or maybe three to four detain ...\nNow you have the ... times you had a twenty\nAnd nothing gets passed those guys show a I think you may be fooled by what's going on here okay a magnesium is famous for heart rhythm and for any issue with heart rhythm are but I'm not so much for the blood pressure itself\nOK okay thank you very much You're welcome but um\nAll right let's go right\nBack to the phones let's go to Kristen in California they're trying to conceive Liz nine months and the fertility ... her husband has a very conceal or right are you there Chris than\nThan than how old is your husband\nTrying a new way how it\nCan so what does the doctor recommend for this\nYet at only having care for that and they are law firms are falling to see\nNow I Can't do and that type of family that has cast a guy that research data than what it is kind of\nBad about that ...

blood just about no one who's wearing clothing\nHas a really ideal vitamin D three level\nAnd it's been shown to be involved in literally all of the immune compounds the body makes it's been shown to be very critical to the intestinal lining\nThe integrity of the lining to the health of the lungs\nAnd so much more so than jumping on R D three gold and maybe using six to ten drops a day if you're under forty\nUsually can absorb this really well if you're over forty than it might be a good idea to put those six to ten drops into\nA half ounces of water and he had two or three of four drops of

eight hundred three Seventy\nThirty four forty seven this eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven All right this is Dr\nBob Marshall pitch Davis has helped my live or answering your\nNutrition and health related calls he reaches toll free triple eight five eight eight Seventy five Seventy six it's go right ahead to the phones let's go to Richard in Boulder, Colorado and he's bloating and wants to track down the source of is intestinal gas so are you there Richard [noise]\nYes I Am doc thanks for taking my call\nHere will come home man or even how much do you I'm\nForty three about one Seventy eight\nThe odds are that the intestinal gas now is from either the gall bladder or your stomach is not able to produce enough hydro Cora gas it and those are the two culprits are normally with intestinal gas does the gas you have to have an older\nWhite as it ever\nOkay well that is going to tell you the fats and proteins are being are rotting and so we now highly suspect they see oh so do you have loading almost immediately after you eat\nIt that's the thing I notice if I'm feeling liquids for example I'm the raw milk fear I don't really seem to have anything any problem with that or else\nOr get stopped by say raw food does not require any digestive enzymes so that I Know no need for a sale or anything so you've got to exclude those we've got to deal with the cooked food okay\nSo yeah so that would have happened is I've been taking ac out take maybe two or three and an actor there mhm I'm immediately after eating and then if I remember I always tried to take it ends up I don't use your and then they have some other than\nThat probably the problem let me tell you why [laughter] well I'm not here to knock anybody else's product but normally when you buy detain hide record it'll contain perhaps and the catalyst that make it work in the stomach\nWe know that when you mix perhaps in with hydro Cora gas it the hydrogen or a gas it slowly destroys the maps and so we put the ... in digest so you need to take a couple of our diet just at the start of the meal now you have pets and\nNow the end of the meal you take the ... and it works like downtown [noise]\nBut I can tell you in the whole world I Am not aware of a single enzyme that works half as good as ours and I'm really I I can tell you with search the earth to get these\nIs a Japanese company that makes these they've been making them since Eighteen Ninety eight they have three airplane hangar sized buildings they supplied China\nThey supplies so much of the world but in America we're manufacturing these and we cannot manufactured to the purity of precision that they can at this time\nSo that is why and what I'm going to say to you Richard as you try ours if you don't think it's the best year ever reuse return it will give you a refund but I'm going to tell you once you get it you're hooked\n[laughter] set in front of called in at a few of them with like the first one or two\nDied just at the start of a meal even if you forget and take it at the end works almost as good in the end you would take a couple of HDL and you know that it's working because there'll be no plaque on your teeth and if you have black on your teeth you know you have low Hedrick or a gadget\nOr the other problem we have is we pass forty and that includes you\nIs that we're facing a real gall bladder crisis in America everybody has something going on with their ... and what we have the news is that much of it is from eating highly heeded\nOils in any food cooked over the boiling point first of all the ... it's a massive white cell response so it's going to make it tired right away 'cause you won't have any red cells left which is what gives you energy\nBut also the body is chasing these because it sees them as a problem\nOkay how old is your sister and how much ... eighty one handed and hasty okay\nWell two things number one is going to be digestion\nIs she on digestive enzymes no well there's no way she has to address fear meal every time she eats the food's rotting\nShow what she needs to do is get on the quantum dodges or something like it will give her ... and ... percent two of those that started a meal in the end of the meal about maybe for the pain had record and now there's no more rotting food\nStep on a game\nAnd step to the ... back\nThose patching laws of hair is almost Fisher linked to the adrenal so you want to get adrenal support and she would need to take about six of those at breakfast and she would years yes and use that I think that yes the news that ain't too much and during that I'm\nNot a cat I wind up kicking pick out for the animal ...\nOnly at breakfast okay okay now\nShe's got to you got to check whether it'd be sure she sleeps five straight hours or more\nThat you got to make sure good then you're going to make sure she is enough water which will be half are waiting ounces of water so Seventy five ounces for a day and she had to build up to that if she don't getting enough\nIs she can increase eight ounces a day once a week\nUntil she gets the water you got to double check salt if she eats all whole food not doesn't buy any processed food then she may need a little air dried sea salt\nOr better yet are pink show that they're dried she's all with the volcanic trace elements added to it so he needs to cover all of these issues if she worries a lot about something she may need some extra be\nAnd all these things will bring her back to the center for the adrenal function okay\nWhat about the ... or\n... that would be if she has to get up at night tier innate like for no reason now castle and she gets off once at night well that's not good\nYeah then ... would be good for may be due capsules a at

yes Tony I I've seen it personally first hand and by the way this week I've had people staying with me that have left the panhandle of Florida because of damage to their homes and because of no no electricity\nAnd your high and dry and Blake one Florida where your base and it's a little bit of a drive for them but I'm sure that they were out of there are very happy to be out of the path of hurricane Michael\n[noise] yeah it was great to have them here you know it's it's great to have people in time and they [noise] so\nThe history of hurricanes you know we're always most worried about the most recent but I mean there's been other devastation going back many years\nYes sir and as Tony ... let's go back to the Galveston hurricane and Nineteen hundred that that hurricane a struck in a year Nineteen hundred and eight thousand deaths from that one hurricane\nWhy livable taxes [noise] certainly experiences some extreme weather at times but the thought of that is amazing hopefully we\nLearn a little bit from each hurricane\nFlorida had a a terrible one though in a way gone way\nBy a certain idea that we call it the ... hurricane of Nineteen twenty eight and came across from West Palm beach\nWhen inland it got a lake Okeechobee it was so strong it created a huge tidal wave across the lake and that killed one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people and that's when they decided to build a dyke around Lake Okeechobee says that will never happen again and that\nWas at a time there weren't many people in Florida Nineteen twenty eight now it would be much worse but as you said the Army Corps of engineers you did something to help out a little bit uh I\nDon't know really interested in fact was the New England hurricane of Eighteen thirty eight and one of the highest wind gust ever recorded and it was a hundred and eighty three miles an hour\nAnd so that that's phenomena that was that strong ... when it hit that in New England the er and then looking at a time when I when I was a kid growing up in Florida we had the hurricane Donna that came in\nThe in the southern part of Florida came up to the states and uh that was Nineteen sixty Donna that went to the middle of the state of Florida came back out on the Atlantic ocean regrouped hit the Carolinas again and then what happened here in New England and when all the way and demanding as hurricane\nThat was in Nineteen sixty one of the longest lasting hurricanes and we look at the miles traveled hurricane strength\nThen of course one that's near and dear to my heart and I know you were there shortly afterwards when talking a bit about it was hurricane Hugo Nineteen eighty nine\nAnd a that was interesting it was ... and I can remember flying there not after\nSeeing so many trees piled up along the road 'cause you just had to push it off the road to get the roads open and they were starting to burn it and that bond fires you know every every quarter mile down the road and that was the first time they had Doppler radar and it really realize that in major hurricanes category three on up three four and five hurricanes\nThey actually produce many tornadoes there was about a hundred and eighty something those recorded by Doppler radar\nOr from hurricane Hugo those only last sixty to hundred and twenty seconds that's when you see damage on one block you go we're kind of looked at the next by what happened there were touched down last last in two minutes ... they were gone you know\nWhere to get back to talking a little bit more about Hugo later because I was one of the ones that are devastated a\nAn area that had such a heavily concentrated number of golf courses in that area so we'll get back and talk about that a little more um one other real oddity was a little bit earlier in the ... century where you had a number of them come across the state of Florida one after the other after the other\nThat was two thousand and four and that was that there was France is Jean and I'm\nCharlie Charlie Charlie France's and Jane they all cost in real estate in a county where I live\nAnd boy they may do destruction we're out there fixing the damage on the golf course and we'll get it fixed and then uh and then another hurricane right here and they say\nThis is a once in a lifetime event or hurricane came you know\nThirty forty five and thirty days later we had another one so there were trees that were were propped up to say that got blown down ... got blown down again uh it it was two thousand and four was unbelievable for the damage it did on golf courses in for [noise]\nFor folks were talking about hurricanes and\nWe're talking about it in a context not just of how they're damage inconveniences golfers who would be like to be playing their favorite golf courses\nAre taught him about it in terms of the economic impact in an industry where so many people depend on golf\nFor their livelihood they're not worried about playing out they're worried about going to their job every day and these golf courses are closed um talked to one particular golf course recently in and they said the only good thing was that when the hurricane hit their property\nThey had sixty ... and they're a force of patties they turn them all into grounds for people and they were able to get on the course and turn it around quickly and reopened because of the help of all and I'm working in the least they got paid during all that they weren't unemployed [laughter] you know that\n... telling the average golf course hires about a hundred a hundred and twenty people\nAnd these are people's livelihoods they need it to ... they need their wages and incomes to buy food you know pay pay the house ran the electric bill all of those things so it's important to ever get the golf courses back up and running because these people depend on their jobs for their livelihood [noise]\nAll right we're talking around golf course architects expert on\nMany of the
