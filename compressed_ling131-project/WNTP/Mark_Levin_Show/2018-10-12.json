I'm going with that one [noise]\nBut first we're going to talk\nAbout what happened yesterday with [noise] Kanye West and the president and how Kanye West has been called Sambo by TI rapper who's not exactly my play list [noise] he's been called a token negro by a pundit on\nCNN [noise] another punted on CNN\nSaid Kanye West quote is what happens when negroes don't read close quote\nAnd when Kanye West mentioned in the oval office that he had some mental issues with bipolar disorder\nThey were laughing I thought this was the networks they cared about people's feelings about mental illness and wanted us to make sure that people who are mentally ill\nSought treatment because after all a lot of the\nRecent gun shootings have been done by people who had some issues and have people been more aware and perhaps and I've been a stigma maybe the gum and might have gotten help I thought that what you thought but I guess not that when it comes to a black renegade\nSomebody who dares to talk about the welfare state in the connection between that and like a father somebody who dares to say that as he said yesterday the issue with guns is not illegal is not legal guns it's illegal guns I have a right to keep and bear arms I was a short conversation wasn't it\n\nInfer Kanye West to suggest that he had an issue because he grew up without a father when the person who sat in that Oval Office for eight years wrote a book about it is difficult relationship with his fog and how he earned his own father and his house I'm Talking about rock Obama\n\nCan isn't that fascinating watching all these people ridicule somebody who has the cash shoes to dare bring up the number one social problem in this country and in a climate change\nIt's a number of people growing up with out fathers and this is an issue that cuts across racial lines although with far more acute and the black community than anywhere else except for Native Americans living on reservations\n\nWalter Williams says you look at census report Eighteen Ninety Nineteen forty a black kid was slightly more likely to be raised\nBy mother and father than a white kid so\nPerhaps it's overdue for us to maybe have a discussion about whether or not the welfare status undermined\nMy father used to say people are motivated by two things promise to gain and fearful loss and my father lifelong Republicans said about Democrats they want to give you something for nothing and when you try and get something for nothing you almost always end up getting nothing for something\nMaybe just me and my dad was right\nWhen they have a discussion about it no no no it was just ridiculous guy\nPie I actually used to a record with him did something with them and now says I'm embarrassed to work with you you don't have a discussion about this became they have a talk about this [noise] here's what gets me\nOver on MSNBC her there were ridiculing him and ridiculing him regularly [noise] do you know what the most watched cable network for blacks is MSNBC and I've read that MSNBC hall\nAbout thirty percent of the ratings come from black viewers you just the top\nCable channel watched by blacks in America and that is why you have people like Chris Matthews constantly constantly putting out the race card only to admit when it's gone down\nThey just believe it how do I know that ... is what he said day before yesterday listened very carefully\nBy do understand President Trump to it as much as any of us do he always used the phone he does that say they've done the thing and they get in a contest of ideas and politics than the other people don't do area sitting with a hip hop guy who apparently is has gotten some sort of bizarre\nAnd this was just yesterday this is Chris Matthews explaining why and his view a Kanye West was invited to the oval office\nOr politics that Doug Fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the idea that he's a racist it runs against the either Trump dislike minorities that he's going after her Ronan going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects if you get your comes it will in politics\nAnd it's sort of a racial way and areas flipping it can be used in people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most them if they think they're racist\nDid you hear that mostly he invited Kanye West in the oval office for white people because white people most of them won't vote for somebody if they think he's a racist says Chris Matthews if that's what you believe and why is that you were constantly saying things like that when he said\nToday America First there was not just the racial I mean they are but I should say racial the Hitler areas of backgrounds of course nothing about human rights something about gender rice says things that here from a Democrat and Russia\nA serious thing did you notice anything sort of ethnic about his attitude and answering your question something wasn't it wasn't it said something about they have all their three hundred and some executions in Texas and they were on Syria I remember that was something that permit predated Trump but clearly and say I think you think it is I\nMean what is it going after the football players father I mean uh I I don't get it he just seems like there's a certain aspect he likes to go for people of color or sometimes I I notice a pattern I'm Sorry I notice it why is it brings out into it as an added to the ethics each of the racial thing should be ...
