Florida Republicans are running a quote overtly racial campaign against Gillum here's another pundits saying that the Republicans are trying to turn the Florida governor race into a race war\nQuote it is and I think the Republican campaign the racist Republican campaign speaks to that\nAs Cornell talked about a unless they make this ... this campaign if you will on racial terms unless they turned it into a race war we've seen Andrew Gillum over and over again refused to take the bait he's running a unifying campaign turn it into a race war and talking about what he wants to do for all of the people the state of ...\nAnd the noble ripped mold democratic candidate is refusing to take the bait like when his opponent Rhonda Santas use the term monkey and rather than say was just a regular expression that people use he went\nWell I ... I I Am an implied was racial\nMe my order while the Republican Party and his Republican opponent Rhonda Santa's continue to try and bring this down why\nAre they doing this it's very simple please explain the white electorate in Florida yeah goes eighty twenty four yeah we're on to say at this and they can make this race and defined it always disgusting racial tropes that they're trying to unfortunately that will be enough to win however\nDisgusting racial tropes\nBurke if they can keep those margins down we know people will call we're going to turn out much higher numbers because they're in ... excited and enthused by the given Canada said so that's not going to be an issue or concern on the Democratic side\nBut I I thought there was voter suppression here you are saying the minority vote turnout is going to be large high\nThought they were being suppressed\nEyes but if the Republicans can make this a race war which is what they're trying to do not so subtly then I think not even subtle\nThat their calculus for how they win this election but it's reprehensible and I think the voters of the state of Florida of all colors need to ask themselves are we going to fall for

but first\nThe president is you know in Ohio referred to General Robert he we as a great general refer to Ulysses ... an incredible that part was left out and NBC had an issue or a correction\nAnd Trump was not wrong about grand here as a trigger university on Ulysses S crap\nHere was Eighteen sixty to America was in the jets the civil war\nLooking back it's easy to believe that a union victory was inevitable\nThat north had more money more population more industry but no one thought that at the time\nIn the first year of the war it looked as if the south would win a series of high profile victories in the east convinced many that confederates were better fighters under better leaders where with President Lincoln signed a battlefield general who can do for the union what Roberts Lee was doing for the confederacy lead into victory\nThe man he found the man who save the union was delicious esque grant he wasn't Lincoln's first choice or second or third\nIn fact when the war started in Nineteen sixty one Lincoln had no idea who you listen to grant was hardly surprising since at the time grant was selling hats to farmers wives in a small town in Illinois\nHis rise to glory as one of the most amazing stories in American history born in Ohio on April twenty seventh Eighteen twenty to grant had no ambition to be a soldier\nHis father pushed him into it thinking he wasn't suited for much else\nGrants West Point career wasn't especially distinguished either but during the Mexican American War Eighteen forty six to Eighteen forty eight grant proved himself to be an officer of unusual ability he was cool under fire daring but rarely reckless even more important than men under his command trusted him\nAfter that war grant returned to St Louis to marry his fiance Julie a dent the daughter of a slave owning Missouri farmer grant was never happier than when he was with Julia and he was never been happier than when he was not unfortunately in this period army life force them to be separated sometimes for many months\nTo assuage is loneliness grant started to drink while in a distant posting in northern California a thousand miles from Julia his drinking got the better of him he resigned his army condition to avoiding embarrassing court martial\nIt was downhill from there one business venture failing after another by Eighteen sixty thoroughly humiliated and with no money and no prospects he was back working for his father in a small town of Galena, Illinois\nThen the civil war happened the union was in desperate need of experienced soldiers grant volunteered his leadership skills were immediately obvious he quickly advanced through the ranks\nIn a little more than six months he scored two major victories at Fort Henry Ford Donaldson along the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers he followed these up with victory in the largest battle in American history up to that time the battle of Shiloh making him a true union hero in a cause that was starved for heroes [noise]\nThere was nothing flashy about grants general ship all he did was when unlike the overly cautious generals that drove President Lincoln to distraction grants battle plan was to always move forward always put pressure on his foes any advantage to union hat and technology are manpower he employed to the fullest\nLike Napoleon ... was a superb breeder of maps he could identify the enemies vulnerabilities and exploit them as he did in his brilliant Eighteen sixty three campaign for Vicksburg a campaign that is still studied at war colleges\nIn March Eighteenth sixty four Lincoln made grant commander of all the union armies it took more than a year of the wars hardest fighting before least surrendered and the war finally came to an end\nBy this point the president and his general had developed a close bond shortly after grant return to Washington Lincoln invited the grants to join him in Mary Lincoln at Ford's Theatre\nGrant excepted Julia however had developed an intense dislike for Mary Lincoln and insisted that her husband get out of the commitment embarrassed grant did that\nIn the intelligence Lincoln's server them talk\n[noise] [noise]\nLet me take this moment to

has surrendered her security clearance\nWe didn't get it all goes back of course of the state department's ongoing review of the mishandling of classified information related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server\nAnd it also kind of gives you an idea of how slow some things moving government because almost a year and a\nHalf ago the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican Chuck Grassley sent a letter to the state department asking about the status of Hillary Clinton security clearance in that letter Grassley stated that any government workers who possibly engaged\nIn such serious offenses ... at the very minimum have their security clearances suspended\nBending an investigation well three weeks ago the state department finally responded to Senator Grassley twenty Seventeen letter saying quoting here\nAt her record as former Secretary Clinton security clearance was administratively was drawn on August thirty is twenty eight teams the letter went on to say\nThat on September twenty it's the security clearances of five other Clinton researchers had also been ... vote only Clinton a Cheryl Mills was listed the other foreign names were redacted of course at the time of the pro\nHillary Clinton was running for president and no charges were filed this summer President Trump revoked the security clearance a former CIA director John Brennan\nAnd at the time the White House said it was reviewing the clearances of several other people so about Seventeen months after Grassley sent a letter he finally got a response from the state department\nSo it looks as if we did a preemptive strike by surrendering her security clearance as opposed to having good revoked Byron York as a conservative writer and a Fox News contributor\nOf a key issue of course a in her a sacred email server was that uh she did send classified information uh\nOver this unclassified basically an secured a system and there's really no doubt about that I suppose you could argue whether it was super important stuff or not but the the fact that it was classified she did send it in a casual way over and an secured system seems pretty much beyond dispute now\nNow speaking of Hillary Clinton did bill abused his power because of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky the Internet there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why\nAn adult but let me ask you this where the investigation of the current income than against him numerous allegations had been made\nWow you see your husband was not investigated because he had an affair and the oval office with being investigated for white water\nAnd they came up during the investigation and he would not have been impeached hitting not lie about it\nUnder oath\nAnd which he dismisses denies and ridicules hell there was an investigation and it as I Believe came out in the right place\nAnd once again Hillary was not ask about the allegation made by the way that you write survivor named Juanita Broderick the two weeks after the alleged rape by\nBill Clinton you Hillary Clinton Berkeley intimidated her that somehow never came up to that to the\nMen the Kavanaugh hearing also turned attention back to the me too movement which complicates Clinton's place in women's history\nIn the Nineteen nineties she stood by her husband Bill Clinton as he denied allegations of sexual harassment and assault\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct check out her answer\nWhat role did you play and orchestrating the nuts or slug strategy against bills conclusion accusers you were accused of being the ringleader and a book by Barbara Olson called hell to pay you were accused of being a ringleader in a book by Christopher Hitchens called no one left ally to what role did you play doesn't listen to her answer\nNone no roe unbelievable unbelievable we Hitler reclaiming on she said she was a ringleader\nBut when the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no no no I take responsibility for my life and my answer [noise] on the the [noise] what about\nWhat we need a project said two weeks after all if you really intimidated her what about that\nHat on for a minute\nOkay so that's what I was going to have because you know you kind of\nKnow it was from the get on this\nOn your age or reach African\nAnd I I don't know you know I uh [noise]\nWhat I mentioned he did a rap

rappers like comment and TI and\nJay Z oh darn Brazil way down on ... um when she's not revealing the questions for debate I guess you have time to observe popular culture\nBased on this is an

American part Cherokee part Delaware took a DNA test and according to the Boston Globe fall off it shows that she is in fact part Native American\nThe Boston Globe article said quote the vast majority holding a professor from Stanford professor Carlos Bustamante from Stanford\n\nWhich of course and we look up and find out what Carlos Bustamante studies of what he specializes in I'm presuming I'm presuming he's a geneticist but let's make sure which anything is sociologist I'm just kidding I have no idea what do you have to find out Carlos Bustamante\nStanford says this is the possibility she had a Native American ancestor anywhere from six to ten generations ago\nAlthough the vast majority he says her ancestry is European but the the results quote strongly support the existence of an on an ad mixed Native American ancestry close quote\nCalculating that her pure American Native American ancestry appears in the family tree and the range of six depend generations ago which would make her approximately one\nOne thousand and twenty fourth Native American\nAlso get this study was based not on Native American DNA but on Mexican Peruvian at Columbia and DNA\n\nNevertheless CNN headline Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence close quote their words of Native American ancestry daily based also left wing publication Elizabeth Warren fights Trump's Pocahontas taught with DNA test proving Native American\nGroups called quote really is that when it proves one one thousand and twenty four that means the percentage of Native American\nAncestry and her is actually lower than the average in America\n\nIs he claims he ever got any sort of benefit by claiming to Native American kid with CBS says\nMassachusetts Senator Kennedy was born on Wednesday sought to explain the controversial decision to west herself as a Native American in a directory of law professors for nearly a decade before getting a job at Harvard and said she is absolutely qualify for her job in the quote that was years ago\nProponents of time accused her of quote participating in Harvard diversity Sam close go by allowing the school to lift her as a minority\n\nLocal directory\nTouted her Native American roots in the late Nineteen eighties early Nineteen nineties\n\nAnd according to a former chairman of American law association of law schools\nThey directory once served as a tip sheet for administrators looking to and identify minority professors so she lives in ... in this book knowing full well she's going to get an advantage it turns out the amount of Native American ancestry and her is actually probably less than mine and yours\n[noise] in fact\nTruth be told I have a a mother whose father very light skinned gray hair I understand his parents were also very light scan and I believe my mother went even said that sometimes they could even pass for white\nWhich would probably indicates that I have probably more European Caucasian blood in me than it was it lives with Warren has a Native American ancestry and her\nNow considering all my life I call myself a black person or therefore for the last ... years\nAnd I'm just thinking this through so stay with me here\nFor the last ... years I looked at myself as a black person which means I have therefore failed to benefit from the white privilege that I was entitled to\nSo it seems to me there ought to be some sort of reparations for black people who have more white blood white ancestry in them that he lived with Warren has of Native American Cherokee and Delaware and her and therefore I'm old all of the lack of my having benefited from white privilege for all these years\nSince white people all benefit from white privilege to seems to me the people that could have been designated as white who didn't do so given the standard is pretty low one one thousand\nIt seems to me I'm going to money over here and I'm thinking about Obama now here's where it gets complicated that's what I'm saying we're we're we're we're altogether thinking this through the collectively given the new standards were learning from Elizabeth Warren who now wants Donald Trump to pay up\nDonald Trump once said he give a million dollars to her favorite charity I should take a DNA test she now claims to protest wants to come to pay us so we have the new one thousand uh\nTwenty fourth standard now Obama is a descendant from a Kenyan his father was a kitten a and a Kenyan was one of the states that whose treat ... tribal chieftains sold off captured slaves are in the slavery\n'em and Obama's a mother distance from people living in Kansas who I understand owned slaves so Obama\nDescend from slave owners on his mom's side enslaved sell it on his dad's side so I'm thinking\nMan owes me some reparations over here given the standard we now have here so if if the dog gets very confusing and I'm a sheet now now if it gets worse\nShe didn't say I have they didn't ancestry she said her mother\nAnd father had to wear your low because their mom was Cherokee and Delaware and her father's racist parents wouldn't have her she didn't talk about ... generations ago so she [noise] I don't

I Would think knowledge you're feeling a little little American that there are none of the nation has left the most vulnerable\nHelp her out there and then a station has been about Wall Street and not about average American would you apologize for the state and I think if it were conservative but I was calling the president\nRemains riveted George Bush let people die on rooftops because they were poor and because they were black\nThat would I Would think knowledge in what Americans believe that you stand by and I am\nAbsolutely that's what Americans believe now I don't really think that race is that if people think and\nMaybe I should have had it that way pen said that it another way um\nProbably shouldn't says another way but the feelings are real\nDropped me not a problem and\nAnd if and if she suffered anything from it if the media brings it up I never heard George W. Bush let people die on rooftops in New Orleans because they were poor and because they were black and by the way George Bush said that when Kanye West said this George Bush doesn't care about black people you're one of the lowest moments of his presidency\nI appreciate that I that I don't appreciate it now it's one thing to say you know our appreciate delays analyst business so they said this massive racist I resent it it's not true and there's one most disgusting moments of my brothers\nAnd notice he was talking about what kind of us that he didn't say anything about what Sarah McCaskill said she said the same thing in fact it was worse George W.

biology at Stanford so I guess he's well qualified now what he's concluded is achieved one one thousand\nNative American and when the anchors over at MSNBC horror mocking you that's when you know you look ridiculous check out what the quick melt and said\nI'm a battle is going to talk about politicians who who who gained something\nDid you gain anything by by putting out this new DNA that's where I can gather according to your papers reporting sheen one one thousand or something like I mean I I think I'm going to\nWhen when you want to get a left wing persons John tightened Dan Weber asked him or her who's going to pay for it who's going to pay back who's gonna pay for thirty two trillion dollars over ten years\nYeah that's right and in addition to that you're going to have rationing\nPeople say oh well Canada and Great Britain have great plants everyone should keep this number like twenty two weeks that's how long it takes for a major surgery and Canada\nAfter they examined you may take months but you have been examined and now after they say yes you need this major surgery twenty two weeks average wait a lot of those people cross over the border and they get their operations in America\nAnd wherever is my guest founder and CEO of a Mac ... association of mature American citizens now Dan I'm probably mangled this guy's name but I Know the father of the Canadian health care system in Canada is named Claude Gaston way or something like that and he won that sounded a in Quebec and all the other provinces ultimately adopted it\nShe still lives are as far as I Know in his nineties and he's come out and recently said\nThat I was wrong we should have had more competition I should not have outlawed private care and he pronounced the healthcare system or Internet in Canada pretty much a failure\nYeah yeah and well we just got to look at all socialize looking at a cute but they don't even have a aspirin available in the local drugstores look at Venezuela\nThey are socialized the medical care thinking doctors were any too much and now the poor people literally dying and it's a shame socialism doesn't work because the socialism the individual man's nothing\n[noise] then I'm often asked people this question whenever I have a discussion about this Canada Great Britain they have a\nA socialized medicine Canada has the what I think Obama wants to have which is single payer in Great Britain has something very similar but when you take polls the majority of citizens in both Canada and Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a snapple they can go into the local clinic that may wait in line a long time but to go to a local clinic gotta get taken care of it it won't be any money out of their pocket\nUntil they have a serious problem not only that the recovery race after cancer operations at the heart operations because of the way they rushed the medical care\nThere's much less survival in Canada and Great Britain compared to the U.S was something depending on the type of cancer\nWere somewhere between twenty and thirty percent higher survival rates because it's not a machine like they have over there well you march in your march out you're a number you know establish relationship with the doctor it's horrible system or we don't need it and America\nMy guess is Dan wherever founder and CEO of ... association of mature American citizens and we only have about ... seconds left with ideas and a Mack have on how to reduce costs of health care all\nWe got to use free enterprise for example we have a bill in Congress now with nine co sponsors age are fifty eight fifty six listening to this so called the seven million people for free\nWe give doctors local doctors can take a simple tax deduction for treating a patient for free [noise]\nThat'll cost the government about fifty bucks for the tax deduction for the doctor versus somebody on Medicaid who goes to the ER as a
