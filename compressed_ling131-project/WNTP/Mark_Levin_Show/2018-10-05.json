details because this remains a confidential part of the background report I Hope that uh changes are made and we'll be able to talk more about what the FBI\nDid later but what I can say is it the most\nNotable part of this report\nIs what's not in it as we noted by the White House the FBI I did not interview for Kavanaugh nor did the FBI interview doctors lazy for\nShockingly Dianne Feinstein feels that the FBI report is an adequate as does senator Coons\nI think it's going to be very close um I think um there's a number of senators both Republican and Democrat who haven't\nYet the senator they did the deal with with like and I said at the time watch Coons then say oh it wasn't it wasn't adequate enough wasn't there on up it should have taken more time\nMade public what their final

you get into a situation where you're giving Medicare to people who are sixteen and twenty five and thirty a ... instead of reserving it for the senior citizens of actually paid for it\nI mean this is this is one of the the biggest thing that we have to talk about the nobody is actually talking about the thank you for bringing up this Medicare for all the expected costs for that is thirty seven trillion dollars\nThat are currently in the ... billion trillion so thirty seven thousand billion dollars I\nMean it's it's it's absolutely over ten years writes it so there's no end of that sustainable what's going to end up happening is Medicare for all the medicine or not right as far as I'm concerned is going to be the same thing that happened with Obamacare\nYou're basically setting up and that's going to impose on it because it did not survive that way we're going to eventually go back exactly where the Democrats want to go which is a single payer system period\nOkay rain now

across the country at closed up almost entirely and\nOh you know people are very upset with what went on there and at the end the you know honestly this entire election Michael we we're we're kind of like the big choice election right and voters are going to have to make the choice or going to have to vote for Republicans\nCan build on this economic opportunity right and can improve the lives of

[noise] it means the lesson meteor hits the earth\nTomorrow Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed as the next justice of the Supreme Court now [noise] I Want to say something to those of you\nWho have no problem saying all women should be believed all men should not be believed for those of you who felt that it's perfectly OK to accuse somebody who's had up until now impeccable reputation\nOf a sexual assault without any corroborating witnesses corroborating evidence\nAnd that's not to say and I never have said and I defy you to find when I have said that Dr Christine Blasey Ford has a liar I've never said that I Do think something happened to her is not my job to determine what happened to her though it's my job to determine whether or not\nWe we have fairness here and as Susan Collins pointed out this is not a jury trial so it's not a standard beyond a reasonable doubt but certainly it's got to be more likely than not which is what she said\n\nAnd given his reputation given the number of women that have vouch for his reputation given that nobody's ever made a kind of allegation before given that he's now already gone seven background checks given that the for people to talk to Ford say where they're all say they have no recollection of it that does not meet the standard of more likely than not\n\nFor those of you who were yelling and screaming berating people migrating\nSenator Flake look at me look at me look at me\nFor those of you who believe that just because I'm applying this more likely than not standard therefore I Believe that Dr Ford is lying they believe in a sexual abuse harassment and assault or not serious problems in America we haven't been listening\nFor those of you who took up on this issue [noise] not really so much because you're concerned about the issue because you want to stick at the Trump because as I told you the primary reason that people are afraid about Kevin is because they believe you overturn roe v Wade\nNot listen to me very carefully somehow some way this country function until Nineteen Seventy three with every individual state determining gets laws on abortion in states like\nNew York California in fact in states where Seventy percent of the population resides had an abortion pretty much on demand and there's no reason to believe that if and when roe v Wade or to be overturned and no matter goes back to the states\nThe landscape would shift in a sort of dramatic way right now in conservative states you will not be able to find an abortion doctor they'd been shamed out of business\nAnd in ... states April the way we're overturn what makes you think the state legislatures would suddenly enact anti abortion laws given their unpopularity in those states so in the real world\nNot a whole lot what change now how and why Robie way became known as a quote right to an abortion case it's beyond me\n\nAnd if you look at the LA Times article not Fox at Breitbart National Review came out a few years ago about the opening of the papers of just as black man he was the signer of the author of the decision\nAnd he thought I was going to be a very narrow decision\nHe thought that the decision on whether or not women should have an abortion was a medical decision one that should be made by doctors and he almost issued a warning that the decision are not be ... be construed any other way she was talked out of it\n\nAnd so for those of you who have turned this into a man gets woman thing just because everything that you dislike in Donald Trump\nEverything he does everything he says you're going to attack it because you think evoke or because you think he's a bigot because you think he's a racist because you think this because you think that gets wet to approval ratings are up\n... percent according to Rasmussen guess what the enthusiasm gap between Democrats\nAnd Republicans used to be ten points just about a week or two ago is now plus two in favor Democrats\nGuess what the attack\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh the fact that some leftist have refer to him as a attempted rape is for a serial rapist\nIs quoted a backlash and that backlash is going to motivate Republicans even when Kavanaugh gets on because\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't you care about how she ... got to her position\nShe said she spent more time on this went over hundreds of cases a was a brief to she said I think once a week by some a group of legal experts so she could understand what this was all about\nAnd she very carefully went over Christine forced testimony and very sensitive Lee said as I said before that uh that she believes her she believes something happen before we can assign what happened to her to Kavanaugh has got to be fairness\nAnd while this is not a criminal trial and therefore you don't apply their standard of beyond a reasonable doubt into a moral certainty certainly it's got to be at least more likely than the nod and she went over the evidence in such a name for people\nWho she claims were were there and the four people have no recollection of it or say they weren't there and now now what do you do with that\nAnd ... also said that the person who who took her to the party or or or brought her back a has never shown up she got home somehow she didn't fly she didn't say that about didn't fly I added that but um she got home somehow and whoever it is we got her home never came forward and told us\nWho here she was and so given the background of having all the reputation of Kavanaugh all the women that have supported him all the women he's worked with with no allegation\nAnd we're going to deny him a seat on the Supreme Court because a woman who cannot corroborate her claim of doesn't really know the year doesn't really know where does know how she got there is no how she got back didn't tell anybody\nShe said that just doesn't fast past the fundamental fairness tests and everything she said it was reasonable she's a moderate but the women in the bottom right hand corner apparently weren't listening or have turned it off or felt that\nSomehow it didn't make any sense I mean did you hear what you had to say\nDoes not matter that you want people to think through how about you wanted to be an FBI investigation for that you have more confidence that Dr Ford allegation had been thoroughly bet if you weren't even listening [noise]
