virtuous really and man and the fact that he could sit there\nAnd answer the main question from the inferior mines was just\nI was blessed to become the fire chief in Atlanta on the thin layer Shirley Franklin and I'm In ah twenty months after serving her I was appointed to the United states are much destruction on the ministry and the president of Iraq Obama and I was there for just\nUnder a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta by the honorable America's same read in two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this is this whole story your story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success\nHow how is it you ended up whether you are say or terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\nWell a\nA year prior to my termination I had published a book that I had written on my own time and self published for Christian men the book was called\nWho told you that you were neck and if the question that got ask Adam in the garden to eat and ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with genesis chapter three birth eleven so\nUh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcoming the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was suspended ah but the reason why I was terminated this was a cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purpose for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between a husband and wife and holy matrimony and that in his sex outside of that a is a thin and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOK Now let's get this straight you have these opinions which your opinions and literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men in the fire department where you\nAre not at all so ... it was it the fact is you self published the book you had and use public funds what business is it of the city of Atlanta\nFor the mayor of the city council or anybody or what's the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument for using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city's views are and that I can have those views as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city\nOr I had an obligation to check those beliefs that the door is what one council members fit and the mayor clearly supported that dish\nOkay at this point ah this I think most people are listening to us or slapping their forehead and think this is just clearly unjust and when people suffer injustice or discrimination\nOr a really an assault against their religious liberties or freedom
