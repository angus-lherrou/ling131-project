Americans left right Democrat Republican\nHe's ... he's been publicist or was at the time for a Russian for the son of the Russian oligarch we pop star remember I've done a lot of investigating and do Trump Tower I find that the Russians there are highly connected to fusion GPS\nActually had dinner I had dinner at the day before the day of the day after with using GPS which finance which put out the dust ca financed by Hillary financed by the DNC and then also even more than that I found out one of the participants\nTook a train in the morning with a Hillary associate the work with using GPS and then that with him right after the meeting so many questions here let's get immediately to my recorded interview wish you are now going to hear in full with your publicist Rob Goldstone who set up demeaning who was a witness to the Trump Tower meeting\nAndme or take a listen\nThe Trump Tower meeting so much intrigued us so many questions and\nReally is so much information one way and or and the other but actually we're joined right now\nBy individuals who was inside the tower during the meeting and more than that actually his email a famously started at least in the media the whole Trump Tower issue and so I joined me is the author of but I recently read this book is called\nHow in email trumped my life and really that title is very accurate from what I understand\nA subtitle is pop stars pageants and presidents are Rob Goldstone who is the publicist who sent the email or to Donald Trump junior again how an email trumped my life available on Amazon dot com\nRob Goldstone a welcome to air inclined investigative radio\nHey Eric nice to be a\nSource so you know I almost don't even know where to begin with this because we can begin with a\nTrump Tower meeting we can begin with the email\nWe can begin because I read your book we can even began in Moscow in two thousand Thirteen so so why don't we jump around let's start with and I know we should start with the email but let's start with\nThe Trump Tower meeting June two thousand and six team or if you can take us inside them and first of all a\nWho was in the meeting that you can recall\nFor you know it's interesting I was just listening to you and your introduction\nAnd it made me think of something a friend that says to me over the last year which is um I watch the Woody Allen movie ballet and I don't know if you've seen that but it's where the man sort of morph into all these historical places and suddenly appeared\nAnd suddenly those I mean I'm kind of Robert ... valley like every time you mention something oh I Would do that like Trump Tower meeting I was in the email that with me most go with me so bizarre ... on many levels which we should do but going for something from town meeting\nThe most important thing for me was the fact that I Would never supposed to be that as people who read the email and the you know the ... the ... and you know my job was really to get to mutate and uh after that I was to hand it off\nAnd it was one of those of that storm type event that\nWhen a when I ... the people who were coming to the meeting one of them who I'd met before I ... who works for my clients family to me rub you you've met don't junior before when you take cars up so he introduced me to the Russian at seven in the ...\nGuy hold on just to the scene here is this uh where where is this happening this and the longer you're out on the hour exactly in\nThe lobby Trump Tower and so he comes in with the Taliban and the guy who would be a need for whom the meeting was full\nAnd she has brought with her a translator\nAnd the college I took no no to the who or what they were\nI merely said hopefully you have ID and we don't get stuck in six your say um I got them through security and I took them up that uh we waited a few minutes and they they were like sort of get the tourists taking photos out of the window the Trump Tower and so the than it was all but the real really\nEven though the view it quite spectacular and dumb junior came a couple of minutes later and because I met him a couple of times the came over to be shipped by hand I\nIntroduced him to bite who I met people who will be idle our oaks representative my clients represents the [noise] and I was getting ready to leave and don't said to me hey why don't you just sit in and you can take them out of the ad it'll only be a short meeting anyway\nAnd I took that to me last week squeezed in the neat thing wouldn't it be good if you with that so you could be kind of the people out at the end and I thought it was a pretty fair require selected not a problem\nSo okay I just want to set the tone here because there's so much information being thrown around and so first of all so you're in the Trump Tower a lobby and then uh you're with like who I understand\nOn as you said ... works for ... the Russian billionaire although guards and also the sun but specifically the the real estate company of ah the the all of\nA ...\nBut then also outside with you I turns out is hardly a vessel and this guy I but then with her\nIs three not a ... who is a Russian lobbyists to works along with her\nTo counter what's known as the Magnitsky Act which sanctions Russian officials over the alleges that the death of a tax accountant\nAnd then also is a ... and a Antonio or some some core of salt and it'd be learning something different so he's out there with you\nAnd he's the translator or in a totally out\nSo you guys all go up a and we're going to get to the email where this whole thing is set up so so you go up and we were in Trump Tower do you go into is is this a conference from home for sure yes and losing their\nLaw and then when we go in there is a poll manifold and with the time with the chairman of the Trump campaign and ... our coach now I'm ... I'm sure most people do\nAnd I'm Don junior and myself and this group of Russian with bipolar them and that was it you know I sat next to Jared Kushner a whole ... June ... ton of the head of the table I don't put the with the group of ... of Russia and the town that\n[noise] so okay and we're going to get to the email on a bit but the email did say that\nUm that the meeting was offered to provide quote the Trump campaign which some official documents and information would incriminate Hillary\nAnd her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father meaning to Don juniors father you sent this to you centers to Don Don junior or to set the whole meeting up you're outside you go and so let's get to the actual content as you remember ed of of the meeting first of all who did the talking [noise]\nSo the smoking was ... was mostly done by Italian ... guy only pet food with don't junior welcoming every body\nAnd uh as you hear about acquaintance you won't he asked the crowd to present whatever it was she had to say I'm an and I should say that I Would I hop a narrow because I Know it's hard for people to understand but I really didn't care about with me in the ... my job was to get the nice thing\nI found myself in that kind of by the phone I was checking my email about what the when I was keeping often they're opening case to be on it the case or something that would interest\n[laughter] so um I you know well known versus the politics I'm not stupid so I thought if there was something that kind of smoking gun or something of an trip I wouldn't know see if I didn't recognize the wording or the frightening\nThing or or what it meant I Would see a change in policy line which I think people react differently if they if they get excited\nBy something so don't introduced a a daughter that's how it to introduce what it was she had to say and she stopped talking about how\nPeople like Bill Browder who I've never heard of under this brother who I've never heard of we're making large donations to the Democratic campaign bald\nThat tend to do which was Hillary Clinton and how outrageous as well because that would tax food do you want to do something about invasion of taxes and these were very they seem like very general remarks about how kind of outrage was that the type of people would may be donations\nAnd by the way I also want to point out that this time this was two thousand sixteen everything that you just said wasn't not only a matter of public record it was very well known that\nA bill Browder was a donor to the Democratic party under the ... of Clinton so that's not exactly incriminating information and in fact it's information was already all over the media um so what would you consider you say\nThat yes I think it was known to everyone except me meant nothing to me I'd also never heard of ... the I'd never heard of the act\nSo to me was was was like ... what it did seem to be with not terribly interesting and when she was talking in these very general terms about them donated to Democrats I remember looking over in don't Judy direction and kind of smiling to myself and picking\nIt's going to tell you the best and the guy at the fed\nThe ... I Want to offer that through the ... the bill Browder do like the Democrat they should be paying back the isn't that awful she would never bothered me think that ever ever but if you keep the question Bob if you kind of\nColonel too that it in a bit of mystery and just say it's damaging information the information about Hillary become a Russian funding but it's always the brow to this\nDay I'll be I'll protect the Magnitsky Act so that food to me people miss the switch but it's all part of the same thing so that young so that I Would give you yeah she did could then ... had been presented to me as I never said the will use that word ... on the campaign\nBut it was generic and as you say it was even public right but I don't think that not to to what I think not to do\nWith getting face time with the campaign to talk about what she was a page lobbyists full which was to try and lift sanctions for the Magnitsky Act [noise] and I just want to say one more thing all the\nSort of set up a light in my mind when I watched um Donald Trump ... the ...\nOn the TV in in how the kitty and suddenly ... mentioned the Magnitsky Act mentioned bill Browder and I thought at that time\n... there's some of the season in significant lobbying it important to him so cool she would try and get this amazing and I think the reason the meeting because I'm so kind of a wound up than they thought I did the mystery of how the government or what it what\nIt's all part of this thing in the very people that she believes she had an a quote someone else who would do it all\nWith Bill Browder under this or that was how did the same thing it just walked the presents about what\nThe media has harped on this meeting repeatedly to claim that this was evidence of collusion between the Russian government and on and the Trump campaign and collusion what they're talking about here\nIs an attempt to steal an election these are very uh is serious charges is accurate and all ... on it it's funny minute meeting\nWith a Russian attorney and other people who as you just said I'm we're speaking with Rob Goldstone was inside them eating and set it up\nOr they did not present themselves as working on behalf of the Russian government collusion is a serious thing I mean again colluding to steal an election so you were inside the entire time you listen to every word or you know you say you kinda tuned out because it was boring\nBut I Would assume that if if what the Russian government work colluding with the Trump campaign to steal an election\nObviously you would remember that so when you

Trump was not wrong about ... here's a predator university on Ulysses S grid\nHere was Eighteen sixty to America was in the depths of the civil war\nLooking back it's easy to believe that a union victory was inevitable\nThe north had more money more population more industry but no one thought that at the time\nIn the first year of the war it looked as if the south would win a series of high profile victories in the east convinced many that confederates were better fighters under better leaders where with President Lincoln signed a battlefield general who can do for the union what Robert de ... was doing for the confederacy lead into victory\nThe man he found the man who save the union was delicious ask grant he wasn't Lincoln's first choice or second or third\nIn fact when the war started in Nineteen sixty one Lincoln had no idea who you listen to grant was hardly surprising since at the time grant was selling hats to farmers wives in a small town in Illinois\nHis rise to glory as one of the most amazing stories in American history born in Ohio on April twenty seventh Eighteen twenty to grant had no ambition to be a soldier\nHis father pushed him into it thinking he wasn't suited for much else\nGrants West Point career wasn't especially distinguished either but during the Mexican American War Eighteen forty six to Eighteen forty eight grant proved himself to be an officer of unusual ability he was cool under fire daring but rarely reckless even more important than men under his command trusted him\nAfter that war grant returned to St Louis to marry his fiance Julia Dent the daughter of a slave owning Missouri farmer grant was never happier than when he was with Julia and he was never been happier than when he was not unfortunately in this period army life force them to be separated sometimes for many months\nTo assuage is loneliness grant started to drink while in a distant posting in northern California a thousand miles from Julia his drinking got the better of him he resigned his army condition to avoiding embarrassing court martial\nIt was downhill from there one business venture failing after another by Eighteen sixty thoroughly humiliated and with no money and no prospects he was back working for his father in a small town of Galena, Illinois\nThen the civil war happened\nFor union was in desperate need of experienced soldiers grant volunteered his leadership skills were immediately obvious he quickly advanced through the ranks\nIn a little more than six months he scored two major victories at Fort Henry in Fort Donaldson along the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers he followed these up with victory in the largest battle in American history up to that time the battle of Shiloh making him a true union hero in a cause that was starved for heroes [noise]\nThere was nothing flashy about grants general ship all he did was when unlike the overly cautious generals that drove President Lincoln to distraction grant battle plan was to always move forward always put pressure on his foes any advantage to union hat and technology are manpower he employed to the fullest\nLike Napoleon grant was a superb breeder of maps he could identify the enemies vulnerabilities and exploit them as he did in his brilliant Eighteenth sixty three campaign for Vicksburg a campaign that is still studied at war colleges\nIn March Eighteenth sixty four Lincoln made grant commander of all the union army it took more than a year of the wars hardest fighting before Li surrendered and the war finally came to an end\nBy this point the president and his general had developed a close bond shortly after grant return to Washington Lincoln invited the grants to join him in Mary Lincoln at Ford's Theatre\nGrant accepted Julia however had

Hillary Clinton has surrendered her security clearance\nAnd any of this all goes back of course of the state department's ongoing review of the mishandling of classified information related to Hillary

committee\nRepublican Chuck Grassley sent a letter to the state department asking about the status of Hillary Clinton security clearance in that letter Grassley stated that any government workers who possibly engaged in such serious offenses who would at the very minimum have their security clearances suspended\nPending investigation well three weeks ago the state department and finally responded

director John Brennan\nAnd at the time the White House said it was reviewing the clearances of\nSeveral other people so about Seventeen months after Grassley sent a letter he finally got a response from the state department\nSo it looks as if we did a preemptive strike by surrendering her security clearance as opposed to having good revoke Byron York is a conservative writer and a Fox News contributor\nOf a key issue of course a in her a secret email server was that uh she did send classified information\nOr over this unclassified basically an secured a system and there's really no doubt about that I suppose you could argue whether it was super important stuff or not but the the fact that it was classified\nShe did send it and they casual way over and an secured system seems pretty much beyond dispute now\nNow speaking of Hillary Clinton did build abused his power because of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky the Internet there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you this is where the
