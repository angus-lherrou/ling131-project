E. is our number Earl is in San Antonio Texas earlier on malarial to show that you so much for calling to represent\nOh thank you for having me appreciate it\nYou got it when I hear you fine\nI'm driving down the road for our ears to the San Antonio and driving rain to get to vote for the early voting them all up and start over ... but I'm a registered to vote that and I think this election is important enough\nI hear you fine okay 'cause I I lost you for a moment there is all the the um the Pittsburgh massacre and the pipe bombs what kind of a wild card has injected into this race if any\n\n[noise] okay\nAll right do you need to get a better finishing okay [noise] All right let's let's move on we're talking about the fourteenth amendment yesterday I interviewed John nice man the former dean of Chapman University school of law and we talked about this here's what President Trump said\nOnly immigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of a threat to this one ship without tension the constitution Wade executive order exactly right\nOr have you thought about that is totally wrong it was always told me that you needed a constitutional member ... and you don't get a number one number one you don't need that number to nothing you can do well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in as it may be and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us as soon as they just had it has to end\nUm have you talked about that with ... yeah\nTo wear in the process in the process it will happen\nWith an executive order that's what you're talking about really as if I didn't think anybody but I knew that but me I thought it was the only one China could address\nProfessor issue in can he do this with an executive order\nWell I Believe we could like what you're up or per principles because they cannot amend the constitution provide an executive order Congress and amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court isn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by issuing a judgment or ruling thing\nBut that's not what the president is talking about here the constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship\nIt says anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizen all he's trying to do with clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction me and it doesn't mean anybody who happens to be subject to our laws because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete than that oh in the lead into the country being part of the body politic\nAnd that's what the debate of the fourteenth amendment make clear that's what the early Supreme Court decisions on that's made clear and the Supreme Court has never held otherwise\nWe now so so that would mean that the children of citizen\nOr the children of lawful permanent residents\nAre automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment the children of temporary visitor whether it's a tourist visa or student visa or or or or certainly the children are people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic citizens according to the constitution\nAnd the president is trying to faithfully apply that cause it was drafted and ratified and an ad that meant that the people that path\nThat forty five seconds left professor I thought there was some sort of Supreme Court case that came out in the early eighties have some sort of footnote which people a point to to argue that anybody who's in the country even illegally has a child on the American soil a is an automatic citizen isn't there some sort of case that people point to that rightly or wrongly they use to make that argument\nThey do they apply liver at all and it's ridiculous that said that states have to provide free education\nTo the children of illegal immigrants under the equal protection clause and excited a footnote that says look they're they're they're off of citizens if they're born yet but that was not a holding of the day it was added issue in that case it was just what we called ... that the Supreme Court just for the back of the had added something\nWe come back I'll tell you about what the author of the fourteenth amendment clause that his name is senator Jacob powered\nAlso there was an Eighteen eighty four Supreme Court case a rule that of Native American born under the jurisdiction of a Native American tribes not unilaterally make himself the United states citizen then was Eighteen eighty four cage Eighteen Ninety eight case to court ruled a child born in this country to legal\nResident Chinese immigrants was included in the birthright citizenship but they have never ruled that a child born to illegal aliens on American soil is an automatic citizenship that is how that fourteenth amendment has been interpreted and what I Believe Donald Trump is doing with this executive order is trying to spark\nA Supreme Court challenge to the executive order that ultimately will go our way up to the Supreme Court a and these justices she hopes and I hope will rule the way the senator Jacob powered who drafted this intended it when did Howard said when he drafted it had it for you when I come back I and Larry older do not leave\nTown called the Larry Elder show now with the eighty nine seven one eight eighty nine seven one Seventy two or three meals are on what's on
