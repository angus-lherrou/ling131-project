the FBI so that the FBI can go out and interview these witnesses Susan Collins made an indirect reference to Michael ...\nBy pipeline south ... in his shoes he is coming for an answering an allegation that includes who said he was involved in gang rape and and do things\nGirl I mean that is so who gather said and I think he reacted with anger and English as a father of two\nYoung girls and ten year old and a Thirteen year old I did believe that he should not have taken the shot at the Clintons and bad in\nHis questioning with certain senator responding to their clients protect early on in Amy Clampitt chart that he stepped over the line\nCalled and said that the accusations made by ... had no basis or were unfounded a and a New York times Charlie Savage is actually crediting a ... he was helping the Kavanaugh nomination because it made the allegations not seem serious\nAlthough you have to remember Christine Blasey Ford was also a member of the same class at the same Washington community\nAnd I think we can't discount how much the conversation changed when he came in with the the sweat neck allegations of drug gang rape stuff that seems to have been much less taken as credible\nThan the original out at ... I think that if you listen as Susan Collins speech yesterday and he listen to the river the rhetoric on on the right and coming out of the White House they seized upon and it's much less a credible looking settled allegations\nTo paint the original ones are by association and this is the thing that\nHey mother is your daughter or ... your your son's on how are you going to be hit with it but at the front door allegations were suddenly they were dragging and getting raking everyone and everyone's like what is that a ... he did a huge favor to the White House by coming out and backing this\nWell he made false accusations about me on another matter totally ball but when I was just a disgrace that\nThey're able to do it I'd love to see our libel laws get up and up there you could take people to act like buddy base to the same thing totally false statements you look at what happened and yes I think they should be held liable I Would say they should be held to the highest standards\nYou can go around and whether they get up stories or making false statements about such an important position you can't do that it destroys somebody's life and there were many many false things that was that about a very fine man and\nWhat would that destroyed his family you have this didn't happen and it all came together at the end and people realized it was false accusation balls\nSaid that it was really something\nVery enthusiastic and actually very nice this date because he suffered ... that was really unfair I watched that very closely and he suffered with false statement made about things that never happened\nI was confused by Lisa Murkowski's statement she voted against Kavanaugh a and said she was voting against them because she's not the right person for the court at this time\nMeaning he'd be better Tuesday he'd be better every\nYear from now better six months from now not the right person for the court quote at this time close quote what does that

[noise]\nTo Larry Elder all true\n\n[noise]\nBut um I I I think he he\nMade an inappropriate comment and and by the way and the knowledge that so and you can't you recognize that he did something fairly extraordinary and in a acknowledging that he said some things that he shouldn't have said\nYou know what we're talking about the highest court in Atlanta and even an acknowledgement there is problematic because forever now it can it can it can raise real question and they're all on you\nKnow in ... and ... and now let me give you an example I I've talked before on the show but not not enough length about the longest serving Supreme Court justice in history who was a big hero to liberals you know who it is right\nTo William oh Douglas from yeah come on Washington and justice Douglas or for thirty six years on the Supreme Court he wrote some of the most important legal decision some of which are kind of nutty but they're very important and justice Douglas had so\nMany ethical problems and just named one of them she actually because he had so many alimony payments he had three ex wives\nAnd he had to write little articles to help meet the expenses because he wasn't generating enough money and he wrote articles for a guy who happen to be a pornographer who had a case before the courts\nAnd he later than pay the money back but he was caught with that\nAnd and they see who also wrote articles that it had appeared in like a magazines that were some justices thought were pornography he didn't and just that\nPlus the fact that he got involved with a Twenty one year old who had been assigned to do a term paper and her college about justice Douglas he was married at the time he got involved with her it could be construed as sexual harassment today's terms it didn't ruin his judgeship\nA and a and by the way there were attempts to impeach him and they were foolish and I oppose those attempts uh they\nWere led by Gerald Ford who later became president of the United states\nAs a point over here is that when people say oh because he said I'm some in temperate things when he was giving testimony he can never be taken seriously as a judge\nClarence Thomas has had a fine career on the court he's made some by the way brilliant and amazing speeches since being confirmed on the court\nAnd uh I don't think he has been ruined by the charges against him or let them ruined him at all David I appreciate your call very much um do we have a time to go to the audio Jeremy for from Cairo okay we are coming up well we're coming up too\n[noise] let's move on

Bush widest into that war why because the Republicans did not fight back\nRepublicans did not remind the electorate we've got\nSixteen at the time intelligence agencies guess what all six seats sixteen said that Saddam Hussein has stockpiles of WMD and they all said at the highest level of certainty that there's no such thing as a hundred percent there's a category something called something like\nThe highest level the probability of the highest level of of certainty all sixteen said that Saddam Hussein has stockpiles to the highest level of certainty\nAnd yet the left said Bush lied people died\nGeorge W.
