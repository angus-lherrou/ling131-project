I Want you to listen up because how has a technical\nQuestion that I bet you're you will have input on so\nHow give us a question\nYeah it's a basically what's happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early days ranchers which I don't know if I Want everybody to see what we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA stick obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. D. P. side which is a file transfer sight of that we can get out for our kids to be able to jump on there and drag that\nTwenty two gig radio uh back on to their own computers so that was the best person that we know that that knows about all things digital or we decided to call the gym commando show so here you're dealt\nAnd so so when the sun is Andrew is that they use like a drop box or something like that right and the ... wanting to gain cats huge it's a really huge huge\nHuge and so unless you could you know you can break it out into individual videos right and then you too might be the best place that's what I was thinking too is that you just put it up there and then it can play and then if somebody wants to download it they can download if they want to\nAnd then you can delete it you want to you or you're protected yeah you're protecting put in on a you know with a um a private you are oh\nOh okay so that if somebody is searching for you know how big adventure which we all do\nI mean right that\nThey do that how big adventures doesn't quite come up well I totally miss you guys\n[laughter] well we wish you do it's a very much for pleasure glad to talk to you today yeah\nBarely ... files put it up on YouTube and when you guys come back out we're going to do years three of Hal in\nJackie on the road because if you're in our beer they have a lot of lessons like that mother board story that they can pass along and they're really really great good godly people and I love them dearly thank you my good friends they right where you are more coming up here on the came commando show [noise]\nYeah I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life parents teachers dentists and always a different technique up and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do it for a full two minutes\nOf course Ninety percent of us don't emotional issues worn out toothbrushes to boot so let me introduce you to quit quipped is electric small light and sleek there's a built in two minute timer that pulses every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with Clinton\nKnew brush heads are automatically delivered just as dense as recommend every three months for just five dollars\nTry quit and see why it's backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals\nQuit starts to just twenty five dollars that's it does it get quip dot com slash came right now and get your first refill pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill packets free at G.

commando America's ... digital got us here with you once again and the phone lines are open\nI'm sure you have at least a few questions about something digital I can lend a hand to and that number is one AAA eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us\nOnce again the numbers one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four and before we get back to all of your phone calls this show some more interesting item that crossed my desk and screen that you just need to know about first a wedge it's one of these ideas that popped up and I'm telling ya\nI should have thought of that this is a product\nThat if I ever wanted to create a product it satisfy the name it's private it secure I think it's too pricey right now but let me tell you a little bit about it [noise] the idea of the whole personal email server it kinda got a bad rap\nWith Hillary Clinton and her emails and that whole fiasco but the whole idea is that your email is safe it's not handled in a cloud you actually have a physical drive\nNow setting up an email server used to mean calling the nerds calling them again when you need to change up some settings and calling them again what had just died because\nIt would happen but there's a new product called helm\nAnd your emails no longer floating in the cloud somewhere in that it's actually physically in your home server like I mentioned it expensive\nFive hundred bucks by the size of a book and it has a hundred and twenty a gigs Georgia trade and go to five terabytes there is no fan passively clued cold rather um it has its security\nKiev physical key because also the email is encrypted so it's not just five hundred bucks and there was a hundred dollar a year subscription fake and\nIf you think about it this way there's other downsides and one of them primarily is that you're not going to have all the latest feature saying gee male and auto complete ten you know ... it's going to fill out all the sensors for you but it's a product that does have an edge it does have a need\nAnd when the price come down and I think it's probably worth about taking a look at\nAnd other new products we are talking about smart home technology yeah\nWas specifically ever you ever thought about how your couch it into your home your wish that your couch you can go up or down to earn recline maybe think of was your smart light sync up with your smart thermostat if you've got too hot or cold\nWell el she got together with an Italian ... furniture manufacturer by the name of it do they and they created are you ready for the ... the oh smart so far yeah I Know as blue to speakers building\nAnd they said comes with five customs scenarios you can read to relax watch TV listen to music or pause not really short positive\nAh what's more impressive is that your preferences are remembered native worse with Google Voice so you could\nFake couch I'm ready to relax now and it would I Would get that relaxation boat or couch I'm ready to watch TV [noise]\nUh and peace in the background there all changes with you the smartphone has really expensive or are you ready for a thousand dollars for a little smart though but I Know what you're thinking for four grand that couch ought to give me a massage and give me a cold\nOne without me asking\nI write a lot of our listeners and a lot of our viewers you have your own small businesses and you're probably familiar with square\nIs the way that she processed transactions and take payments\nWell there's a new one out it's called terminal from square and it's kind of a cool thing you should know about it now works with apple pay Google Pay Sam's on pay and also NFC process those payments over why five print that was the\nUh the square reader attachment also for the smartphones transaction right to point six percent plus and since the divide stuff costs four hundred bucks and we pay if you take payments on the go it's hard to beat square\nIt's got all the angles ... covered at a square [noise] ankles\nCovered [noise] matter Andrew it took me a while you laughed at that one\nI took a while though but I Love the more the explanation of a joke if you're on the actual joke well 'cause nobody\nGot it everybody's like has built a goldfish squares angles and got it All right you're going to love this drone\nYou may not think about going to an apple store to buy a drawn but now the apple store they have a two thousand dollar\nDrone for sale you're ready as bad boys called this guy DO are one right the difference is that the guy IDEO basically five itself\nOf course DJ I ... the other what'd you know you have to do manual controls and you've got to actually like know how to fly the thing the sky idea it was like a robot or taught him was camera either the\nSeries of sensors and it will dodge trees follow you around capture videos and photos now the drone can be also control by your apple watch which is the reason why the apple stores now have\nYou seen the ally preview of what the drunks filming but you can control the flight average follow you take out individual people for the drone to follow in film actually kind of cool so you can have a smart cameras smart drone follow you around all day and take your photos\nAnd now you can really drone ... voucher narcissism\nNot laughing about one [noise]\nOn come on now is really good but it seems like the first products of all these tech smart products that I actually want the drone defined goes for ... no it's actually really cool\nI mean that you can throw drone up I mean it's only going to be in the air for twelve minutes I mean the batter doesn't last up to now product\nAnd so and then it will follow you around take pictures but you know that's expensive uh two thousand dollar job\nBut it's really really cool imagine like you've got to my my kid's birthday party if it just followed my daughter around two pictures of the old time of the well if it was you know really short\nParty said she's she can't walk very far yet she's not even one so it might work for her she was really cool it is very by two thousand I think\nI Would you think the drones going to be a year from now a thousand dollars maybe less I bet you\nOkay finally if you're trying to keep tabs on your caffeine intake\nThere's now these smart coffee cup that's where I live in and you're going to know what it's all about amber

temperature and the bubble keep your coffee tea whatever\nAt a certain temperature for two hours okay\nBut here's the deal now the smart mug has an app yes with a companion up you didn't know that you needed an app to go along with your costs of God\nBut now there's blue jays link allows you to know your daily caffeine intake because the dad is passed to the health app that will alert you if you hit your recommended maximum daily caffeine levels\nBecause you're ready this drinking too much coffee can cause a lot of problems [noise]\nOkay All right that's all I got at all I got remember the last story when I said that's really cool and that the product I really want yes reverse of that for this one you know a lot of people are worried are kept a how does it come to even know how much caffeine in a cup of coffee well\nBecause you have to actually say on the app at this coffee this she says the Starbucks\n... whatever Fifteen dollar brought ... Seventeen object to it [laughter] yes exactly especially if you're an apple versus and right now none none of it\nUps in my house connect to the Internet so how much does this cup cost\nTwo hundred and Ninety nine die or get and then of course there's a subscription can you know there is a monthly fee for my ...\nYou know I haven't I've given up on the smart water bottle I don't know if you've noticed I don't have it around me oh we definitely do to gay I mean I was I had high hopes for that smart\nWater but how many weeks three weeks to the law I don't think it lasted that then you know what if you want to take the over under on anything that should've been at first because you wouldn't ... I mean you have like to have a lot of conversations about it\nWas really cool I mean you know that this thing would blink whenever I Need to drink\nWater and then it would keep track of that yeah they can't keep track of it when I'm sitting in your closet and it doesn't really work okay I mean I Wish it worked but doesn't really work but\nIt was a hundred and Ninety dollars for coffee I don't know I made that up it's probably not tonight it's probably Ninety dollars already here is a hundred and fifty okay close\nIt's Phil outrageous stupid but you know what somebody's gonna buy like somebody

by the way and then we have contests you can come see the show and the list goes on and on\nThe on the head over to get Kim Dotcom once again that's get Kim Dotcom it all three hours of the show it's great for when you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona a low there Tom\nBlow their Kim what's going on well I have a question\nUh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah have a a website that I have one son mind right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I'd been toying with the idea of putting a chat a function I'm not sure what you call it a in the Web site where people could ask questions before they came in and the the question I Would have for you is\nIt is a beneficial or the ... you would do is it easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as\nThe employment of people to support that are the questions and what have you\nAlways are they all really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we ... deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd ah you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone in place so I just recently was approached by a company that said they would do is they would have ah\nThey employ individuals to support the ah the ... function and how that would work as they would give me thirty quite or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask them then those are the third question so I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question nobody she they had the the canned answer that I've already give it to them\nBut so does that include she goes ... of those dirty question yeah\nAnd I got and here's the reason why I'm hesitating fact is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right but and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor\nI'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extended that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my role hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the Web site see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get in a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact uh getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you will engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they are going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your site from scratch they have names like Ben desk chat is free uh there's also live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building it for you\nAh yes although the we do have a a website it's already been built and we have another company building or another website I'll always remember that when the media and the Turks tempting as calling me about that in the chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters the kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also listen to those questions under FAA choose as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening and chats and box and things like that\nOr is that you're able to stay you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad news out here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has

[noise]\nThey normally do we get [noise]\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] I don't\n[noise]\n\nPlease get up in the face of from Congress people\nSo that was a GOP ad that was just put out that is absolutely one hundred percent accurate\nSo what is the left doing here what is the Democrat Party doing here because it's clear that they are doing this deliberately the left and we've been pointing this out for a very long time\nIs there an echo chamber the repeat themselves they walk this they have different tactics that they use and then it looks like they all come out\nAnd they say almost the same thing then you see it also heard it on MSNBC you see it on CNN [noise]\nThis is first of all of a very dangerous and second is also very desperate it is very clear that the Democratic party after first trying to de legitimize Donald Trump before he even came into office failed\nTried to take away his the electoral college when I go left or is it didn't happen\nThen deploy the whole a fake dot CA oh and you wait until the second hour Oakland it's radio show because I I have a huge exclusive interview by a witness to Trump Tower you'll\nHear what I mean in just a few minutes but that didn't work either they understand with the economy booming right now with jobs a record rate with the GDP at a record rate the Democrats what can they possibly do\nWhat is the argument\nOne by one Donald Trump is dismantling the entire progressive vista agenda all of block Obama's failures that he enacted one by one Donald Trump or his dismantling and the Democrats have absolutely no response because America is coming back\nWere winning the economy is coming back jobs are coming back were being respected again internationally domestically patriotism is on the rise and so when this happened and that\nIs what the Democratic Party resorts which is the age old ... strategy of trying to fool as many people as you can ah because you can fool some of the people some of the time and Gen up race warfare and class warfare and resistance for the sake of resistance but again resist what\nIt's just like all of this impeachment talk and there are serious they are going to try if the Democrats take the house they're going to try to impeach Trump but for what what did he do duty colluded with Russia\nNo while Hillary Clinton did while the Democratic National Committee did or at least colluded to smear Donald Trump with this fake Russia propaganda\nImpeach him for a while but that is their strategy here and to me this is why I've been focusing and if you miss my show last week check out the podcast connect dot com slash aren't climb on the deliberate move to the radical left of the mainstream of the Democratic party\nPeople like right here in New York ground zero for this as Christians ... who's long been basically a moderate Republican Democrat in the beginning and now she's openly oriented herself toward the far left\nThe Bernie Sanders crowd hanging out with a window source or\nGoing to radical demonstrations turning against Israel which goes hand in hand with turning against the United states of America and patriotism and the fact that she does this and she believes that this is going to position herself for twenty twenty just goes to show you where the Democratic party is\nFirst of all I Want to take your phone calls the media on this eight seven seven nine seven zero to nine nine nine\nOn this of course I mean on the the Democrat mobs the George Soros funded mobs on the streets of the United states and the way that the highest levels now of the Democratic party are calling for borderline violins\nKick somebody we cannot be civil and you heard push back on them by Maxine Waters what the heck do you think she means by that of course we know exactly what she means\nWhy is the Democratic party deliberately sending out these signals that go beyond protest beyond resistance there cannot be any question that they have crossed the line into inciting violence\nAnd so therefore the the second question of course becomes what happened is if you're caught in a Democrat mob a barn eight seven seven nine seven zero to nine nine not\nFor the\nWhat do you think is the Democrats and game here in inciting violence now against Republicans and against national this going against Trump supporters\nNo I Know it is exactly on precisely when the entire argument is turning against the Democratic party and win so transparently they are mobs\nAnd they are being orchestrated from the top or directed or at the very least encourage\nAll of a sudden entered Gavin McKenna is who I have long had concerns about and then you had\nThis breakout quote unquote of some fist fights on the streets in Oregon\nOver the weekend and then if you look at it we're talking about here like this band of maybe twelve people um and clearly McGinnis and is Proud Boys has ... let's just say the trend toward very dangerous ideology and they don't at all represent\nA the Trump supporters are the Tea Party movement this stuff is actually pretty crazy and then you had like a handful of fist fights on the streets of Oregon and then if you look at how many people were there\nAnd they were more reporters and more people they're just taking photographs\nThan the twelve white man of his little Proud Boys that got into that fist fight\nAnd then apparently similarly other make Guinness people on a with him president in New York City also instigated some violence on the streets of New York and just like in Oregon we're talking here about like ten twelve people and then the whole media now focuses on not\nWhile we have the throngs out on the Democratic party and we saw them in full force against Kavanaugh\nAnd there are being encouraged openly by the Democratic party there is no comparison whatsoever so I noticed that that's very interesting that it is happening\nBut all of this strategy in which the Democratic party has turned to a mob rule has turned to an incitement to violence clearly they are\nAiming toward the ...\nThat is why we cannot let them get away with that and that is why everybody listening right now no matter where you are you haven't got to get out and vote for them in terms of less than a four weeks\nAnd actually we hear on this radio show I'm going to be focusing heavily in the coming weeks with more candidates coming on this radio show and you heard last week we focused on New York with the senatorial candidate here shelf early a and one of the congressional candidates I'm going to continue full speed ahead with that are in the next few weeks on the show\nAs I said just so you know what's coming up and the second hour\nYou ... if you've been following my report in you know that I've been focusing on Rob Goldstone and something called the Trump Tower meeting with the infamous meeting and which\nThe Russians from fusion GPS are highly connected to fusion GPS show up at this meeting at Trump Tower for twenty minutes the meetings about nothing the campaigns totally interested and then that twenty minute meeting has been used time and time again as evidence quote unquote by the media\nClaiming some sort of collusion with Russia as if at first of all the Trump campaign weather's just say they were looking to colluded with Russia which is insane within himself like they would do it inside their headquarters in full view of everybody but colluding to ... minutes to steal an election really in so transparently ridiculous\nBut I've been focusing on Trump Tower for another reason and that is because Trump Tower shows in fact the fingerprints are all over that the Russia collusion conspiracy was set up it seems by Hillary by the DNC\nHow is it possible that these people who show up at Trump Tower the day before the day of adding the day after having dinner with fusion GPS\nWhich of course put out the fake news ... how is it possible that the Russian lobbyist takes in trained that morning would they Hillary associate means with them before the dinner at the meeting meets with them after Trump Tower and nobody notices and then he's the guy who passes the dusty aided joined McCain\nPrison for bombings he's coming to speak at Hofstra University so what are the students or kids or the young young Americans and whoever go to these colleges they're indoctrinated by people who are terrorists and then decided\nOh by the way don't build airs well hello bill airs was a terrorist ... was the guy who boasted about bombing the Pentagon a bombing uh trying to bomb the police headquarters\nAnd then he goes underground and comes out because he's part he by the way the FBI screwed it up it was never found innocent he was guilty he comes out and what does he do he gets into education\nDoes anybody think that it's a coincidence that the weather underground was plotting the murder of Seventy five million Americans according to you\nOr the FBI informant that he then comes out and then to continue his radical revolution what does he do\nHe found was a it was called the small schools workshop with another radical and then get government funding by the way so it ... education is key here but then we kind of again sort of just like when these\nDemocrats would go and if I go on these solidarity visits with radical countries we kind of set in okay it's weird but what can we say oh we also kind of didn't pay attention to this dangerous mentality\nInside the universities so now it has gone from the universities and no mistake about it with people like Bill heirs\nTo the streets of America and to the top leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd their disciples people that were indoctrinated by these communist are now advisors and age two congressmen and senators they're teaching other people there riding the textbooks for the teacher schools\nThere in our mosques in our churches there and synagogues these people are sprinkled out they're spread out there and send you waited and infiltrated throughout society so this they're pushing for the peaceful transition to world socialism and now they're getting a little bit more radical\nI Believe they were aiming for the hundredth anniversary of the Soviet revolution I mean these people are claiming Trump colluded with Russia\nCelebrated the hundredth anniversary of the Soviet revolution and they recently celebrated the two hundred part they have called marks\nSo yeah and by the way they are loaded with the Institute for policy studies Obama's or a Obama's White House ... is this ... different
