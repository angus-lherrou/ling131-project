a little bit about immune health\nAnd this is really a a big deal and um most people are not aware of some of the armamentarium that's available these days uh one of the big players on the block that has not been available before\nIs something called nuclear tides and these are the actual building blocks of the cell and it takes a staggering six billion be\nTo build one cell so once we had a blow and injury uh dramas surgery or even a cold or flu or anything that would damage the tissue we're calling upon our supply of nuclear tides swell\nOr if you've got them great if you don't you do have to wait\nFor the body to make enough and when this comes to a building new tissue it can really be a problem\nThat say you had his surgery and the body is going to pack whatever it's got on hand into that cut or wound or injury but if you've got those nuclear ties will uh this can mean helping the body deliver or promote the best possible\nRecovery and function for your body [noise] you know nuclear gods had been around quite a while in Europe is sold under the name on set because they view them is so important to promote best health if you're struggling with any kind of immune issue\nAnd of course in addition to nuclear times ... is another key player that can act like a stand in immune system especially in your intestines because it as human active pre formed immuno glob

you can reduce the white cells demand\nDuring all of this by jumping on a little bit of claws from really great thing to do but you know one of the big missing links we don't usually have normal levels of vitamin D three\nAnd in the last five six years\nDeeds three has been shown to be a critical player in the formation of literally all two hundred plus immune compounds that the body mix wow so this is really key player so we produce a product called the three gold and\nUh it's really good they use about probably about six drops of this and if you're under forty you can just take the drops straight preferably at your main meals so there's plenty of protein\nAnd that's the escort for the fat of the deed three\nAnd a if you're forty or over then you really should consider putting the deep three in a maybe a half ounces of water and adding a three four drops of an organic lemonade that's essential oil of orange stirred up good you'll see that the lemon ... pie\nAnd quickly the

teeth\nFit don't then surely an on off down the\n... why is that a I'm not\nIn a way I see them I think it's a sauce is soft can get\nThese really decay yes\nOkay well but that's not a reason to remove him because that gives you a lot of biting surface in my opinion is you always want to keep every tooth you got in your mouth or what I Would do of course\nIs to make sure that she brushes and losses and you monitor that choose to make sure and if it does decay you can use the low fusing ceramic materials were stronger than your original to\nOnce it's laser bonded in there and then you keep all it binding surface you see the upper teeth of your mouth\nAre used by the body to respirator the base of the brain so you don't want to lose a to Z unless it's in sideways are infected or something's really bad about it okay then get it the heck out of there but otherwise you know you want to keep everything the greatest one gave\nYou [laughter] okay and I\nGuess the night got some time so he can fix it doesn't have to we can get ending had it\nCame out most of the time when you're grinding teach here in voting laws\nSo you need to check her first morning you're in ph and you wanna should be in the Green Zone six four to seven oh now she consumes a lot of dairy products or for meat fish poultry eggs it may be very difficult to have this ph where it belongs\nAnd when it's not there then it's very common that wheel grind or teeth so I Would keep the by guard until you can see a first morning you're in the age that holds for a good two three four weeks\nStraight then you know that uh she probably won't need the backyard OK\nOkay and I have a question I have clean clean hand fed and I've actually had a stomach the taught for ... for type stomach half\nAre actually lower lower ...\nOh well that's different usually it occurs in the upper area and that would be normal and you wouldn't mean bone loss but when you're losing when they want bone on the patient in the lower jaw now you're into what's called the L. veal or bone\nAnd that bone is very sensitive to boneless so if you need to build that area I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole until you first figure out why you're losing bone so the normally you would get a roller ph paper and check the first morning you're in the age\nNow [noise] this is like a dog chasing his tail though because if there is remaining infection in them out no matter what we do you're not going to get that the age to the Green Zone six four to seven oh\nHow're it'll maybe come in and go out\nUm so first you need to be sure there's no raging infection left in the mouth like a dead twos or a pocket of infection from an old extraction something like this\nSo we need to hunt that down and make sure we got rid of that then we've got to work on getting the first morning here in ... now if you were five years old this would be usually a very easy task done\nBut when I have five so neither you rise so the task could be\nEasy could be hard so first we get the V. H. paper and we find out where we are no if you're already in the blue zones you're in deep trouble that means you're making a Monet above your urine and you're really low and minerals\nThen when you start with the something like the coral and vitamin D D three gold and you start maybe with a half a tease one of the coral\nAnd every three days you check yourself but if it if it was blue ... dropped down to the five or ... is very yellow and then then it should build his way back up\nAnd so every three days your jacket as long as it's going up you don't have to increase the girl\nThat doesn't want to go up you could double the coral and see if it'll start moving\nLet's say well OK then we may have to support\nParasite road and the kidney okay so many times we can support the kitten he was simply taking five ... your body size\nLike our deejay two hundred and for the parents I read you can use the ... is one of the things that works well\nMay be true capsules just once a day\nWith the lunch and now see will that move the ph now does the ph come up okay now if it comes up on stage and they're great but said comes up but it won't stay in there or you can't quite get it in them\nOkay there's still some ... some infection somewhere in the body\nAnd now you're going to need to visit with a cure a person and all this should be done before you do any kind of bone graft thing okay 'cause if you try any of that is it's not gonna work good and you're not going to heal well when they do the other dental work so it's a whole darn thing is going to be bad\nSo you get a ... a practitioner and they can test the teeth and the gums and especially the area behind the teeth called the retro mole area because so many of us have infection that sits there most of our live\nFrom the extraction of a impacted wisdom tooth and the ... a residual infection being dealt with [noise]\nSo what we can do they're usually can\nLocate through the cure it practitioners out one of the dentist and has a laser like in in the ... laser and they can crank up the power to maybe three watch herself and disinfect that whole era and you'll be able to see the ph becomes mobile then\nAnd um it might take one or two times to do it but let me tell you your future is riding on is if you don't get your bones metabolism going good and you're sixty nine by the time you're eighty nine you won't even be able to walk\nOkay I hear you it's not a pleasant prospect that's offered for us as we age and part of it is our crummy mental status food\nPart of it is our overeating oil and part of it is of course desperately needing to be able to digest our food well that's the other thing you gotta do you got to make sure you're on some kind of pancreatic enzymes like quantum digest\nYour body weight at least two of those at the start of a meal the end of the meal may be five or even six between ... and now you know you're just saying that we did in your twenties and if you have plaque\nThis will get the plaque right off the teeth to so it's your warning and at your age or shouldn't eat cooked food without taking digestive enzymes if you do you're asking for
