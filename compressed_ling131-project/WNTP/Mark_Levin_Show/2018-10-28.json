puts down road in Fleetwood now you can check out that same awesome service\nBecause he's got the facts jak as they say Mr Bruce how're you doing buddy new bill hey we've\nGot lots to talk about but before we get into I'm winning a recent columns about the courts usurpations of the Democratic process speaking of which let's talk about the um the Democratic process of agitation here\nA British in history I mean we had anything like this or is this you know you know just something that we can look back and say well it's certain points in time um this is what we've run into in our country\nWe have had it for for a bill in the run up before the civil war and the country was as divided as it had never been before in my opinion never been ... and the Congress\nI mean the number of fight but Congress really got into the number of the number of 'em but they got into the issue over the issue of slavery\nA divided Congress probably for I guess about ten years in the run up the civil war\nAfter the compromise of Eighteen fifty which kind of\nThe way the civil war but we're not going to prevent it because the Congress was absolutely at each other every member of Congress has at each other's throats over that issue so I Would say it's been worse\nWell on right now I'm ... and you wonder you say okay well what is the catalyst of all this uh you know many want to blame certainly on the left you know they want to blame Donald Trump and his verbiage\nBut what say there's acts of violence on the left that are just are mounting that of course the the media is and not not about to publish um and I got a report this morning here\nThis went through a litany of attacks on Republicans and um you know they're out there trying to campaign or Republicans getting attacked I mean beat up any ... you know a\nA ... you know they're ending up in hospitals there you know sitting there Lincoln oil as they're trying to campaign 'cause they've just been beat up and you know ... um you know you got Maxine Waters thing ... you know chase them getting their face a\nSpartacus himself [laughter] you know talks about or you know getting in a elected officials face to face and you got to Eric Holder saying hey when they go low we kick them and you know which was a spin off of what Michelle Obama's then about when they go low we go high or I guess now we just kick 'em\n... is the short version to end the updated version of a you know of that whole deal so this is this is really gotten out of hand and you you think oh gosh you know what we're gonna end up with something and then of course there was a reference I'm\nAbout to you know the ... the the couple of what the ah ... music artist thing um you know when was the last time a president was killed by an actor you know\nYeah [laughter]\nYeah but I think that this is going to her I think this is going to have their public from the mid term election Republicans in mid term election though I think that the the fair minded people in this country are looking at this craziness\nAnd going for people I Want representing me in in the national government might be wrong about that but I Do notice that in that ... that I'm\nPolls are now showing that in a contested states now at least from the outside whereas there was like Thirteen fourteen percent advantage on the Democratic side a month ago is now one two three no I think that this whole um these attacks\nAre hurting the Democrats image and I think that hopefully this will reflect the self in the mid term election\nOr the Democrats so unhinged Bruce that they can't see the damage that this does to their own party I mean 'cause the thing is this let's just say let's let's say Democrats to take over\nAnd and even if they don't regardless I mean we've got people here they got some serious mental problems I mean they got there exercising themselves\nAnd this is all you know the mainstream media is not reporting on it it's almost like it's acceptable so even after the election we've got their mentality and they're anxious to deal with I mean this isn't like suddenly going to go away I'm In you know after the election\nNo it's not no it's not it started when Trump was elected certainly not going away after they it's not going away anytime soon now but but I but I Wonder though I mean I Am\nI I think okay so the Kavanaugh hearings or another example okay for the media you know they they couldn't they couldn't hide that they were broadcasting may be the earrings so they couldn't play down\nHow the Democrats embarrass themselves and embarrassed the country and the way they treated Kevin\nMhm right well\nI mean truly cook who you know the the cook political parties are kind of D.C grew and this is a quote those who ended up out of control demonstration on Capitol Hill against the cabinet nominations have any understanding of how much damage they did the Democrats and the party's chances of winning majority in the Senate\n... won't do it but you know but they have no way I Do think the capital here have just like the craziest you were talking with Maxine Waters Cory Booker\nKamala Harris all those I think that this is going to be a problem for them and in terms of how it would be fair minded average American is going to look at look at at the at the ... midterm elections\nAnd again I maintain a bruise the sad thing about all this is that\nWe need Democrats in the fray here to be on deck\nTo help us you know come up with solutions\nTo solve the problems I mean they are so unhinged right now they've lost their mind because they hate Donald Trump so much just like oh you guys go figure this out go call time out go out in the woods maybe you'll find Hillary out there I don't know\nBut maybe you might find the other part of your mind that you lost so that you can come back and be a positive part of getting this country back on track\nBecause it should be so unhinged in to lose your mind in the ... ... you know to this degree\nIt's like I'm I'm thinking man what do we how much longer is this going to last year we've got a lot of positive things happening in our country did you imagine\nAnd and not to just you know I I don't know if we've ever had a ... you know a ... and ongoing kumbaya moment with Democrats in and bipartisanship that we could look back and say hey this is what this looks like\nA ... you know we can certainly talk about nine eleven but that was so short lived a you know 'cause then it was like okay go to your respective corners there and you can even talk after a Steve's beliefs and the Republicans got right um uh got attacked on the softball field but\nYou know it just can't seem to\nSustain itself and um you just I don't know Bruce I just hope and pray that uh you know some a silver mines will um will take over here\nAnd stop the insanity because of the trajectory years very dangerous I mean it's one thing that you know physically attack somebody but a union you know if somebody is set a couple I think Rand Paul says something's going to I mean and he got hurt but I mean somebody could get killed here\nYeah yeah and and the problem is that you mention is that if we don't have we need Democrats you're right we need Democrats\nTo me that's halfway All right that you don't get any laws passed in Congress unless there's bipartisan support\nFor the law Congress' job is to pass laws creating public policy in order to do that you have to compromise both parties have to compromise both parties have to meet each other half way you're not going to get everything you want to legislation but if you get enough where you want to support the legislation then that legislation will pass\nAnd if you if if the Democrats are going to go as crazy as you were saying they are continue to be that way then we won't get any legislation passed we won't get any public policy created it'll just be the kind of stalemate we've been seeing for the last several years only works\nWhen we need the part of the country they represent to be represented in the legislation and and we need their ideas this is all part of compromise as you say Bruce and this is ... you know we're missing out and everybody's paying a price for this we've got more than ... stay with us [noise]\nThe United nations empire is the most of their claims the United states is the

I think there are several reasons for that clearly a rising interest rates are the Federal Reserve is clearly going to raise rates again\nIn December they've already done it three times of the year ... and it looks like they want to raise them at least three maybe even four times next year it no matter what the market was telling the stock market has gotten weaker amount of housing has been hurt by it\nBut the fed says they want to get their rights back to what they call normal levels no matter what the impact us on the market and I think that's definitely one of the things taking your impact here well they didn't have that kind of sense when a block Obama was president correct I didn't feel at the time of the economy is strong enough to withstand rising interest rates now they're feeling strong enough\nTo do that and they raise the eight times since I started this process in December of two thousand Fifteen ... and there's a lot more to come and so people are saying and including President Trump is saying you're raising rates too much too fast\nWhen I was going to cause economic problems and slow down the economy and it's I mean in the housing market we've definitely had a slowdown in home sales some of the markets that really got overheated like Seattle\nSan Francisco definitely cooled off the thirty year fixed rate mortgages over five percent my bill so that means that I'm On the margins some people saying I I don't\nYou know so what can we do what can we do it I mean because the fed is uh the feds the fat is on his own uh does whatever it wants and all that is right or what recourse do we have it's not like we can uh you know put a sanction on the fed can no\nIn fact it's the opposite when President Trump criticize them and they want to feel independent they're going to go the other way they're going to be even more aggressive to show that are not caving in to him to some extent I mean as investors what you've got to do is to put your money where it doesn't have volatility\nBut you're getting a decent meal you know the feathers raising rates and the banks are raising what they're paying what what they're charging\nMountains but they're not raising what they're paying on deposits for the most part\nI mean I mentioned before you know what what are your people are a good alternative are these secured real estate fun mhm 'cause that's the way of getting an eight percent field but the price of it doesn't go up or down not violence all stays or\nTen dollars a share matter what the markets are doing basically and you get an eight percent current ills wasn't with monthly checks if you are gr reinvest uh there's a website for that secured real estate ... dot com and ... and so there's an alternative ah instead of giving them in the bank pretty much earning zero\n... I I don't mean to get political that seems like everything's political these days um you know what the fed is doing as I said you know compared to what they did with the President Obama\nAnd um you know for them now I mean it's like they're not even taking any kind of consideration I Know that that Trump was you know going hey out I mean you're you're working against us here without going to get this economy going I'm let's remember whose team were on and let's or\nThey don't look I got to look like they're on his team that's not the way they've\nBeen I guess that's my point that kind of makes this political because instead of saying okay what works for the greater good I mean I'm a you'll get your money I mean there's attack the matter is you still got to figure out how to um you know reconcile with four or five trillion dollars are printed money you did under the Obama\nAnd they've been trying to reduce that their balance sheet went up to about four and a half trillion that's correct right and as these are the treasury notes come do\nInstead of the ruling them over there a maturing them and so that's shrinking their balance sheets slowly I mean we're not pray fast but it's going man slowly right but yeah they see that as their priority and they see the priority is getting the interest rates up to levels so that when the recession have got a place to go down basically but they're creating\nThe economic slowdown that's going to cause problems in the future and I think it could be mentioned as not to I'm not saying recession but certainly slower economic growth not going to four percent economic growth who just rates going up as much and so President Trump is right it's just normally you don't say that was kind of things to the Federal Reserve ever you know as explicitly as has been doing\nWell that's okay that's why we love [laughter] he's exposing all this to help us understand the cause and effect relationship that uh and and exposes people in terms of

instead of having four rotors that are normally found on a quad copier you get that is what has Eighteen rotors\nAnd the self driving drones taxi\nAs capable of carrying two people for distances about Eighteen mile let me tell you something I wouldn't go more than ten miles just to be on the safe side and I know what you're asking you're thinking about this and they fly over prison walls and what we can they carry\nI'm just asking for a friend of course can I ask you a question Ken yes I watch the video while you were telling that story yes what do you think is going to be safer\nA a ton of

then it goes Eighteen mile we'll know as well as I Do that sometimes your iPhone works long [laughter] I heard that and other times twenty five percent sometimes means in our twenty five percent to I guess that's why I said I wouldn't do more than ten miles no risk it just it's OK\nAnd just not and only two people so this way you can freak out together no I'm I'm not did you ever you know you would never get it and I saw the videos like may be no no I'm I've decided no ... speaking of Walmart it's almost time to get your shopping started for Christmas\nAnd let me tell you the retailers are

going to really apply himself next year that would be good as the director pod casting what are you got for us\n[noise] well I wanted to kind of highlight as you said we've got our commando odd Cass Tech news this week tech news today but really what it wanted to highlight was\nUm our other podcast so we have our history and the highway pie gas which I mentioned before and this was an awesome podcast\nUm hosted by Stan Ellsworth have he does a great time he does an awesome job the way he tells the stories um is just amazing he brings it to life he's just you know a big biker guy and he just tells you stories and uh and really um like I said just really brings us the life and just really animated\nIt's right now as I listen to his podcast about the railroads yet I have to tell you I ... you know what I was sitting there on\nHer I guess you know it's part of my company I should listen to it to you know like it was one of those like reluctant lessons and I was still I think I was fascinated by it I mean all the fun facts that he shares but his demeanor and the way that he tells the story\nYeah it really is all about the storytelling with a with his podcast and listen to it it's awesome history and the highway and then we got our cyber law podcast several I now I'm it's hosted by a attorney Steven Templar\nSteven is a big time eternity I mean he's on he's the chair of the Internet of things for the American bar association I mean he's worked in Washington New York now he's in ...\nBut yes yeah and his uh his ... his podcast about artificial intelligence\nWhat it is how would how it works with machine learning how it works with with algorithms and how they're trying to get to know you as much as possible uh on line and your habits um it's just it's a fascinating I guess the people he interviews are are off at all\nAnd you know the Stevens whole belief I don't know if you've ever had the chance to actually speak with him about this topic but his whole believe is that we are putting all these gadgets around us without thinking about the ramifications that we have this Internet of things we have artificial intelligence we have Facebook whatever May Day\nAnd we buy all this stuff but we don't consider how it's really going to affect us he was actually the lead counsel I mean if you remember on hello Barbie\nWhen the there's Barbie doll would go ahead and

ahead and lock everything down\nYeah and in exactly that his broadcasters kind of opens the doors and and just kind of opens their minds to that um you know thinking about those types of things um and then our other a podcast we have as you've mentioned before the golden age of radio um\nWhich I Am a super big fan of vintage radio shows I listen to them on the way in and out of the golden Rachel age of radio it's radio shows from the thirties the forties and fifties my personal favorite is yours truly Johnny Dollar listen to it I thought on it really is really good um how\nDo how do you do

Kim\nWho for some strange reason you notice that Soros and the who's who of the radical left the same individuals who are behind Brock Obama have been foursquare behind Andrew Gillum here where I Am broadcasting from Florida\nAnd then also if you notice the media all this sort of is zeroing in on this specific race\nOn a Sunday night last Sunday night there was a debate on CNN aired live a between Andrew Gillum and run to Santa [noise] and it's not normal for CNN to be airing a live debate of a local election\nSo the question becomes why are they specifically focusing on a Florida and why am I focusing on Florida\nAnd why in the last few days have so many members of the news media deployed here to Alabama to to sorry to Orlando\nUh before we were all deployed employment to Alabama so what's going on here in Florida that has captured the attention of the ... a national media\nAnd why is the Soros crowd focusing so heavily yes they're focusing on a lot of racist but they are putting so much right now into the governor's race in Florida will answer those questions in a bit but I Want to hand out and take a step back\nA especially now for everybody listening across the country why are the mid term elections right now ... definitely the most important mid term elections that I can remember in my lifetime what is at stake\nThe answer of course is everything\nNow I very rarely read on this radio show I don't like to read from articles because it's kind of not good radio I like to just do everything live right into the microphone I don't read anything\nBut I Want to read a few paragraphs actually of a Reuters article of all news agencies because actually in this\nIn the scope of this article I think it spells out exactly what is at stake and I think it's critical to again everybody pay attention and because if you're not planning to vote you better get out immediately and change that plan\nReuters quote if Democrats win control of the U.S house of representatives were the Senate next month so again whether they win control of the house for the Senate quote nearly every aspect of Donald Trump's presidency would face swift examination\nFrom his long elusive [laughter]\nA long and do some tax returns to possible business ties with Russia and conflicts of interest congressional sources say\nThey'll is of course stop right there first of all of course there's zero evidence whatsoever of any Russian collusion it doesn't exist at all they're ... they're all of the evidence has one hundred percent foursquare been the exact opposite\nWhich is from start to finish Hillary the DNC set up Trump Tower Hillary and the DNC fabricated ... against Donald Trump had been using it not just to smear\nFirst a presidential candidate with allies\nAnd then a sitting president would live\nBut actually there's so much evidence that it was Hillary's people that was Obama's top of people who may have committed massive crimes using a fabricated trumped up document and yet here we have congressional sources telling Reuters that they if they get in and believe me they are being serious\nIf Democrats win control of either the house or the Senate among many other things is that they're going to start so many new investigations\nInto Trump and so many things including Russia which is patently absurd but this is what they're going to try to do next\nWell numerous protests have been expected of Democrats winning age already in the November six elections these sequencing again I'm reading Reuters and scope of their inquiries has only begun to emerge in recent talks among party leaders and prospective chairs\nNow goes on to say Democrat majorities in the house where the Senate would bring more money and staff for investigations that could derail or delay Trump's agenda\nSo if they get control even of just Congress what they're trying to do is totally bring out fake uh investigations that would delay obstruct\nUp you skate cause problems for a president who right now is trying to get immigration reform through should we have the Senate and the house is trying to get health care altered has been doing everything that he can to reform the American economy\nHas been using every waking hour to try really to make America as you said great again on so many levels\nAnd then of course we have the Supreme Court which could have one or even two openings within the next you know who knows but certainly probably within a Trump presidency and maybe within the next year or two\nNo we got an does for the low level that the Democrats would stoop\nTo first of all during the election where we saw that they would stoop to using totally fabricated things in order to smear\nWith X rated fabricated things the presidential candidate ... certain hotel room in Moscow\nOf things that never happened which by the way uh we did an exclusive interview two weeks ago on this radio program with the individual who actually booked that hotel room for Donald Trump that night and it's clear that I see a lot\n[noise] so we should have known even during brought about his presidency by the way where he would get up and totally lie totally mislead the American public on so many levels\nBut then we had during the two thousand sixteen campaign or the Democrats put their really evil ways conniving evil lying ways on steroids\nAnd then after the campaign they tried everything they could to stop this president\nBut I think the American public got a real taste of all of this with the efforts to totally destroy Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nYou saw the fangs come out you saw the tactics you saw the desperation you saw the way that they would use accusations that were laughable actually when you look at some of them and then take them seriously\nYou saw the way that Dianne Feinstein or somebody certainly in the media treated a woman who wanted to be quiet and not come public although actually there are some questions about that but\nAbout sexual assault delegations and the way they didn't care and they hijacked the issue of me to\nHijack the issue of women's rights hijacked be very very serious issue and I agree fully square that women need to have a right to be heard and it is very dangerous not you but it is also very dangerous to hijack that issue for not just political reasons but in order to totally destroy\nDismantle eliminate the U.S Supreme Court justice which didn't work and that\nKind of ideology that kinds of evil really is going to be on full display but times infinity if the Democrats take control of either the house which looks possible or the Senate\nEverything is at stake literally everything that that everybody\nListening to this radio program worked for and fought for and believes in and actually has been partially in acted and hopefully maybe a little bit more an actor and should Donald Trump or should be Democrats lose in Congress and the Senate it's all at stake and more\n... [noise]\nWhich is why we're ever you are right now even if you're listening in a state where you think that your vote doesn't matter so you're not going to get out and vote\nThis is very different and you really never know so literally no matter where you are a you must you must vote during the mid\nTerm elections now okay as long as I said before I'm right now broadcasting from Orlando, Florida A M here covering the campaigns are both for Senate ah locally and then also the governor's race especially\nNow here's one of the many reasons that I'm here covering the governor's race and I think people now are ... starting to realize that this is what's going on\nAndrew Gillum you love this radical who um is claiming to be a moderate even though he has been associated as I thoroughly reported\nWith radicals who preached against Israel who preached against America against patriotism or against police\nBy the way does any of this ideology sound familiar\nTo those of you who read a certain book that I wrote in New York Times best selling book in a two thousand and eight ... president kind of sounds like something of a about what's going on here in Florida with Andrew Gillum but actually there's more to it\nHere's what I realized many months ago and then many others I don't think did and so right now and I think that they're kind of panicking over Florida I realized many months ago and then many others I don't think did and so right now and I think that they're kind of panicking over Florida\nMuslim countries right and then you remember all of a sudden ... are all these organizations are suing the administration to stop it and then you take a closer look and actually they are all finance not only by Soros but actually a lot of them graduated this academy you look at\n'em virtually any issue look at the Kavanaugh hearings from just a few weeks ago look at who was protesting it was the who's who of disorders funded radical left you look at\nAgain take any issue that you can possibly have environmental reform quote unquote and then you look at all these groups and what it looks like to do outside observer is wow there are a lot of people who are protesting Kavanaugh\nWow there are these human rights organizations that are want to stop because they say it's very bad Donald Trump from extreme vetting\n... all these organizations that want to uh do this do that\nIn ways that kind of I think are dangerous for the United states of America but then you take a step back and they are all interconnected it's many arms of the same octopus some people virtually when you use zoom out which almost nobody does and you see the full picture here\nAnd you see the full scale\nOf this radical Soros financed army\nYou realize that it's more centralized than almost anybody really fully understand and until you take a step back and look at that ... you can't really know fully\nFirst of all by the way how brilliant it is because almost nobody can see this and second what we're really up against and then not know zeroes us back in ... Andrew Gillum here in Florida\nHe went to this radical training academy ... on this who's who of these soils finance radical left\nWhat's going on here maybe there's a larger picture here\nMaybe he's not just some random guy I mean you can say okay you know he's been tied to these groups he went to a training academy for radicals why is this not headline news how is it that I put this out at Breitbart and yes\nUm Fox News talked about it and I know that uh the candidate here in Florida a dissenters I Believe talked about it um\nBut where's the New York times where CNN this guy went to a
