I think about that\nRace relations are getting worse\nPeople agree that they're getting worse but they don't discuss it with friends or family\nHousing something on the part of the people like pop of it's just that people are discussing it because it's such a sensitive topic because America still feeding racism the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow yeah to block cetera\n[noise] let me tell you why people don't talk about it first of all most people don't think they are racist\nThey don't most people think they're fair most people think that there give people an even shot most people consider themselves to be Christians and the whole basis of Christianity is the golden rule cream people that way you want to be treated most people think they do that\nSo they don't like the races number two if the greater diversity of right and I am that racism is not a major problem in America anymore despite the fact that you feel things are getting worse doesn't mean there's some major problem is it ruining your day is to stop and you can going into a marketing ordering something\nIf the person behind the counter happens to be a different race in yours of course not\nWe're getting along just fine here\nIn this country the third reason people don't say anything if\nYou tell the truth about how you feel and you're going to be called a racist or an Uncle Tom witness what's going on with Kanye West witness they're retreating and Steve Harvey had to give you a quick story buddy of mine just told me the other day he's in a bar\nMy buddy is white everybody in the bar is white and it's a sports bar is normally there are sports things on TV for some reason with local news\nAnd they were doing a story about how a bunch of ... every year uh for for several days or Lynn their services for free to poor people are and they interviewed some woman happened to be black holding her baby and she was saying I my baby\nNeeds braces my baby needs braces and some white guys said\nWhat about your baby 's husband what about your baby's father what about your husband what about your boyfriend where's eat\nAnd then some guy a table to over said hey that's rice and the guy to an argument and the guy that said hey this raises eventually left because uh you started to escalate to the point where who knows what might have happened so here you have all white guys one white guy saying out loud hey\nWhere's your where's the baby where's the father of your baby how can we can help us what he said how come the father of your baby can't help you\nStories that perfectly agenda question he's called racist by another white guy\nSo the point is people don't talk once the upside I'm going to say how I feel it's going to be politically incorrect next thing you know I'm a big around an Uncle Tom\nIdeas aggressive racism and not a major problem in America and I'm Talking to somebody who thinks it is what's the upside how am I going to prove it what what am I supposed to say\nThat's why so coach you're not helping anything and Matthew is Chris Matthews exposed again listen to this mainly for\nWhite people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist so of his show you're not in some\nCartoonish way you get them off the hook you know what I'm saying\nNow Matthew is making two points although he doesn't realize that the first is\nMost people aren't racist sorry not\nSecondly since most white people won't vote for somebody if they think they're racist it's necessary for us to characterize that person as racist to brand Reagan his races to brand George W Bush's races to brand Donald Trump is racist because most white people will vote for him to get it and he raises therefore we're going to characterize it as racist\nThat's the con he says it's the only thing it\nMost white people coach are not racist are your friends racist are you a racist how your friends' friends' races\nKnock it off\nNineteen Ninety seven time CNN poll poll black teenagers in white teenagers have talked about this before both were asked\nDo you think racism is a major problem in America more white steam thought it was in black teams\nBut then they asked this do you think racism is a big problem a major problem or a big problem a ... a ... ... minor problem or no problem in your own daily ally\nEighty nine percent of the black teens that racism was a miner or no problem in my daily life grow up knock it off you gotta do three things get to the middle class coach you know this\nFinish high school don't have a kid before you're twenty get married before yeah that kid you will not be poor regarding this business about a institutional racism and and structural racism and\nAnd uh uh what's the other word institutional structure Roland\nA systemic racism yeah how about the police coach tell these young black men comply you won't die\nVirtually all of these high profile cases would not have taken place had the individual flash suspect simply complied\nAnd the Supreme Court has ruled even if the officer gives you an illegal order you must comply unless that illegal order if the company would force so you're not helping any anybody coach and the big problem coach is when you're a leak\nLook in the mirror for every player that does not have a kid outside of wedlock there's a player with to\nDo something about that that is the number one probably in the black community number one problem in the country forty percent of kids in this country are born outside of wedlock that is a massive problem Seventy three percent of black kids coach outside of wedlock that's the problem\nNot racism knock it off\nWell let me talking with Dr ... and just a second one of the things we were talking about is the abduction and apparently the murder of this Washington Post reporter here's what Jake Tapper set about it\nThe afternoon the president is denying he's giving cover in any way to the ... the thing he simply wants to find out what happened but that's about as top as the president was willing to get he has had\nHarsh words in the last week or so for Stormy Daniels Senator Elizabeth Warren and Taylor\nIf they knew that the Saudis responsible for the likely butchering quarter of a Washington Post columnist ... you see there are there going I mean well a CNN's defense guy mud to this\nOne quick bone that's only half the bombshell here I mean they really interesting part of this is an addition addict typically prosecutorial side of this as you reported the opening we're talking about a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will from all are going over Rosenstein let me play this out Washington Rosenstein get the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened\nDuring the investigation that Congress I bet it's going to turn around and say we want to see that in the Congress is going to lead there's going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictments I really want to see what's in that narrative of work at it\nAs well so we're gonna talk to Dr ... about CNN reporting that we may see more indictments from Robert Mueller and has the parents as president been dismissive about what's happened to the Washington Post journalist [noise] Hi I'm Larry Elder do not leave town\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused I'm I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time now a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like that long ago it wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and Neal before the cross ... what is it been five\nThis remember this was a the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform remember that\nThere's a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago or it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean when you're the executive ... weren't the executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your county in traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker said two years since this happened\nI haven't heard from many of them I understand the party line is that it was a personal matter and I can respect that however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I've not heard from any of that\nPaul I don't know why he would want to talk about it but the fact is I I figure it's a social but they do get involved but when I was hoping that started type ... have made that offer to the Saudis in a ... uh why do I figure it's a search will simply this I mean\nWhat were what the Saudis are promising is a full accountability and a very thorough in rapid investigation but the problem is we've got a real elephant in the room they're dealing with their credibility for almost two weeks the Saudi leadership has maintained\nThat their size or you exited the cause of the day he arrived on the consulate by a back door and provided no evidence to\nSupport that whatsoever and they all obviously he was saying there was no foul play well now we know there is foul play that I not brings a lot of credibility to what they've been talking about for two weeks that begs the question\nWhat kind of an investigation or we're going to get will it be accurate and we'll be credible and that's why I'm suggesting if you had the FBI or live side by side with them I think tell me about it it was certainly increase the accuracy of the credibility of investigate\n[noise] you know\nThere's an article in the council for Foreign Relations and that's considered to be kind of a moderate a group not neo cons but not does either and I talk about this difficult relationship that we've had for decades with Saudi Arabia\nIt's not that the U.S shouldn't walk away from Saudi Arabia because it is a major oil producer\nAnd partner in the fight against terrorism or because the bilateral relationship has benefited Washington the larger issue is that Saudi Arabia if Saudi Arabia is left to its own devices you will so more chaos in the middle East that something no one needs in the ... [noise]\nI mean the same people criticizing the president\nWere the same ones who are cheering bronco Obama when he did the bird dog the member that exchange the detainees from get mold for this disorder\nNever mind that what was it about twenty twenty five percent of the detainees released from getting local back into the battlefield you guys are okay with that you guys are okay with the Iran deal and as soon as the ink\nSoon as it's been time before the ink was dry the I told us going back or chanting death to America death to America\nAnd I played a clip from a CBS News report about this and the reporter says after the deal was signed a in Moscow all over the country or they were shouting death to America but more\nOut of habit than out of conviction what the hell does that even mean they're still chanting death to America after we did this Iran deal yeah put more out of habit then out of conviction how do you know what their conviction is\nYou are okay with that but now you're starting to New York\nNow your New York ... now you're George Patton\nNow George now now a President Trump is being a being a worst he'd been pushed around he's not hawkish enough I thought your complaint was\nThat he couldn't be trusted with the bomb with the button because he was volatile now he's taking his time getting the data recognize that we've got a complicated relationship with Saudi Arabia they had been helping or in dealing with Iran the number one sponsor terror they're afraid of Iran we do have some common interests\nSo the president is considering all of this being deliberate and now he's being trash for that you can't you really can't when and\nWhen I'm watching MSNBC hall and CNN and all of them criticizing the credit for not more forcefully condemning the Saudi what is it you want to do you want to end the relationship\nYou want to walk away\nYou have any idea what they're doing to help us uh in dealing with the the threat of of Iran the number one sponsor repairing the country I Know they\nTalk out of out of both sides of their mouth I Know they've not been reliable ally no this is an unhappy marriage but that's the middle east\nIt's Chinatown Jake I'm Sorry what do you want him to do\nThe same people who cheered Obama win against the objection of his entire national security team he pulled out all the troops\nOut of Iraq you what's your dream chief at the front and don't do it secretary said don't do it took me a defense that don't do it see I said don't do it the national security advisor said don't do it our ambassador to Iraq said don't do it\nThe joint chiefs one of them spoke up publicly when it was over and said had there been a stay behind force ISIS would've been dealt with you guys are okay with that but now Donald Trump have got to be tougher militarily get outta here Reagan was a warmonger George W.
