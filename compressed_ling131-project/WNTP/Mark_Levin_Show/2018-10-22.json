Americans left right Democrat Republican\nA and of course he's ... he's been publicist or was at the time for a Russian for the son of the Russian oligarch we pop star remember I've done a lot of investigating ... Trump Tower\nI find that the Russians there are highly connected to fusion GPS\nActually had dinner I had dinner the day before the day of the day after with using GPS which financed which put out the dust ca financed by Hillary financed by the DNC and then also even more than that I found out one of the participants\nTook a train in the morning with a Hillary associate who worked with using a GPS and then with him right after the meter so many questions here let's get immediately to my recorded interview wish you are now going to hear in full with the publicist Rob Goldstone was set up the meeting was a witness to the Trump Tower meeting\nAnd more take a listen\nTo the Trump Tower meeting so much intrigued us so many questions and\nReally is so much information one way and or and the other but actually we're joined right now\nBy individuals who was inside the tower during the meeting and more than that actually his email a famous we started at least in the media the whole Trump Tower issue and so I joined me is the author of recently read this book is called\nHow in email trumped my life and really that title is very accurate\nFrom what I understand a subtitle is pop stars pageants and presidents are Rob Goldstone who is the publicist who sent the email or to Donald Trump junior again how an email trumped my life available at Amazon dot com\nRob Goldstone a welcome to air inclined investigative radio\nHey Eric nice to be a\nSource so you know I almost don't even know where to begin with is because we can begin with\nA Trump Tower meeting we can begin with the email or we can be again because I read your book we can even began in Moscow in two thousand Thirteen so so why don't we uh jump around let's start with and I know we should start with the email well let's start with\nThe Trump Tower meeting June to thousands sixteen or if you can take us inside them and first of all a who was in the meeting that you can recall [noise] well you\nKnow it's interesting I was just listening to you and your introduction\nAnd it made me think of um filming a friend that says to me over the last year which is um\nI watched the Woody Allen movie ballet and I don't know if you've seen that but it's where the man so to move into all these historical places and suddenly appeared and suddenly those I mean I'm kind of Robert ... valley like Everytime you mentioned something\nOh I was there like Trump Tower meeting I was in the email that with me ... go with me\nIt's so bizarre on many levels which we showed up\nBut going for him telling me that\nThe most important thing for me was the fact that I was never supposed to be that as people who read the email and the you know the ... the bucks change you know my job was really to get to meet thing and uh after that I was to hand it off\nAnd it was one of those perfect storm type event that\nWhen a when I greeted the people who will come into the main thing one of them who I've met before I ... who works for my clients family so to me rub you you've met don't June and before we take cars up so he introduced me to the Russian it's in the ...\nGuy on just a list the scene here is this uh where where is this happening is this in the long view on the hour exactly\nIn the lobby of Trump Tower and so he comes in with the Taliban and the guy who would be a need for whom the meeting was full and she has brought with her a translator and the Callie I took notice of who or what they were I merely said hopefully you have ID and we don't get\nStuck and fix your say um I got them through security and I took them up that uh we waited a few minutes and they they were like go to Judy tourists taking photos out of the windows of Trump Tower stealthy than\nIt was all but the real really uh even though the viewers quite spectacular and don't junior can a couple of minutes later and because I'd met him a couple of times they had nowhere to be shut my hand I introduced him\nTo I who I met before who was the ropes representative my clients represents the [noise]\nI was getting ready to leave and don't said to me hey why don't you just sit in and you can take them out of the ad it'll only be a short meeting anyway\nAnd I took that to me look we've squeezed into me thing wouldn't it be good if you with that so you could you kind of the people out at the end and I thought it was a pretty fair with class so I said not a problem\nSo okay I just want to set the tone here because there's so much information being thrown around so first of all so you're in the Trump Tower a lobby and then a year with ice cool I understand\nI'm as you said ... works for uh the Russian billionaire ... all the guards and also the sun but specifically the the real estate company of uh the the all of\nA a layer of\nCause then also outside with you I turns out is Natalia vessel in the sky up but then with her is re not ... who is the Russian lobbyist to works along with her\nTo counter what's known as the Magnitsky Act which sanctions Russian officials over the alleges that the death of a tax accountant\nAnd then also is a and and ah Antonio or some some core of so many yeah that'd be learning something yeah yeah so uh he's out there with you\nA and he's the translator or in a totally out\nSo you guys all go up a and we're going to get to the email where this whole thing is set up so so you go up and where where in Trump Tower or do you go into is is this a conference room conference room yes losing their\nRole and then when we go in there was a coal miner for and what the time was the chairman of the Trump campaign and Jared coach now I'm I'm sure most people do\nAnd I'm Don junior and myself and this group of Russian by both them and that was it you know I sat next to Jared Kushner a poll manifold starting next to Don June the town of the head of the table and officers with this group of ah of Russian that have come it\n[laughter] so okay and work again going to get to the email and a bit but the email did say that I'm ... that the meeting was offered to provide quote the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary\nAnd her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father meaning to dawn juniors father he said this to you sent this to Don Don junior\nOr to set the whole meeting up you're outside you go and so let's get to the actual content as you remember ... of of the meeting first of all who did the talking so the tool\nKing was ... was mostly done by Italian from the sky only pet food with Don Giovanni a welcoming every body\nAnd uh as you'll hear planes who won't he asked the crowd to present whatever it was she had to say I'm an and I should add here I was I hop a narrow because\nI Know it's hard for people to understand that I really didn't care about with me in the flights of my job was to get the main thing I found myself in that kind of by default I was checking my email I was when I was keeping often they're opening case to be honest in case I heard something that would interest that\n[laughter] so um\nAnd you know why not versed in politics I'm not stupid so I thought if there was something that kind of smoking gun or something of interest I Would note to if I didn't recognize the wood angle the friday's angle or what it meant\nI Would see a change in body language I think people react differently if they if they get excited by something\nSo don't introduced a a daughter that's how it is to introduce what it was she had to say and she started talking about how\nPeople like Bill browser who I've never heard of under this brother who I've never heard of\nWe're making large donations to the Democratic campaign bald that candidate which was Hillary Clinton and how outrageous as well because that would tax food do you want to do something about invasion of taxes and\nThese were very they seemed like very general remarks about how kind of outrage was that these types of people would make these donations\nTo end by the way I also want to point out that this time this was two thousand sixteen everything that you just said wasn't not only a matter of public record it was very well known that\nA bill Browder was a donor to the Democratic party ended Hillary Clinton so that's not exactly incriminating information and in fact this information was already all over the media um so what can you\nSay that yes I think it was known to everyone except me if it meant nothing to me I'd also never heard of ... the I've never heard of the act\nSo this to me was was was like ... ... what it did seem to be with not terribly interesting and when she was talking in these very general terms about them donating a Democrat I remember looking over in don't juniors direction and kind of smiling to myself and thinking\nTerrible too that it in a bit of mystery and just say it's\nDamaging information the information about Hillary the ... and Russian funding but it's always the brow to this\nDay I'll be all protected the Magnitsky Act so that full to me people dismissed the switch but it's all part of the same thing so the ... so that I Would give you yeah she could then bought had been presented to me as I never said that will use that word ...\nBut it was generic and as you say it was even public right but I don't think that not to to what I mean not to do with getting face time with the campaign to talk about what she was a lobbyist school which was to try and lift sanctions for the Magnitsky Act and I just want to say well ... thank\nOf that sort of federal or a light in my mind when I watched um Donald Trump with President ... on the TV in in ... I think ... and suddenly\nMentioned the Magnitsky Act mentioned bill brown and I thought at that time\nWell this over the years in the in the ... and ... it's important to him so of course she would try and get this ... thing and I think the reason the meeting ... so\nKind of a wound up and they thought I did this mystery of how the government or what it what it's all part of the same thing the very people that she believes she had on a quote someone else who would do it all\nWas bill Browder under this brother that was how did the same thing it just walk with her than about what\nThe media has harped on this meeting repeatedly to claim that this was evidence of collusion between the Russian government and on and the Trump campaign and collusion what they're talking about here\nIs an attempt to steal an election these are very a serious charges is accurate and all hands ring on age twenty minute meeting\nWith a Russian attorney and other people who as you just sat and we're speaking with Rob Goldstone was inside the meeting and set it up or they did not present themselves as\nWorking on behalf of the Russian government collusion is a serious thing I mean again colluding to steal an election so you were inside the entire time you listen to every word or you know you say you're kinda tuned out because it was boring\nBut I Would assume that if if what the Russian government work come looting with the Trump campaign just feel an election\nObviously you would remember that so when you were in there for the twenty minutes that you hear anyone colluding to steal any election\nThat cliffhanger more with Rob Goldstone ... states [noise]\n\n[noise] was that\nSorry news I Am now the main terms right around the corner president it turned out campaigning for Republican candidates he'll be in Houston on Monday Wisconsin on Wednesday\nIn Charlotte North Carolina on friday us national security adviser John Bolton faces two days of hiking in talks in Moscow starting Monday after President Trump announced to withdraw from a landmark nuclear weapons treaty comes now committed the U.S would leave the intermediate range nuclear forces or ins treaty\nHas brought sharp criticism from Russian officials in from former Soviet president gourmet champion sign a treaty back in eighty seven\nWhen President Reagan down Britain's defense secretary said his country stands absolutely rented Lou with President Trump getting Williamson blamed Russia for violating the pack he's calling on the Kremlin to get its house in order\nFor more details on these stories and much more visit ... dot com\nBoom\nNews talk nine Ninety rather cooler than seemingly they moon that guy ... there will be free that later on he said he killed looking ahead of the kind of the week a cool one thousand sunshine for Monday nights at the fine thank you partly cloudy lie to say Hi to the wind and Wednesday\nSigning clouds high for the poor keep up the day when the weather\nAnd then he read it might have been married for ... news talking nine Ninety dot com\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens when you called select quote life\nFor example Georgia's forty he was getting sky high quotes from other companies because it takes ... to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found\nHim a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select quote agent dance to be you know and believe me there ... and shopping for your life insurance you're probably paying too much\nMore you're free quote called eight hundred six or seven thirty five fifty one eight hundred six or seven thirty five fifty one eight hundred six or seven thirty five fifty one or go to select quote dot com since Nineteen eighty five we shop you save\nGet full details on the example policy of flood hotel complex commercial surprise could vary depending on your health insurance company the factors tolerable and I'll say\nThe Philadelphia this shopping club has half price tickets to the laser do in Lancaster county for leisure time\nHigh tech family fun and an awesome parties have laser do\nNow you can get forty dollar tickets for half price money buying laser laser frenzy fun prize arcade or mini golf or just twenty by the norm is fine go to new song nine Ninety dot com and click on the Philly discount shopping that\nSmoke alarms are widely available and affordable yet Pennsylvania's seized dozens of fire related deaths each year smoke alarm save lives did just that simple at least one of these life saving devices should be installed on each\nFloor of your home smoke alarms should be tested monthly and batteries changed every six months if you're not sure how to maintain a smoke alarm call your local fire company\nFor more information and fire safety tips visit the fire safe\nP.
