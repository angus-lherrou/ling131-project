Sarah Sanders a wonderful moving moment then into the um and then into the jackals questioning or about why it's all\nI I just I've got a shoe on something and you're ready or the beginning 'cause I'm just I've just absorb is myself and look I I don't\nI don't really care what is in Shepard Smith brain I often care even less about what what comes out of his mouth but at Fox News you have to know something and and I don't know what the deal is is there is there a\nA a a turnover in either the leadership change or a change of flavor is it ... because I mean Hannity still Hannity the addition of shows like Laura Ingraham the magnificent of of of Brett Baer doing special report\nA Tucker Carlson is just a star and and I just love it love him and it's not like I necessarily need all my conservative shows\nTo have exactly the same take because even as conservative as Republicans ... there are there are shades and nuances and ... and things that we we don't all we don't walk in lockstep like Democrats do I envy them at some time but but we don't but what am I leading up to here\nI I just I Need you to absorb a minute and a fraction here\nOf of shepherd Smith\nNow this is science friday listeners there there'll be opinion shows and there are the news shows\nBut look there they're all ... ... maybe ... from the Newseum is show that Fox does is special report with Brett Baer where you basically get a straight dose of news and then a panel of people have a wide variety of views who discuss it and that's great\nHannity conservative opinion show Laura Ingraham conservative opinion Joe Tucker Carlson conservative opinion show Martin I'm a gallon playing more more straight and and less of of of her opinions and it's great and they're all grey who want the hell is that in that our was Shepard Smith just who watch is that\nYou got the starship enterprise set may cover breaking news and and ... is a talented man he has a compelling broadcaster\nFought in the world compels them to do list today\nThe U.S will deploy some five thousand troops to the southern border as early tomorrow as thousands of migrants make their way north from Mexico\nThe migrants according to Fox's reporting are more than two months away\nIf any of them actually come here [noise]\nTomorrow is one week before the midterm election\nWhich is what all of this is about\nThere is no invasion\nNo one's coming to get you\nThere's nothing at all to worry about\nReally now\nObviously of look what I Do for a living everyone's entitled to an opinion obviously this is a mockery of Americans not all of them necessarily conservative most of them probably are that right there was a mockery\nOf you\nIf you think thousands of people pouring across the border is a bad idea I don't expect that they're going to set up a you know and MS Thirteen headquarters next door to my house I don't expect that but you know a hundred thousand of them will come pouring across the border like some remake of World War Z\nBut I Do expect\nThat if we don't make a strong message that this caravan will come and if it is successful and breaching our borders been others will follow\nAnd I do not need weasel lectures from the likes of shepherd Smith about how my concerns are are somehow still is titled ... view he absolutely is I Would expect it\nFrom from psychopaths like Lawrence O'Donnell\nAnd and from finger wagging scolds like Rachel Maddow I Would expect it from that\nAnd again and and I just wanted to I I don't need Fox News to be a heat\nYou know which we all subtle for for just the same exact echo chamber news every day I I I liked diversity of opinion I like 'em but they did they give this guy a show I think given the sinking show every day to insult the Fox news base\nAnd I just want you to know it ain't by accident is intentional they know he's doing it and they wanted him to do it why you'd have to ask them\n[laughter] okay let's see here let me do a call and the ... with a break come back and you'll hear Sarah Sanders and then the media jackals doing after ... after we were in LA rich hey Mark Davis in for Larry welcome how are you\n[noise] [noise] Hi thank you very well my\nI don't remember but it means that can do or anybody listening to my go for it or for\nThat one year old I watch the news and especially when I catch a they've credit score I\nGet so mad after he got off the TV and I have to go meditate\nBecause I'm not going to you by white understand and I\nGet mad and I talked to other people and they get mad I have a real question here who created this credit score who\nVoted all these guys in the ... and then how in the old do they ever get to say they represent me\nThat I Know that they and they and they know it and they don't care now and and I mean they're not supposed to quote unquote represent us in the way that elected officials do they are supposed to cover news in an unbiased and professionally honest and corrupted matter\nAnd the media have not done that successfully in at least a couple of generations and ...\nBillion I or go have you not hurt Americans want you know [laughter] now here we ... we represent the American populace hello now\nAnd and it's and and as the ... rich ... thank you I mean there are ... opinion shows I Love the opinion shows the conservative opinion shows tend to show up on Fox obviously the liberal opinion shows I mean ... I mean listen I just took a little ...\nDonald and Maddow and Chris Matthews and that whole coven and and and and and and that\nTotal head case Joe Scarborough but did they get to be over there on MSNBC and do the Trump hating fire of their viewer base of course they do of course they do and it's a free country and and there's a marketplace out there and\nAnd they've got X number of viewers and Fox has X number of viewers and and the trolls over on CNN at X. number of viewers and they're all trying to slice of pie and get as many folks who they can sell advertising and make a buck\nGood for them that's all just fine\nBut remember what reporting used to be\nAll share a secret what do you draw close to the radio real quick\n[noise] I have\nA journalism degree\nPull up I Know I Know I Do University of Maryland Nineteen Seventy nine College of journalism proud of it\nAnd I was at saving somebody's ... I went and uh and and did radio news reporting in Charleston West Virginia soon to elect Senator Patrick Morrisey uh it had a blast my first two years I went to Jacksonville, Florida did some more reporting before the talk show thing drops in my lap\nAnd I guess that's worked out well for everybody but when I was a reporter when I was studying journalism everything was drilled into us even in the People's Republic of Maryland was objectivity present both sides to try to keep your own opinions out of your stories where in the world did that go [noise]\nAlready and here's where I'm at a goes out for a second let you uh catch a couple of messages and come back and the message of Sarah Sanders is very moving in the press briefing and\nThen you'll ah watched the wolves come after her there after right here on the Larry Elder show Mark Davis in today your eye back\nAll true fall [noise]\nSort of the century said\nThat does he have any concern at all that his words\nIs certainly a the president wants to live in homeless for our country is hurting like we've seen 'em in the last several days I find ways to bring our country together and we've seen him do exactly that\nHowever the president is going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties particularly on policy differences you'll continue to see him make that contrast [laughter] ah but he had certainly I think\nThe founders known that to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well\nBut he's also harshly attack some of the very people to receive those bombs in this morning suggesting that the news media is responsible for for the anger in the country how does he do that when the pipe bomb or this was somebody who was the Trump rallies and this is somebody ought to ban covered\nA tax on the media and praise for for the president on\nShooter in Pittsburgh is somebody who was of\nIt seems by the caravan of presidents with so much time talking about what why is he out there\nWhen you say training country why is he out they're very very first\nThing that the president didn't condemn the attacks in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these rigs thank you accent\nIs outrageous that that would be the very first reaction so many people Robert this country the\nOnly person responsible for carrying out\nEither these heinous acts or the individual to carry them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault for the individual who shot up a baseball field of congressional Republican you can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime ...\nBam thank you very very much Sarah Huckabee Sanders toward the when\nWater ... will destroy\nWhat do you poison is covering this this media community yes and people wonder why this course is a is dashed against the rocks\nIt's not because Trump one or the occasional bar but he throws in a tweet or the occasional moment in a rally the entire culture of reporters editors commentators who say that we're currently led by a racist ...\nHate or a a an evil person Howard Dean ... president of the states is evil president United States is evil Howard Dean\nReally that's why discourse is in trouble it ain't Trump's fault Mark Davis in the Larry be right back you're listening to the Larry elders God\nThis is somebody\n[noise]\nThat's\nOur News I'm Keith figures in Washington the defense department says it's sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to harden the southern border against the migrant caravan\nMaking its way through Mexico general ... tells reporters that eight hundred soldiers wearing route on Monday and that the remainder of the troops will be at the southwest border by the end of the week that's in addition to the more than two thousand members of the national guard already providing assistance at the border now\nOfficials say the troops will provide mission enhancing capabilities and we'll be are you now spend comes as President Trump has been tried to focus on the caravan\nThe migrant caravan has been moving slowly north from Central America and its numbers have been when like\nYou had another rough day on Wall street of the ... two hundred and forty five points that closed at twenty four thousand four hundred and forty two that as that lower by one hundred and Seventeen the U.S and he declined seventh see this is as sovereign you\nUsed all nine Ninety whether clearing and chilly tonight but not his windy is today ... tomorrow mostly live fifty seven\nTo ... he won Wednesday mostly not in ...

massacre in Pittsburgh a\nNational scope stories of of of of of this this idiot mailing you know these packages to people for the bomb scare that's terrible uh ... and then you have the folks who you know disrupt a moment of silence in a well meaning moment\nYou have these these these bands of iniquity these caves of a of\nOf hatred and um\nAnd invent them\nPut it altogether it's not that many people as as folks try to an end you'll hear\nIn so many media report so many stories so many articles so many books I'm guessing it's never been worse ah everywhere we we're we're all in hell a discourse does dashed against the rocks nobody's getting along with anybody\nAll of that is a lie all of that is a lot what is going on right now is there is heightened tension\nTo the misbehavior of some because there is a media culture really interested in a bit diverting your attention to it so that they can say look at that guy\nLook at that ... look at that media post look at bat or tweet look at that person doing this saying this to some corner of the public square\nAnd if it's a hateful terrible thing the reason they attract attention to it and want to attract your attention to it is

and of course the media last no time in suggesting that there's a connection between Trump's so called hateful rhetoric and what happened in Pittsburgh indeed what happened with respect to the pipe bomber\nCan we um\nAnalyze that are searching for just a second\n[noise] was there ever an administration that spoke more harshly against the police and the Obama administration\nIs AG Eric Holder\nFalsely argued that the fact that a black criminal defendant who commits a crime compared to a white criminal defendant who commit a similar crime gets a longer sentence and that's true the U.S commission says a black woman a defendant versus a white cream defend it gets into it and about twenty two percent longer\nWould hold her didn't tell you is it the very same sentencing commission to which he referred also that the reason for the longest sentence is is that the average black criminal defendant compared to the average white from the defendant has more Iraq\nAnd judges take rest into consideration when they're determined the sentence so the U.S mission to which Eric Holder refer to making the argument that the longer sentences\nOr were an example of quote pernicious racism close quote failed to mention that the same commission also said the reason for the longer sentences has to do with such intimate factors\n[noise] recall of course President Obama said that if I had a son he would look like Trayvon I Know George Zimmerman was not a cop but he was operating as a neighborhood watch captain\nObama in his speech for the United nations invoked Ferguson and said something to the effect of you know we've got our own problems here in the United states is a place called Ferguson and hands up don't shoot with a complete and total lie\nAnd while the Obama administration completely exonerated the officer in question they also hold the Ferguson police department institutionally racist why well the biggest finding was that the to the Ferguson is about sixty seven percent black\nYet about eighty five percent of those who are stopped on traffic stops are black\nA gap of what Eighteen percent or go against Eighteen points or go racism [noise] the problem with that argument is that as I said before\nThe city of New York about twenty five percent of its population is black get about fifty five percent of those who are stopped on traffic stops black thirty point gap Ferguson police department almost all white three or four cops were black the NYPD street cops majority of them are people of color\nWhy isn't the NYPD if the gap between population and percentage of oh stop by cops is an example of institutional racism why is that New York city twice it's institutionally racist as Ferguson\nAnd the answer is you can't do it based on just those numbers you have to look at\nWhat underlies those numbers\nIn twenty Thirteen during the Obama administration the department of justice has a research arm called the national Institute of justice and they put out a report about race and traffic stops\nSeventy five percent of black motorists admitted that they were pulled over for quote legitimate reasons costs world\nAnd the study found that you name the whole sense whether it's speeding driving without a license driving with a busted tailpipe driving wasn't expire tag you name it a black motorists was more likely to commit than a white motorists and the twenty Thirteen report put out by the Obama administration\nHas said that the differences and stop it does have to do with quote differences in old fending period close quote\nThe\nRabbis at the synagogue where this massacre took place in Pittsburgh\nHas said they don't want Trump to come to Pittsburgh until he renounced is quote white nationalism crossword\nThe president has many many many times denounce racism denounced anti Semitism and when somebody said that his assertion that he's a nationalist meant that he was a white nationalist nudge nudge wink wink teeth and I have no idea what you're talking about\nI have never suggest that I'm a white nationalist I mean national is in the sense that I Am a pro American guy and type ... global this guy nothing would ever to do with race but that of course has not stopped the left of saying that the president is sending a quote dog whistle close quote to races\nListened very carefully\nAnd here the dog whistle are you hearing it now what is our friend Chris Matthews or say admitted\nFor white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist now Chris Matthews\nIs most white people would not vote for a racist\nYou're suggesting that most white people are therefore not racist and it's a country is majority white you're suggesting that the majority racial group in this country is not racist\nAnd I'm sure you feel that black Senate races in Spanish that racist and Asian or not racists where you are really saying this country's not a racist country\nWide ban same with me here Chris I Know I Know you listen to the show why then with the president and a quote dog whistle close cooperation if as you started\nIs for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist\nMeanwhile in New York City there is an inter face memorial for the eleven people killed\nBy this murderer guess who won who was one of the keynote speakers\nI kid you not\nSo President Trump persona non grata but an anti Semitic race hustling Al Sharpton who once referred to juices diamond merchant\nAl Sharpton who is in

really do appreciate is\nLarry ... is always a pleasure to be on with the great the age of south central\nThank you I Want to talk to you first about uh the caravan and then when talking about President Trump's assertion that he can change the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment which has been interpreted to allow an illegal alien to come to this country have a child on American soil and that child automatically become an American citizen but first talk about the care of and\nTell me what legal authority has to put troops on the border\nAbout ... you know a true stopping and invade and in the United states has one of the primary reasons we add troop\nUh dating back to the civil war there's a federal law called the ... comic heart attack that says the U.S military can't be used in the interior of the United states for regular police activity but that's not what\nPresident Trump is proposing to do is proposing to put them on the border to stop folks from illegally invading our country\nProfessor how come previous president having done this I mean this this so called invasion as you put it has happened year after year after year not quite as large but why have another president's done this\nWell because they don't like our immigration laws and they're not willing to enforce them and they don't they don't think about the consequences of what this lawlessness is doing to our society\nLet's talk about consequences professor what happens if somebody gets shot\nWell that's a terrible thing and you know uh uh I'm hoping that that doesn't happen that's clearly what the lab that is a funding this caravan is hoping will happen or even better in their view would be that it were a child so we can get the nightly news running constantly and tell them that we now and election day\nBut the fact of the matter is these people are putting themselves and their children in harm's way abide violating the laws of this country or they claim that they are refugees and we have an international law obligation to consider their claims for asylum\nBut as far as I've been able to tell not one of them is making claims that actually fit the definition the legal definition of refugee they're not fleeing their countries because they are being persecuted because of their political or religious\nOr race or ethnic views\nThey're fleeing their country because they want to go to a place that has a better economy that's not one of the ground for refugee status\nWhy hasn't Mexico stop them even after Donald Trump has told them to even after Donald Trump has said he's going to withhold aid from Guatemala and Honduras my resume I have some sort of economic punishment to Mexico Hochul Mexico hasn't stopped them\nFell in the same international law that were require us to consider their claims for asylum required Mexico to consider their claims for asylum as well uh and Mexico should be stopping now because that was the first country that they entered into illegally to make these refugee claims\nUm but but some of them have and I think Mexico is profit processing knows but some of the uh we don't want to stop and Mexico we want to get all the way the United states which is just further proof that this was an concern about persecution in their home countries if they want a different economy to live and and that's not a ground for refugee status\nWhat would happen professor if we allow fourteen or seven thousand so called migrants took to transport themselves through our country to go on the way up to Canada\n... candidate would stop him as well same reasons you know there there are legal processes in place here in countries have the ability to define a you know what their immigration and naturalization policies are\nIf if you don't allow that then they're ... you have no such thing as a nation you have no such thing as sovereignty President Trump is absolutely correct on that Without Borders you have no nation\nExplained the ground for which people can apply for asylum\nWell you've got to have a credible claim that you are being persecuted or under threat of persecution based on your political views your religion your um your race\nOr your ethnic background those sorts of things just being poor and wanting a better life is not a ground for refugee status for asylum under international law and certainly not under any of the law the United states\nThe president professor has said that there may be some bad guys there including maybe people from ISIS or even al ... is there any basis to believe that\nWell we we've seen some reports of that I I'm not privy to the intelligence but it wouldn't surprise me\nThat border is porous and if you're stopping people at the port of entry on the east coast in New York or what have you and vetting them properly or than than folks that are ... aiming to come here to the United states to do with terrorist harm\nWould would pay more poor entry and that Mexican border is right now the poorer than tree so it wouldn't surprise\nMe to find a significant number of potential terrorists and that group\nI guess the professor John east wind up Chapman University school of law professor what about funding you mentioned that this Margaret a caravan as being funded by the last what do you mean\nAbout you know it may take a lot of money to transport seven thousand people to feed them every day\nUh you know over the span of faith that they've gone and that's ... I Want to know who's funding it and if they were felt poor in their country that they couldn't you know eke out a living who's paying for them to eat on the ... along the way somebody must be doing it and quite frankly it's most likely\nYou know you you just kind of go to the explanation that makes ... that it's most likely somebody that is trying to interfere with the U.S election by setting up a confrontation that tend to meet new media can turn a contrary to President Trump and his supporters\nLet's turn to the fourteenth amendment here's what President Trump said only immigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without tension ... to ...\nHave you thought about that is telling all it was always told me that you need is a constitutional amendment one and the number one number one you don't need as much as well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas is ridiculous and it has to end have you talked about that with counsel\nWearing the party says in the process it will happen\nWith an executive order does that's what you're talking about\nI didn't think anybody but I knew that but me I thought it was the only one China just couldn't get\nProfessor each mention he do this with an executive order\nWell either leaving ... what's your your or first principles the president cannot amend the constitution and executive order Congress can amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court isn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by issuing a judgment or ruling in a cave\nBut that's not what the president is talking about here\nThe constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship it's anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizens all he's trying to do with clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction mean\nAnd it doesn't mean anybody who happens to be subject to our laws because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete they're mad owing allegiance to the country being part of the body politic\nAnd that's what the debate of the fourteenth amendment make clear that's what the early Supreme Court decisions on that's made clear and the Supreme Court has never held otherwise\nAre we now felt so that would mean that the children of citizens\nOr the children of lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment but the children of temporary visitor whether it's a tourist visa or student visa\n... um or or or certainly the children are people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic citizens according to the constitution and the president is trying to faithfully apply that clause that it was drafted and ratified and and as it meant to the people that path\nThat forty five seconds left professor I thought there was some sort of Supreme Court case that came out in the early eighties have some sort of footnote which people point to to argue that anybody who's in the country even illegally has a child on the American soil a is an automatic citizen isn't there some sort of case that people point to that rightly or wrongly they use to make that argument\nThey do take called ... and it's the ridiculous case had said that states have to provide\nFree education to the children of illegal immigrants under the equal protection clause and excited a footnote that says look they're they're they're awful citizens if they're born here but that was not a holding of\nThe case it was added issue in that case it was just what we called ... that the Supreme Court just with the back of the had added something\nOr forty believes even worse they're only about Fifteen Percent\nOf households in the Silicon Valley area can afford the median price Tom in that location so there's no there's no sense in which um there's ... there's there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about the ... and they're looking for government to to put in place policies\nThat will make it easier and less costly to build a increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor I I got a fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about\nUm the ... the high cost of a of a of regulations and said that if you add up the taxes and regulations are all those things government takes about fifty percent away from the American people I've got a phone call from from some fact checker\nAnd they said how you know the cost of regulation is what'd you say it is\nA and I'm a I recommended them to a number of people and I recall you telling me that if anything I'd probably under state in the ah the number and the arguments they gave me was that regulations also have benefit and and you're not taking exaggeration the benefits of these regulations produce what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well regulation exist to provide protection is supposed to provide protection to consumers\nRegulations in the housing market [noise] when I look at them I really can't see much a protection for consumers I'm most take California's\nLatest folly which is to require by two thousand twenty of virtually every single family home will be required have solar panels on its roof top\nThis will raise the cost of a building that home a by about thirty thousand dollars [noise]\nAll for the purpose of generating solar power we already have so much solar generation that we are paying Arizona to kick solar power offer hands around around new a new one PM [noise] um that type of regulation feeds into [noise]\nA small number of people in the state who think it's just absolutely wonderful if we do everything we can under the sun to be green um but it\nPunishes people who have to pay those housing prices um so the\nResidential housing market in California is not a place regulations really benefiting consumers\nI'm
