understood at the Democratic party at an absolute stranglehold on the black community now and the mind that uh for about six years and they had no intention of ... what is going to take what you like them to get out of their boats\nAfghan though\nBut but to my point you you had a caller ask you how many legal\nImmigrants are accepted into this country and um and I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico we as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what situation it but that was about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay

know I don't know directly or indirectly through a lot of people um\nOr veterans them and people in in the White House no trade ... was the main reason why this information to knock it out about\nGeorge Bush didn't want it out for about the terrorists would know about those stockpiles I go looking for them and use them on our own soldiers mhm fall time that he was taken all that heat it was taken up to protect our soldiers and Marines\nAnd our airmen and our navy or sailors right\nAnd that's why I call leadership\nWere Ryan thank you very much for that I'm trying to hurt or it said too that the reason the president did not force we talk about the presence of these chemical weapons was because of that fact that the bad guys would know where they are and we're going to get them\nI was chairman for half a decade of the G O P s state party and we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happens that's not an indication of a\nOf a deep blue state where a purple state and\nAnd then by the way and this is one of the important things that if you actually when the Senate race\nOr that could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and what is it one one now yeah both and so ... would change one seat there and then makes a world of difference I'm Sorry go ahead\nIs on it lately right if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot or that is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats who have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialists [noise]\nThey don't want this new vision that has been so articulated by the Seattle city council a lot of your listeners around the country heard about that head tax that they pass\nAnd uh we were ridiculed across the country for it because they were going to fight homelessness by basically forcing employers to lay people off because they couldn't afford to pay this hadn't tax to the city and that's the kind of crazy ridiculous taxation that people in this state are fed up with and\nAnd your opponent is on record of wanting\nHigher tax rates absolutely and she voted against the tax cuts in jobs fail she said she would rescinded\nA there is like all these big government Democrats there is not attack they don't love it's another way to get people's money\nAnd the people in this country are seeing a new way and that thanks to Donald Trump kind of it doing with his policies out but it hasn't been done in a very long time and I particularly loved in our state and across the country that\nUnemployment rates are so low for our ethnic and minority communities\nAnd I again you're you're running a very vigorous campaign you're out there all the time you you can't match I'm Maria in terms of money I mean she's been there three full terms in the U.S Senate\nUm what's ... what would be your first priority if you actually won this thing\nWell we have a lot of priorities in this state and uh a lotta people may not realize that we were inundated with forest fire smoke based on very bad policy if they keep us from clearing out the under brash and getting rid of that tender or it's ready to explode the moment there's a forest fire we have had\nCatastrophic forest fires in our federal for us and that's got to change and that's one of the first things I Would do another thing is we are really hurting when it comes to transportation\nYou know and because our state is so poorly respected in the halls of power we have very little cloud to bring home any kind of money from the federal government and I said I can bring home that the federal dollars for infrastructure that my opponent has been unable to do\nWas harshly because he can work with the Trump admitted to directly and and but also partially because I think you share with the Trump Administration a desire to move us to fixing our roads rather than building new choo choo train those are friends ... refers to them yes uh that actually go nowhere\nExactly you know we're on the cusp of a very exciting time and transportation a cleaner cars and and the ability to use a\nA phone app I Can't find a drivers and writers in order to\nDouble and triple up in car pools like we've never seen before you know kind of an ... like\nVersion of transportation for the community and there's so many new innovative things that are coming down the road it's just a shame to use afraid it's just a shame that we spend so much time wasting billions of dollars on a\nOn not getting our folks to and from work and back home to visit with their families for the rest of the day so I'm I feel very strongly about this there's there's another thing that really affects all of that and this is nationwide it's bringing down the cost of higher education\nAnd we know the federal government has had a major role in increasing those costs and uh we've got to step in the time has come and it's an issue that I think all of that around the country are going to be working on\nAnd what are what are some of the promising ways you could bring down the ridiculous cost of higher education well the\nThe biggest one is that a federal use of loans uh that has allowed the cost at the university is to go skyrocketing\nNo of course was a federal government under writing all all of these loans including for people who just go for a year or two and don't even have a college degree to

please welcome back to the program [noise] Sally Sally how you doing I'm well thank you very how are you\nI'm doing great I'm Sally a Bernie Sanders wants Medicare for all can you give us your analysis of what this would do\n[noise] yes it would be a complete disaster as if you know Larry I'm Canadian I grew up in Canada under a single payer\nI started a publication back in Nineteen eighty eight\nI'm I'm waiting your turn a guide to waiting lists the average Canadian family um wait Twenty one point two weeks from thing a primary care doctor\nTo getting treatment by specialist Bernie Sanders wants the Canadian health care system is eat that Medicare for all the time has come he wants the Canadian system but even more he wants to add vision care free drugs\nAnd um and and and and feed vision care and and um you know of course he he has a bill before the Senate which had sixteen co sponsors for whom want to become president and of course he never talks about what it would cost and how it would be paid for\nBy the Charles ... center said thirty two trillion dollars over ten years all private coverage\nUnder his plan Larry would be outlawed and you know a hundred and sixty million Americans have employer sponsored insurance and the polls show they like it they would all lose their coverage immediately and we would all be\nLike people in the u._k. under the national health service Canada under Medicare system\nThe on waiting list or care would be rationed and our taxes would have to be increased significantly\nSelling how would why why does a Medicare for all seem to test so well among Democrats\n[noise] well I think you know Bernie started this back in twenty sixteen\nI'm Single payer has been around Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenty sixteen when he was running against Hillary for the Democratic presidential nomination he brought out his first single payer plan you know telling the American people it would be free and they would have the best healthcare and all and so\nYou know the mainstream media picks up on this and plays it over and over again that you know who wouldn't want something that's free but as I say he never talked\nAbout how it would be paid for and how much it would cost and so and then he has of course\nIs I'm a new young sidekick Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\n... member of the Democratic socialist with America\nShe is going around with Bernie telling candidate you\nKnow promoting candidates who support single payer and so it's really a being a very big move to the left for the Democratic party and I think we're going to see in this midterm election on November six\nAre these candidates who are running to the left\nBen Jealous or for governor of Maryland this I'm Andrew Gillum who is running against um [noise] the Santa's for the governorship in Florida how do these people do to the American people\nAre they finally understanding by people like you and me tell educating them on how terrible it to be what the cost to be their tax burden\nAnd you know in the latest poll um study out of the American association of medical colleges\nThey're predicting a shortage of a hundred and Twenty one thousand doctors\nBy twenty thirty because so many dogs that trauma sixteen percent increase so\nMany dogs you know quit medicine under Obamacare but the thought of being under a single payer system where Bernie says they would be paid forty percent below\nWhat they're paid now um because they their salaries their payments would be tied to Medicare for this will encourage more doctors to quit and the best and brightest young people not to go into medicine\nShall we talk to me about a pre existing conditions I thought it was an assault on the on the insurance model to force insurance carriers to take people with preexisting illnesses now hearing Republicans say hey hey Democrats don't say that we're going to take away preexisting conditions because we're not I'm confused\nWell I Know it's very confusing and of course it's all goes back to the fact that when Trump was running as president and the Republicans were running in the twenty sixteen presidential they promised that they would repeal and replace Obamacare unfortunately you know by the early fall at twenty Seventeen they hadn't been able to do it and it wasn't done\nUm we're seeing some very good things being done through the administration secretary Alex aides are you know expanding I'm short term a limited ration plans association health and a lot of things are happening but this issue of preexisting conditions keeps coming up and the Republicans I think those\nThat are in tight races are getting squishy on the issue and being at that point is that there are only about six\nThirty who

I just kind of mentioned ... detective game would whose undercover narcotics officer he's the one that made this all happened if it wasn't for him none of this would have ever come to light and in fact as you said you know and it's true the FBI and the d._a. where only focused very much on the drug case\nBut Jim Woods said what about this woman who died this woman kind of my monger who died why don't we why are we talking about her\nAnd because eventually because of gyms perseverance and they actually ... opened up the ... the the the homicide investigation into the death of kind of my mongering once you once they did that and we're allowed to search for evidence in connection with her death they found everything out\nThe other of course big point of the movie is that initially the mainstream media didn't care about this case yeah it's amazing and the reason I didn't care about it because it makes them have\nVery unpleasant thoughts about abortion and they don't want to go there no\nNo they don't want anything that might in fact you know ruled by you know have any effect on her all the way it and this film certainly do some ... ... am portray abortion in a very good light because you've got to hear about abortion and you don't hear it for a pro life activist you hear it from two of the you know during the trial to ... to legal abortion is rafts on the fans describe it good abortion\nAnd when the when the jury heard what good abortion sounded like they didn't see much of a distinction between that and murder\nMhm um I ask you this before when we interviewed a golf now Rick regarding the the drug stuff I'm sure he he he's aware that was illegal I'm sure you got he's got conscious of consciousness of guilt about that what about the abortion I got the impression he didn't think he'd done anything morally wrong\nNo not at all in fact you know he feels he will be vindicated that he was helping the poor women you know that he you know that he really is a hero to the poor\nYou know at some level he ... certainly claims that that's the case you know when he I mean even worse by the way and I know we're at Salem Radio station I mean can you imagine he also had scripture passages have given me scripture passages that justify abortion to justify what he did he's written poetry pruning when one of the ... he wrote pruning and you can imagine\nThat reference he was using that that we need to prove and for things to grow well I mean I really extraordinary but he's you know match to me he is a complete lunatic but it's all the people that are enabled him to make a make for very chilling reading and very chilling knowledge\nAnd medical him he is my guest she is the co producer of the movie ... the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer I've seen it it is a moving deep disturbing film I urge you all to see it did you ever speak with Dr Carson\nYeah I've been in the prison so I spent about three hours with him and um\nYou know ... it's it's amazing he actually lives up to all the cliches of a serial killer he's like Hannibal Lecter he has this very soft voice he's very highly educated cheap you know how the whole thing about its hands you'd have to look at how big my hands are his whole thing about his feet which of course becomes very chilling when you realized he cut the feature of children and kept them in jars\nHe sang to me twice he touched my leg inappropriate to continuously\nAndme and he has this really soft voice and he has the demeanor is so here he is in prison forever and never going to see the light of day again\nAnd freedom and he had the demeanor like he's just come off the golf course he has this very relaxed and he's smiling all the time and but every now and again when I asked him hard questions he would do this kind of brain freeze and go oh\nYou know ... like in an extremely creepy way you know so he's yeah he's every kind of creep actually\nI don't believe your movies showed his wife no that's correct uh she was married for she aware of what was going on\nThey're not ... not only was she aware of what what what's going on she was involved so in fact it's actually one of the most awful parts around what are we leave her out of the movie\nBecause you couldn't include everything's so we'll have to you know there's plenty of self left on our movie and she was one of them I mean it and also actually bringing her and mix it really dark because she was involved in what they called the Sunday babies when the clinic would completely empty of every of all the other workers and he and her\nWe see what they called the most difficult cases which was people up to nine months and we knew about that\nAnd because people would see some of the remains the following day and stuff so she actually went to prison ... but only for a short period because she cooperated with the authorities children\nYeah seven children from three different vibe if any of them involved\nNo none of the children involved um seven children three different wise yes\nYeah but none of the children you know in fairness none of the children were involved in the youngest child the youngest child was with a high school student too and you know was there during the raid on the house\nOr we don't have a few seconds left and what is his reputation now in Pennsylvania specifically Philadelphia black community what's his reputation now\nWell I think you know he he he now has the correct reputation for being a for being an animal in a monster but I Would urge people to go and see the movie and they can find a local listings Wisconsin movie dot com and don't be scared don't be scared because I Know you're hearing me failed and stuff but actually that's a lot of that's in the book on the worst stuff in the book the movie is PG Thirteen anyone\nCould watch and ... the movie is called God's nails the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer I urge you to all see it and thank you very much for coming in I appreciate it first great CSI committed Dana Rohrabacher up next I'm Larry Elder Larry over\nAll through all of a [noise]\nCongressmen what about this migrant caravan how big a factor is that [noise]\nWell I think that that ties right into what we're talking about was Trump when people begin to understand that we have a guy a tough guy like Trump as our president it gives us some kind of confidence that\nWe're not going to our people our country will not be invaded and are Democrats or earning or doing nothing but attacking the mayor jacking open other Republicans\nThese folks are their their act as if this invasion of our country does the U.S and tracked why Poland\nUh this guy earlier Wilder\nUh as ended up saying that it off or get here or there are here illegally we're going to be giving them Medicare don't lose our government benefits will surprise surprise what we actually we lived in Latin America we have families what we do anything to get them here\nIf I got the politicians all the time\nThe finance health care and education and other benefits what were the trader on people\nWho can't do that we got to be loyal to people like her father my father worked so hard to make sure we had a good education and they said if I people overseas they went overseas and save up for the Japanese military restricted sex\nBut the fact is they loyal to the American family which is a United States every race or religion every ethnic group we are Americans that's saying a lot of people\nThat our president is a tough guy he's watch out for us and some people on the other side of the line or not watching out for America they have some kind of interest or other interest on\nMy guess is congressman Dana Rohrabacher California forty eighth district he's running for re election in tough districts your opponent got the endorsement of progressive Democrats of America and he signed off on every one of the groups are a\nBig positions on their questionnaire including things like reparations for slavery Medicare for all I mean this guy should be\nPretty easy to defeat in your district I Would think\nAll heard the except what God is a

Larry that I've been desperate to pass on is it that we are not paying attention or having any discussion regarding our healthcare system about the irresponsible and costly use of that system\nLarry Ann in a one ambulance ride if you call you vomited watch is three thousand dollars\nAnd Canada everybody pays according to your wages soccer making ten dollars an hour here might have to only pay twenty five dollars a month if they're making thirty\nYou're going to pay maybe eighty nine hundred dollars a month\nBut everybody is covered now we don't have a doctor's waiting lists is because\nWe only have thirty six million people that live in our country right how many doctors are you going to have for thirty six million right and because doctors are limited to okay if you break a leg you only get five thousand dollars for that like if you got a heart oh you're going to get twenty five thousand pot heart\nDoctors move away from Canada because of the capitalism that's down here well hey I can make more money if I come down here and there was a made for\n\nA and Dave are you critical are you or you supportive of the Canadian system\nAre supportive of this Canadian system because I think when they came up with Obamacare here I said why are we doing Obamacare when we already have Medicare right everybody's paying into it right so if we can get the doctors on board and get rid of the insurance companies that are just making money\nRight at how each state has their own medical I don't see why it won't work\nThe whole world is on medical you know except for America\nWell Dave uh obviously I see it very differently I'm a free market guy and I think medical health care a commodity like anything else like fixing a car like a toaster like anywhere else in the more competition for the better quality the ... and a cheaper prices\n[noise] ... yeah like a great with that\nWell I'm a I'm not I'm not sure what we're about to Dave anyway thank you very much for the call I appreciate

colleagues Chris Matthews\nJust conceded most white people would never vote for somebody they thought he was racist\nSo why would President Trump out himself as a white nationalist racist when one of your colleagues on the left who probably knows more about politics and you\nUsed to be speaker to to uh\nWe used to be the press secretary to speaker O'Neal he wrote a book about uh about politics and he says the average white person\nMost white people in this way or the sorry put white people come and most of them would not vote for somebody if they thought he was a racist and if he thought they were racist but I changed the pro now to make it medically correct\nIf he wrong\nDoes he perhaps have a\nIdea of how white people think given the fact that he's been I don't know why all his life and been in politics all his life\nTrump was using that word to describe somebody who is proud of America and a national as opposed to a global is as opposed to somebody who's wanting to subvert our sovereignty to some ...\n... um if he was talking about\nAmerica First jobs first\nRenegotiating bad trade deals and so forth I talk more about this in just a few minutes here's what Adam said about
