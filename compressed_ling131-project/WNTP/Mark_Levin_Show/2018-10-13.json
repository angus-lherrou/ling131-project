with that little segment of Mohammed Ali\nFactor Kurt I remember when caches clay was just becoming popular [noise] uh and he was not popular in our household dad couldn't stand him thought he was bragging mom couldn't stand him thought he was a breaker doors thought he was uncouth you were the only one in the house\nI didn't have an opinion Dennis and they have an opinion one way or the other but you're the only one in the house uh who embrace him and you say you're going to become the next heavyweight champion of the world and dad thought he had a big mouth and we'll get knocked out by Sunday list in\nFact I don't know why I think it was because he was the fastest heavyweight I represent fame and I try to stay out of the way of motion you know heavy punishment I just want to be like\nWell you also thought he was fun and entertaining Kirk and the reason I mentioned that is because shortly before I'm a I'm going to lead died a very close friend of his told me that they were watching the news and ah this is during the the twenty Fifteen is a time around in their twenties Fifteen I think it was twenty sixteen early\nAnd he asked um Mohammed Ali who he supported for president\nAnd you know who said he said Trump\nAnd his before Trump became a real serious candidate and he said quote he's going to shake things up close quote\n[noise] wow he went\nTo Kirk I'm trying to figure out how is it the Kanye West is a sell out an Uncle Tom when Mohammed Ali who's embraced\nLove by the black community or support supported Donald Trump and I'm either nobody knows that um Mohammed Ali supported him or because it's Mohammed Ali they gave them a path I'm not quite sure which it is all I Know is if I'm Tanya with us ally that must make Muhammad Ali one as well\n[laughter] one way to look at it [noise] it's just going to catch what black\nLeaders are or wherever you are saying right now you know give him from plush he needs to kind of put his worst or get a little bit better\nWhat what about the hammering he's getting Kirk a check out this guy this guy's name a bakari sellers he is a democratic strategist that's how they build him on a on a was the on CNN on CNN listen to this\nI'm not sure in using them as a ... per se but what Kanye West of done with Donald Trump is what other people have done who gravitated in his in his orbit which is just\nShower him with adulation for what reason I have no idea um but ... my issue with Kanye West is is quite simple\nUm is that anti intellectualism simply isn't cool and Kanye West these issues as you say to these issues that they're going to talk about our our issues that are that are central issues and many African American communities are very important issues\nBut the fact is we're not sending Kanye West to the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have the depths\nTo I Want to hear what Kanye West wants to do when we're talking about criminal justice reform or prisoner reentry the fact that he cannot he doesn't have that that just the other day\nHe was talking about a spin programs and how we needed to have more than programs that had to turn around and ask his colleague what ... me and so what what is what happens when it was as what happens when they grow don't read 'em and then we have this now\nKanye West of what happens when equals don't read ...\n[noise] I mean it is it's kind of sickening 'cause he made a sample of really good point view rambled them a little bit but he made several good points and discuss them and nobody

white supremacy by been true of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West mouth Kanye West is engaging in one of the most sniff areas practices and yet\nA black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of it and see black sentiments I don't know how much more I can take or\nWhat I found that you notice they talk about the guy sitting next to a cognac Jim Brown yeah mhm not one single word has been mentioned about him and he would fit right next door\nAnd he also Jim Brown said that he does not want to denigrate the flag and where he playing in the NFL today he would not be taken any\nAren't yeah not a word has been said about ...\nWe got him when he got hammered a little bit uh in in black media

tragedy for my dear\nFriend and great artist Kirk I thought Kanye West me and a little bit [laughter]\nI mean he talked about jobs for the black community and stuff and they talk about that we need to focus more on the communities that have not been updated you know maybe get some job some industry or something in those areas she made perfect sense to me\n... one of the things you said was that wearing the mega had made him feel powerful he felt like Superman he said because you grow up without a father and wearing the mega kept gives them a sense of power\nThat David Gergen a is a guy that worked in both Republican administrations in Democrat administration he punted on CNN here's what he said about what Kanye West at about a wearing the ... to feel more masculine I agree with\nWhat your battered by both said a listen I I and and I have no trouble with presidents and call and celebrities or the White House throwing each other's company you know this has started way back where the water and heart in Nineteen twenty calling in al ...\nAnd it goes all the way after Richard Nixon calling in Elvis Presley and with cameras by the way he very much wanted the cameras there are some that that this is\nPart of the present for tradition but I think what you're putting your finger on is is that the judgment that goes into doing it\nIn the face of this horrific storms so much suffering in the country they would have been so much better to postpone Kanye West for personal ... for four or five days a have conversations that person can't go to the people who are suffering some I\nHave a serious conversation in the White House for God's sakes about the relationship of\nStorms the climate change and when we're going to do something serious about that as opposed to having us for ...\nAnd that is what is uh I I think so disturbing I don't know about Kanye West mental condition and I don't know about what I\nWhat I did pick up on something I haven't really thought about he kept saying about this hat and\nPut in his head on and this had on they didn't feel like a man and I kept wondering is that what's going on with some of them in this country and their relationship with Trump is paying for Trump make them feel more masculine I just don't know the answer to that but boy the richer and over time I was in a in a session\nNo for crying out loud Kirk I guess putting

us is some kind of college and product\nWhen we're already over eating protein [laughter] so\nThat doesn't make any sense as an answer what we really need is something that gives them missing ingredient and the missing ingredient is a soluble eyes to form of carrot and\nThen we derived that from shapes will it's God's really great studies showing that it's an important structural protein\nAnd that it really delivers the goods it effectively supports skin moisture elasticity and compact ... as well as overall hair and nail health and string wow\nAnd you know most products as I said earlier are from chicken college in well little if any help because we're already getting so much protein as a nation typically most people need to\nCut down because they're not doing enough physical activity to ... to um deserve or for the body to use that much protein\nAnd you know as we age the skin sins or the hair and nails have increasing difficulty in getting this carrot and the need and that's because it's got to go through the liver\nThan you guys are eating too much of those refined oils\nAnd that's the thing we want to really get a lid on that supposedly heart healthy olive oil coconut oil all and of course ... oil and the and the other oils anytime they press on oil you got a problem so\nOur goal is to cut those down at the same time you support the hair skin and ... and\nJust won five hundred milligrams capsule per day is going to be all you need if you're under a hundred two hundred pounds and if you're over two hundred pounds you got to use it leads to capsules and if you're in a hurry to a good idea to use to capsules for maybe a month or so and then cut back to one capsule and so of course\nOur hair skin and nails because that will be on special today\nSo you'll buy to get twenty five percent off each and we're going to cover many other things that you can do\nTo support the skin including dealing with blemishes and on cystic acme so uh we'll cover more of that right now we're gonna go and begin answering your nutrition and health related questions\nLet's go to Delia in Oregon and she's got some questions about heavy metal go right ahead Delia\nYeah I'd like to try and find out what you have to be a little heavy ... body well with\nHeavy metals ... there's three steps to dealing with heavy metals the first step is to stop being exposed the best you can and that one of my favorite things to do that\nIs take calcium aluminum silly Kate clay unlike the clays that are out there typically they're mostly sodium\nThis guy can trap up to Ninety eight percent of all the weird things that can be in food from insecticides pesticides all manner of junk and so we called is I'm dragging clans LAX\nAnd you would take to capsules an empty it into a cup with about six eight ounces of water\nAnd you want to drink that while you eat your main meal and what this does is it transit the intestinal tract and it traps all of these guys that normally would attach to calcium bonding sites all the toxins it never leaves the intestine\nIt's just the ideal first step\nWhen your deep taxing the body or pay the next step is to do mild things don't remember I said there's zero you got to stop exposure so for you Delia that could mean that you have a silver filling in your mouth do you have silver feelings\nOr I didn't let alone you have them removed okay so now you have white stuff OK okay well the white stuff sadly excrete aluminum so you still have problems so the clay is going to be very helpful there\nAnd also will want to do something to minimize your exposure there what I Would recommend is that you leave those feelings in place\nAnd you have them carries died stained every six months when you have your teeth cleaned and the ones that fail you want to replace them with low fusing ceramic so you'll need to look around in your area\nTo find someone who can do this work you can always call a cure a practitioner usually they work with a dentist and they'll be able to tell you you can also look in the yellow pages and for a dentist who says he has a machine coats Iraq\nCEO already see where they're able to middle a block of low fusing ceramic literally identical to your own truth\nChair side show with only a single and that's that is Asian fake and replace a an inland on late or crown\nAnd that is twenty first century dentistry so we need to deal with that our next favorite thing for promoting the health of the body in detoxification would be Mehdi ... that is a very gentle\nForm of ... instead of being full garrick\nFor ... and it really seems to be a wonderful a help in what you would want is to just maybe take one per day so that it's mild and very easy it doesn't push too hard on the body\nAnd there are even stronger things but if we were to use those I think what you should do is be visiting with a cure a practitioner because they can test you make sure it's not too much for you\nAnd make sure that you have the right dose and of course during this whole process as you want to do your best\nBy measuring the first morning here in the age you want to do your best to keep that as close as you can to the six four seven ozone\nDuring your detox that you're doing for all the weird things that might be in the body you don't want to push so hard that you go asset in staff

eighty eight five eighty eight\nSeventy five Seventy six it's go right back to the phones let's go to Betty emitted as do California and her husband's a struggling with his gall bladder and a stomach was some acid reflux or are you there Betty\nYes I Am not good and how old your husband and how much does the way\nHave any fat it hit me any way\nYeah in fact in five pound\nKey will yet at his age ... it's amazing that he made it that long and now has as reflux but basically the answered reflex is his food he can't make hydro chlorine gas it to digest the food anymore [noise]\nSo what's happened is that food sits in his stomach informs lactic acid that burns like hydro clerk as it [noise]\nSo if you take an acid stops but now the mood routes all the way from the stomach to the ... and you just have a big mess weight gain in your gut and just\nEverything you can think of goes wrong so the first thing you want to do is get him on some digestive support probably to quantum died just at the start of the main meal yes for him because of his age\nAnd then at the end of the meal you want to start with to detain ... and maybe if he tolerates that will go to for if he gets any burning or any problem with the age see I'm just him drink a lot of water it'll stop but they don't want\nThat fact to what they are going\nTo digest the guy that okay\nSo now the with the age sale if

so you don't have to deal with them\nSo just give a buzz ... eight hundred three Seventy four thirty four\nForty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven [laughter] All right\nLet's go right back to the phones let's go to\nRobert in Brentwood, Tennessee and he's wondering how magnesium might relate to bow regularity and his trouble sleeping\nOkay or are you there Robert affair and how old a man or you know how much the way\nI'm sixty six one eighty seven on eighty six\nOkay and when you when you have difficulty going off to sleep or staying asleep or what what's the trouble was sleeping\nYes sir I I'm actually I had a lot of weight loss very rapidly and that's what I see\nAnd then I'm Sorry I lost weight and I'm a doctor tells me at a certain amount of calories and tall I Try to eat meat so proteins and then but I Need the vegetables because I was just the most you know\nAbsolutely need the ball\nBut I Can't eat the tiny enough vegetables or doesn't get me I Can't even I Can't eat that much [laughter] okay so and then he was not sleeping all at night so\nBut what about the let's get back to sleeping do you have difficulty going off the sleepers than sleep\nOh OK offhand stay okay good I got it\nAll right well see the off to sleep is usually linked to the gall bladder\nSo we'd want to support gall bladder and your body size maybe three teaspoons of gall bladder PG usually the first night you observe you can go off to sleep busier okay and this you would use for months\nAnd uh after you have used it three weeks you would begin to coffee and them as per week\nNothing will give you more beautiful here and skin that\nWill just do wonders for you and that lasts for Thirteen weeks that's going to take care of going off to sleep now staying asleep is typically if you're waking up like for no reason not we are you waking up to urinate or you're waking up for no reason\nUm most of the time is Iran I\nOkay well then we should support that so let's go with um the polling floor and see if we can't get you and your body size about oh three per meal and I do that for three weeks\nAnd at the end of the time you'd probably find you're not getting up at all and then you can cut to two at breakfast only okay\nThen the other thing we've gotta do to make sure that it's not rotting food that's waking you up is to get you on digestive support and ... so maybe to quantum died just at the start of the main meal and then the end of the meal about four\nTo five detain hydro chloride now you're dead just seem more like you did as a twenty year old\nSo now I think this should be a tremendous help the lack of the sleep\nWill cause you to excrete magnesium which can tend to make the intestines and the bowels much harder so you could jump on some of our magnesium four hundred and take a couple of teaspoons a morning and night for\nProbably five days and now you should start having very easy to pass foul movements and then I Would\nCut two um two teaspoons am only okay\nAnd I think it should be doing this job for you a lot of people tell me your age so that they prefer teaspoon morning and night rather than taking it all at once and the day because you're still screening till we rebuild those adrenal 's okay [noise] I Hope that's a big help for you and your\nThat is possible but it's unlikely so first thing we would look at would be what do we need to do to promote the best adrenal function\nAnd so there you know there's a laundry list of things these drills need\nBut in particular the number one they want a about half your weight you know says of water so if you're a hundred and fifty eight let's call it a hundred sixty you'd need about eight ounces of water per day how you doing on getting that Robert\nExcellent\nGood okay then the next issue is a little bit of salt\nAnd here we would like air dried sea salt or even better yet are pink salt which is how\nTo solve for the last two years\nOkay a lot and that that wouldn't be my favorite SALT I would ever do you go to an air dried sea salt\nUm and what you want to do is break a sweat from time to time so you can taste the frustration at the upper out are part of your arm it should tastes slightly salty if so salt is perfect\nOkay next issue is ... and of course since childhood I don't think there's any problem with iron because you are normally this problem develops out over the years as a result of eating white flour in white sugar\nAnd so if you've had this from since you were a little kid then I'm not thinking that we've got to worry about iron so let's move on\nAnd then we go to be vitamins now you could be in trouble here if you were a bit of the sugar hall lake as a child did you eat a lot of sweets as a kid and [noise]\nI watch not okay do you know if he were breast fed to term that I was much faster so at least twelve months yes or\nNo good okay so you should be able to make me ... All right that's good show a then the next guy is five hours straight sleep and how do you do with that you're sleeping good\nShops can extract backlash all\nOkay good well then it you know all these things sound really good to me when you wake up in the morning in bed or the feet in the hands still cold\nYes they are okay All right\nThen let's go to circulation so circulation the number one thing you would try at first just to see if it's an issue is you can go on something called Cirque du gold\nThis promotes micro circulation throughout the body\nAnd it's your body weight I Would just go to for premium and just see if in two or three days you have a difference for your hands and feet if you do then I'm going to recommend that you go on the battlefield diet\nAnd use strictly follow it so there's no oil nothing that says occasional rarely you don't eat any of those things for at least thirty days\nAnd see if it now promotes a better circulation to their hands and feet if it does then it's the food that's doing this to you and it sounds like that's the case 'cause it sounds like you've got all the all the things the adrenal is need you could try [noise]\n... me and see if it does any good for you may be a one or two teaspoons per day and just see if that benefits you at all and when you wake up from sleep you feel rested\nYes or\nNo great well if that's true in all the adrenaline things except maybe the B vitamins\nShould be good in it that would rule out the ... in my mind so [noise] um get a copy of the bio field diet what I Would do is just be very strict for thirty days and see if it changes the game if it does then while\nSince childhood then I Would agree that the something or some issue with circulation and I'd get to work on it as quick as you
