I'm just saying I even knew what it is looking at the data and uh just just don't see any Greg if you think I'm wrong call back and correct me\nAnd I've given you the quote from the draft or of that provision subject to the jurisdiction thereof and the fourteenth amendment senator Jacob our hope this will not of course include persons born in the United states who are foreigners\nSomehow some way that fourteenth amendment has been interpreted as meaning that anybody in this country whether legally or illegally better so us on on our daughter on us soil that son or daughter is automatically an American citizen nonsense says the draft or other fourteenth amendment\nAnd a Trump is right that is certainly rare he's wrong when he says we're the only country uh there are others or the other one
