{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "It's going to find out what about this gas tax that a Republican to soon was so unpopular new poll shows that the majority of California and what the California gas tax to say are you kidding me all that's coming up Larry is in Brooklyn New York Larry you were on the Larry on the show you are well name's Cher\nOh you're too Larry I'm too many of us do your okay that Dr for\nYou there's some there's some there's some areas I Know that I liked eliminate [laughter]\n\nYeah oh okay okay uh not me though I Do not shocked\nOr forward to that to forge compelling testimony last Thursday was method acting and method acting you think about something that will help you act a certain way Dr Ford thought about the event\n[noise]\nSan Diego\nRipple eight nine seven one S. H. G. E. D. triple eight nine seven one to four three Larry Elder released after dot com studio\nWhat is the actual number of illegal aliens in this country a new study put the number ... substantially higher than most people believe\nAnd next segment we're going to talk to California Republican candidate for governor John Cox new poll shows that the repeal of the gas tax the Republicans assume [noise] would be popular it measure to repeal it turns out the repeal is not popular majority of California you want to keep\nThe gas tax which increase the gas tax and also vehicle registration fees\nIn order to pay for infrastructure [noise] all that's coming up for like nine seven one S. A. G. E. and Kanye West went on Saturday Night live and when the show was over before the studio audience went on a\nRant about the welfare state house destabilized families and Ninety percent of the media is left wing [noise]\nI thought it was at a seat pac convention [noise] all that and more\nNow before the for Kavanaugh hearings where Ford made her accusations and Kevin responded sixty nine percent of Republicans supported Kavanaugh's\nNomination to the court thirty two percent of the general public support it now when Ford\nThe five but before Kevin I'll respond to listen to this panel headed up by Clinton apple is\nNo people are watching this all across the country has this began I got a text my friends saying she looks like every woman you know she says she and dean does uh she is someone\nThat is keep in mind this panel is before Kevin all testified but after four did\nCompletely recognizable to everybody in the country ah we we know women just like her and uh and she's certainly doesn't seem to the somebody was an agenda as she is putting herself in this very difficult position\nI it's a very odd hearing and uh the difference between the Democrats and Republicans has been very striking that her persona I think has come off as so far is highly credible\nI've examined hundreds of witnesses on the witness than she is extremely credible she is extremely detail oriented they're a little things about what she has said\nLike the fact that she has two front doors they can't make that stuff up it is so unusual that sort of detail it makes her testimony extremely credible and also that she said I Am terrified to be here I don't want to be here but I feel that this is\nMy civic duty I I found her to be one of the most credible witness is I think I've seen\nIt in Georgia have to say it is unmistakable\nHere how how clunky it is the transition between the Republicans on this committee to the Democrats you talked about Rachel Mitchell there who's been brought in by the Republicans so that they would not have to question Dr Christine Blasey Ford or a Brett capital when he appears 'em before\nUs here later today [noise] um but that transition back and forth has been um\nBumping if you will of what has not been bumpy\nAs sort of the temperature in tone in that room from the woman who was answering the questions Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nObviously up to the American people at home to make up their own minds about the veracity of what she's\nSaying what she has been very consistent George\nAgain that's an ABC panel led by George Clinton apple is after Dr Christine four testified but before Brett Kavanaugh did me well on CNN Simone Sanders said this about Kevin\nWhite I don't believe by cutting off on the entire to it and just the part that he noted about that year but ... but we call the young woman that ran that are ... because she was one of that\nShe didn't know that I just thought it wasn't believable I think he he he\nTold non filled by lied about things I don't think he needed to lie about that perhaps he thought that that he\nCould not get in the ground um because he didn't want to be found cup or anything I think the thing that I understand if you had been if you believe you have not done something wrong and you at that and you angry but the way he portrayed himself at the outset of the hearing today um he looked on hands\nOn hands so based upon that reaction based upon the reaction by the ABC panel one would think that even Republicans might have gotten wobbly on Brett Kavanaugh\nContrary known for I mentioned that before the Ford Kevin hearings sixty nine percent of Republicans supported his nomination to the Supreme Court\nAfter the for Kavanaugh hearing the figure rose to Seventy five percent meanwhile forty six percent of Republicans said they will be angry as opposed to be disappointed\nIf Kavanaugh is rejected\nNow as far as the public at large is concern before the for Kavanaugh hearings as I mentioned thirty two percent of voters favorite Kavanaugh's nomination now thirty seven thirty seven percent favorite now in thirty percent opposed it now thirty seven percent of post\nSo it's appeared to sour the general public on Kavanaugh but not on Republicans Republicans if anything the again Lindsey Graham has warned that if this is the new norm watch out for your nominees guys\nThe polygraph and they didn't tell us until September twenty six and deal with this what's in front of a guy who adamantly dies is\nEverybody who actually knows him in a real way say this is not the guy I Know I got Dr Ford\nWho can't tell me the time in the place and we'll see what happens to be something to do that now I'm going to go where I I don't know for some Republicans now so this was a Republican\nSalad [noise] if this becomes the new standards for you have an accusation for weeks you drop it right before the hearing\nYou withhold from the committee a chance\nTo do this in a a professional timely fashion me one day publically say\nTheir goal is to lay the get the Senate back in twenty eight teams to make sure he can't fill the seat they're publicly saying that I don't want to reward that kind of behavior I think we've been very fair and to my Republican colleagues\nIf you can ignore everything in this record looking at allegation is thirty five years old this uncertain time place\nDate and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans cost this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends\nIf this is the new norm [noise] you'd better watch out for you or nominates\nAnd Hawaii senator Renault said women should not only to listen to they should be believed to she told me to shut up and do the right thing for a change to that Lindsey Graham said this sort of grim\nThank you I Know I'm a a single white male from South Carolina and I told I should shut up but I Will not shut up if that's okay\nBecause I got here the same way everybody else did the faithful in South Carolina voted for me and centers got to be their voice men and women and I'm going to try to be their voice today\nAnd uh maybe not just for South Carolina but a little bit about what I think is going on here\n[noise]\nJoy bay her over at the view in mid season form\nDo not want to investigate this any further [noise]\nThey just want to hold onto that power they know that this country is getting darker why here are pans\nOn now sixty one percent compromise darker can I find that out I mean they want to stand on white Caucasian race car capital [noise] twenty forty five ... the forty nine percent so it's going down and so on I think that worry that all white people are gonna lose all their power so that they don't care if\nShe's lying muscles hotline why he's like they just want to hold onto that how how does sound will be like South Africa apartheid were ten percent of white people were running the country [noise] what\nHe's like they just want to hold onto that how how does sound a little day like South Africa apartheid were ten fat or white\nPeople were running the country it seems like that I tried to read that were on the trajectory was on like now we're going over and over and over again\nDid we not just a ... and re elect a black man for president\nAbilene, Texas the town\nWith a population over one hundred thousand that voted the most for President Trump eighty percent just elected a black guy for mayor\nHow'd that happen seven\nHundred counties voted for Obama in two thousand two thousand twelve two hundred of those seven hundred switch to try and two thousand six team did their racism just go in remission for eight years\n\nThe reason Trump got elected as because white people are afraid to countries becoming increasingly brown [noise]\nIsn't it [noise] racist [noise]\nI Am white so I Apologize [noise] become back California Republican candidate for governor John ... is the unpopular gas tax as unpopular as he thinks it is it only town\nUh this is not what the governor wants to happen but apparently if you weren't charter city and there are about a hundred and twenty starter cities in the state coming about two thirds of the population you have all these rights but you don't have as a general varsity\nAnd uh but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for San Francisco to do anything about this uh I mean you know they're\nThey're in the process of trying to get the state to approve a a legal injection sites where addicts can shoot up in a nice clean environment which\nI think it's it's certainly ridiculous and it's not going to solve the problem of the horrendous drug addiction that's afflicting California\nJohn Cox when are you going to debate your opponent next\nMonday at ten am on a public radio station he doesn't want to face me across a table on live television Larry I mean he's afraid that my good luck so\nJust going over well uh yeah\nBut really it's really actually a looked like such a youngster next to me a a which is good and I promise not to use his youth and inexperience against\nThem was\nJohn Cox speaking of of good looks he he is a a good looking guy or a

wife of his best friend who was his campaign manager who does that it can still survive\nA I don't know that's the broke called people tell me a lesson no Larry I've got so many issues that people in California you don't want the rest of the California looking like San Francisco does these days I mean you need a roadmap to avoid the fees on the sidewalk so\nI don't think Mr newsrooms answers for California or anywhere near what people want a they want lower taxes they want lower cost\nThis guy will just Jack up taxes Jack up the cost of government he won't do anything about the school he's basically a wholly owned subsidiary the teachers' unions and I I Want to take ... teachers like professionals that they are a Mr Newsom wants to keep them as a union members in a\nYou know we need to

going to talk to Barry claiming about the role that Mr Clinton not let's play because of the sanctimonious way he interviewed Sarah Sanders and Sarah Sanders had the grace not to bring up his behavior during the Clinton years\nLet's let him tell his side of the story before we allow allegations to determine hasn't higher\nFuture does seem that the president has already reached a judgment about their stories and there does seem to be a pattern here when Roy Moore is accused from Bill O'Reilly is accused when Roger ales is accused when Rob Porter is accused and that one's Kevin always accuse the president consistently every single time takes the side of the math you\nKnow it's interesting that you say that it's on a lot of Democrats that like to ignore Keith Ellison and Cory Booker they love to fight and champion women until they disagree with the how Frank and lost his job in the Senate\nAs I said Sara had too much class to mention Mr putting up the behavior back in Nineteen Ninety two plus revisit\nGovernor Clinton has a character problem but I take it the ... and has no Carolina when Colorado has its own well let me he is because not denied that he is engaged in Myrtle infidelity is not as as soon as he had problems and is that right and he uh he was talked about the draft into some people's character brother\nBill Clinton's passes character test throughout his life and throughout this campaign\nAnd he's still showing it turns to mystery of fights and what he's been doing this campaign is focused on the court and the American people on the jobs and the education that's what the American people care about they want to move into the future they don't want to be diverted by side issues they're not going to let the Republican attack machine diverse that was then and this is now\nAnd a number of other Democrats should have that same type of for the president is a question\nEvery single time the president is taking the side of the man against women user's\nTrip isn't that an amazingly annoying can we go back again Nineteen Ninety two George putting up all is what is named interest I can send your facts with names addresses phone numbers of an affair with this is from the documentary war room he's talking to a reporter who's calling him about an allegation that Bill Clinton had an affair\nIt wouldn't make a truce it is completely\nIf he went on the radio\nAnd said the bill Clinton is the father of eligible child he would be laughed at would think the crazy I guarantee you that if you do this in other words and that was obviously I\nKnow you're talking to a reporter and you're saying if you report this you'll never worked in democratic politics again what is a reporter doing working a democratic politics\nIs crazy I guarantee you that if you do this in other words that will probably see that\nSo you were threatening the people that do what you do right now isn't it ironic\n[noise] maybe don't want to another matter when you will be embarrassing for the national people will think one of my body will believe you\nThis is again George Clinton apple is Nineteen Ninety two threatening a reporter who had apparently a story on Bill Clinton was Governor Bill Clinton\nAnd people think is\nIs that the alternative is they don't do it cause any some temporary pain people who'd tomorrow I can a matter of fact and you have a campaign that understands within a difficult time\nWanted something right but I don't know\nAnd that was then this is now and in this case the president knows Brett Kavanaugh he's heard his story there hasn't been a shred of evidence to corroborate the other individual stories and there's been a lot of individuals that have come forward and talked about Brett Kavanaugh that they know a\nAnd they're confident that these things that have a final question what is the president fish All right\nJulie sweating it because the one who claims she observed Kevin are participating in a gang rape or being near a gang rape or she says she herself so she was victimized but can't say whether or not a Kevin I was one of those who assaulted her\nCan you tell me what happened what is your comfortable telling us\nWhat happened to me is probably the most horrendous awful thing that could happen to any human being my body was violated [noise]\nMy soul is broken or I Would not able to have somebody stop when I said no stop [noise]\nYou know I felt like somebody took me and basically said you're worthless there's\nNothing to us you are disposable I was at a party and I remember that I started not to feel very well and next thing I Know I was shoved into a room and I'm having my clothes torn from\nDifferent rock show um I was touched everywhere uh I was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assault on that it was horrible I had no way to fend them off\nYou know what I'm going to ask everyone is wondering if one of those people with Brett Kavanaugh [noise] I cannot\nSpecifically say that he was one of the one who assaulted me but before that happened to me at that party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there I saw mark judge there\nAnd they were hanging about the area where I started to feel disoriented and where the real life and where the other boys were hanging out and laughing I could share them laughing and laughing very\nHard for me to talk about that but it's important that somebody said something because if Brett Kavanaugh was one of those people that did this to me there is no way in the world that he should get scot free on this and that he should be on the Supreme Court he just I\nThink ... if he dies I there's no justice in the world\nShe said that she saw him standing by the door\nOr ... or the punch container is I don't know what he did but I saw him by them\nIn her declaration sweat Nick also wrote I also witnessed efforts by mark judge\nBrett Kavanaugh and others to cause and girls to become an ... an disoriented so they could then be gang raped in aside rumor bedroom by train as numerous boys I have a fair recollection of seen boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their turn with a girl inside the room\nThese boys included mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat did she say for you to say well it's so what happened and he happened to me I didn't put two and two together but I Would see boys standing outside of rooms\nCongregated together sort of like an outlet and I didn't know what was occurring out that I Would see them laughing a lot of laughing I'm forming in line outside or on the line but definitely huddled by Doris and I didn't understand what it could possibly be\nAnd and your declaration you described Brett Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge standing outside seen them stand outside the door yes with other voice senior suggesting that\nIn hindsight yeah things with Bob and its behavior\nI Would say that I I it's just too coincidental\nNow here's what NBC's Kate Snow said about the things that putting it fit on camera there were different from her written statement\nWhat we want to do here is lay out all that she said her story our reporting we want to be very transparent\nBecause these are very serious allegations Kavanaugh has\nCalled Julie sweating story nonsense and as far as the president today questioned her credibility and NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her claim there are things that she told us on camera\nThat differ from her written statement as we've been trying to independently to reach out to anyone who were members of pending parties with Julie sweating again Brett Kavanaugh and we've been asking her attorney for names so\nFar we've not found anyone who never that she's also unclear about when she first decided\nOh hey well as just Tuesday we still have a whole week we come back Mary claiming what role did George putting up us play in the lining the shooters of Bill Clinton and how very effective only is right now I'm going to leave town\nAll\nWas caught by the judge or not telling the truth at that time Sam Donaldson who with his co host\nOn ABC's This week called me up and he asked me about the monopoly is whether he had been found to have lived and I said fame how could you leave this guy here in the air when he's now a certified liar and of course now you know he's a multi millionaire and he's riding high ABC\nAnd now he feels a duty bound to take a shot at the president simply because he defended judge Kavanaugh\nLarry claiming a you said you had a Stephanopoulos under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim it's done\nWell I had a very good memory [laughter] you know the favorite\nPhrase of the Clinton people was I have no specific regular recollection means I remember something I just can't remember now on the front of the ... justice so no he wouldn't have the right thing and like I said he he was found to light on the love\nWell given the fact that he won't admit to anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nThat's been widely reported him in Reno because actually ... you wrote a book called the war room which became a documentary where in that book he admitted to working recovery return to address false allegations by your accusers\nBy Bill Clinton's accuses the women that I represented ironically wary if today's world with some of these ... judges erotic patrol denying an allegation is enough to say that you think someone in fact the credit has got to lawsuits right now because he denied that\nHe sexually harassed and the women these ... allowed to go for her forward in time for change and we now are and what can affect the civil war between left and right and these judges are furthering the civil war\nLarry claimant is the founder judicial watch and freedom watch Larry I was having a conversation the other day with a buddy of mine is about my age and he said he told a friend of yours about\nGeorge Stephanopoulos role in the mining these women she ... the the friend is also a middle aged unaware that Stephanopoulos even worked for Bill Clinton let alone that he was involved in orchestrating these strategy that was later on called the nuts are slept strategy unaware of it so if this guy's a middle aged guys unaware but imagine with people in their forties thirties twenties\nThink of George Stephanopoulos they have no idea he was involved no connection whatsoever\nNo they don't and I might add Jennifer Flowers actually brought a lawsuit against Stephanopoulos along with Hillary Clinton and James Carville was in the district or their data\nOr many years ago twenty ... twenty five years later he was over our river allegations see a doctor to tape which she didn't\nBill Clinton with her admitting to an affair and that got a lot of news for ...\n... is it true do you speak French

know he didn't if he's lying about anything in this context short of his actions toward the women who are making the accusations\nDo you think that that is not disqualifying record\nWell look I first off\nI don't know how you're going to prove that he's caught lying about something I mean this this is what he's he said that he drank he said that he drank to access that time said he was drunk at times he admitted to that the only thing he did not admit to his was blacking out and not recalling things and he has you know he has his his college roommate\nBasically you know saying you know I live with this guy for three years and I never saw him in this position where the next day he was\n... ... ... ... ah did also said that he never saw him blackout I don't know that the blackout standard is the sole criteria and I know you're\nYou're saying that he got drunk I might I\nDidn't really admitted any more than he needed to I Do think it's fair criticism to say that he\nWas not talking about himself the way his classmates talk about um the question is does it matter\nAnd I get I I don't think I I don't see where ... is it does he have to go out and say oh yeah I got I got ... no I mean\nIt's so dry I feel like if you watch ... interview wait I call that when it happened as a mistake and not because it was with Fox folk it's because he's got across from a friendly face
