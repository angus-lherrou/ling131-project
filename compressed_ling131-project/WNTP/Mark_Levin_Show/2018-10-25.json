I talked with him cause some earlier today she was one of the first people to start using this term again several years ago trying to revive it because\nOf the actual meaning it had been given a negative connotation by some who are looking and you know what are we talking about political correctness in this uh open to the to the show there in the open to the our you know this uh this is the following his rabid peace keeper politically correct\nIt'd be Olympic politically correct that about me when I Do this thing is that my politics are correct my politics are right that the political correctness that I'm about as far as being not offensive I don't care\nI'm not about not offending people and neither is for him 'cause San now he's a fellow at the middle east forum the gates donating Institute and the Lincoln fellow Claremont Institute he was a former senior advisor to brags that leader Nigel for Raj\nAnd he knows about nationalism he knows that it means taking care of yourself and your nation first not about racial politics not about identity politics it's about the nation versus global is\nNationalism versus globalism\nIt's exactly what President Trump was talking about it was not a ambiguous it was very very clear so I wanted to talk to Rahim ... about what nationalism really mean since they have that experience there and as I said\nHe's one of the first people to kind of revive the term as the president said when he said you're not supposed to say it anymore and it's ridiculous to say to not be able to say I believe in my nation first this this is part of that conversation for him ...\nThank you for having me I have to have to say I wasn't one of the first as a given that given that nationalism goes back hundreds of years\nBut certainly may live in in a multi ... we we reintroduce the political lexicon by a across the across the ocean I'm here in the United states\nI think that's that's a that's a great point a great distinction in and let's let's talk about that as as the president declared a correctly when he when he tried to draw the contrast between globalism thinking more about the world's up a names rather than the needs of the nation that you are elected to represent the president said that very directly\nOr that he means national it's been that I'm going to put my people first we'll worry about the concerns of less than the rest of the globe second\nUm he said that national M Ms ... nationalism is kind of become a word that you don't use anymore and I think we should use it again\nWhat does he mean and why he's right of course because you saw the instant reaction right hand but why did a tour nationalism which when compared to globalism is a pretty benign term as far as I'm concerned that says more concerned about our people before the world's people\nBut he because there was actually a big role to generous are about ... I mean globalism you if you think about what had done\nOver the past Fifteen or Twenty years actually it hasn't really considered itself with the rest of the world it's considered itself with a a political or cultural and media release\nA around the world whether it's in Beijing London or New York city of Los Angeles you know ... years really served to shed be addressed um of the very very very few\nUh I'm not married are very few have been you know exploiting workers at Foxconn factories are exposing jobs from Racine, Wisconsin\nAnd so we'll see the reason you get a Trump Shay out why leave it at ... ... ... people up with all the media Iraq with specially\nUp because we know now for several years and I think people who have studied it live by the way of seeing\nOver the course of his life especially when he talks about trade deals and that sort of thing that he's had these nationalistic tell me is that he's there actually come out and said it and ... and ... and ... June by saying it\nIs is crazy gets another dividing line he's very good at doing that is\nA dividing line that he knows that the that sort of the leading to the machine the Democrats the media all of those guys that they have to attack that line they have to attack that far like and that's how it is very very hard to argue and gets mad why wouldn't you be he's indefensible even at the age of Seventy whatever he is\nUm and they do have the lecture logging and so they call them fight the idea of nationalism to fight in the idea\nThat the nation states shoot to be the final arbiter should be celebrated is almost impossible especially amongst Americans I mean you'll you'll you'll revolution was nationalist revolution\nHamilton Hamilton's ... on the subject of ... was a national issue document um you know Teddy Roosevelt said about how to one ... one of them one language\nAnd say goodbye to the immigrants who will be to simulate is nationalism and they don't have arguments against that so that ... they're angry they're upset but he's a ... from ... and that's the that's what we've seen play out last routes\nI think that's well said the only argument they do have against that is to just say just scream racism which of course is the you know the easiest argument to make a ... is our guest is a fellow with the middle east forum the gates don't Institute and the Lincoln fellow at the\nEr Claremont Institute you know the president said when he pulled out of the Paris climate accord he said look\nI care more about and I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of Paris and another event he said in his first year in the presidency I was elected president of the United states not president of the world how can any elected official whether he'd be president a member of our Congress or anywhere else\nSuggest otherwise your job is to represent the people that shows you not to represent the interests of outside nations especially if it comes at the expense of those who chose to lead them\nYou know that's that's a really great point and and there's actually been touched the book is just come out on this subject it's it's clearly the virtue of nationalism by a professor older your I'm ...\nAnd and he he sort of explains his childhood and and it it sort of awful and by awful I mean the rest of the world's all you know I could be an advocate of a ... and I'm staring at math have a a an empire the one hand right now\nYou know it it sort of ... we done historically imperialistic Lee ... is looked to one leader you know whether it's the king of England\nOr the Holy Roman empire you know the world is used to having ... ... ... words to one person where they already well\nOr or several people wherever they are in the world and the world is currently doing that just stare at the time the last few decades with the president of the United states you don't always refer to build\nA ... in that in the in that office is referred to as the world leader the most powerful man in the world you know all of that sort of thing\nAnd and it's it's it's refreshing or ... not just I think for Americans which holiday to you know point trillion dollars being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan which was that it should be no money for public schools and it's a right\nUm I think it's refreshing for them but it's also refreshing should be refreshing but the rest of the world\nUm where nations like Italy and nation is like the United states ... nations like India stray or an an ... a a three independent sovereign nations\nActually don't have to act as protectorate channel they actually do have to act that independent sovereign nations and this was another thing that President Trump stress really talks about nature he says look I'm not looking\nFor so for protectorate started looking ... allies and and so this is a major reset what's going on now\nI'm ... and it pains me to say but when you talk about national there yet says there was a period in history where nationalism uh ethnic nationalism specifically but very I'd be very quickly and spiraled out of control but it pains me\nBut people do know that nationalism actually goes back hundreds and hundreds of years and still looked like so many countries most countries I Would say around the world but for whatever reason\nLess media they didn't want to applaud United States\nAnd and of course the key there is ethnic nationalism is not what President Trump is talking about that's what they want to make it about that is what the left wants to make it about he's talking about nationalism versus globalism simple patriotism\nNot for you know foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that's your responsibility because it is about us versus nation first\nThat certain nationals I mean it is not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language it is simply a statement of I pledge elaborate said this before I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America anybody who's ever recited that pledge is saying\nThis is where my allegiance laws don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or Mexico or to France or Germany or to\nUh to um uh Switzerland or to up to the Dominican Republic or to a Guatemala or anywhere else I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd that means I'm a national ...\nThere is no coat in it there's no racism and that there is no bigotry and it and we need to stop this nonsense right now stopped

to call ... states and for a minute because I really got from what I Want to say about this here now listen okay we're going after the first thing I thought what I heard about these so called spoke to devise and these are all these Democrats\nWe play a little bit of the stuff and he wrote conversation that I had already play and let the thing for the shot and then once you're reactions eight eight eight nine seven months age eight eight eight nine seven one seven to for three\nGive us all is that the president Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston\nVery clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism\nNot comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the globe burst in our country second a national is think about our country first in the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear\nThat this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree given the president's history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history\nI prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go internal election or he is capitalizing on ... so we're going to agree to deliberate\nSaying well yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not caused it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not getting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many president has said over the years and it's why it makes someone like me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes you feel so uncomfortable as a matter of you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you or your you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway you know so given all of your economic history the president has largely talking about global or ah nationalism and globalism\nIn were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're gonna stop other countries in taking advantage of the United states if I have to use terrorists if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better deal out of the market is that right now is now I can I make national this but is that not economic\nNationalism is like last night as you look at the way the president assessing south that gives you the truth sits at an impasse he would engage and things like GTC to point out and partner with our allies that have been kept saying [noise]\nDefinitely rural thank you for coming on your first year that she is on Sunday that live at the top of\nThat music can be on there of course was the end of the issue at top of a interview that I did with ah Seventy role this morning so that was a replay of this morning's conversation that I had there and I'm waiting for that than um but when I Want to get to and I want you to respond to is this an eight eight eight nine seven on stage\nUm she said she's not putting words in the president's mouth\nBut she is doing exactly that she is saying that the president is talking about white nationalism the president said globalism nationalism global just put the world first in our country second nationalist put our country first and the rest of the world's second I'm a nationalist she and Jim Acosta are saying\nThis rather than just to follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white national I've never\nI mean that's if that's not putting words into somebody's mouth for the purpose of trying to tear them down\nThen nothing is he literally said why did you skip the word white don't you mean white nationalist he stuck to stuff that weren't in his mouth I asked a rule about it and she said no we're not putting words in his mouth that's just what he meant because he's been dog whistling and using coded language from the very beginning\nFor goodness sakes the president of the United states has set on numerous occasions I was not elected president of the world I was elected president of the United states it's my job to serve the people who elected me they are first\nI Want to give one great example that I cannot take credit for\nOne great example I think this is just the perfect analogy alright\nOn Twitter this morning when I brought this up and I had the conversation with Stephanie rule

before the election Kurt I Do not buy it for one second I smell false flags being planted go ahead\nI think it is more likely than not not a right wing conservative outlier viewing this look a it is one of three things at the right wing conservative outlier is a nut who was a political and just wacky\nOr it is a someone uh allied with a lap attempting to do exactly what's happening now which is a conservative suburb violent Bob guys [noise] um\nIf you look at the evidence that we are constantly told how a random shooters are going to turn out to be you know and are a Christian you know what can I may never are never we know that a Democrats have been urging violence and a ... attack ... we know\nThat the law has a history of bombings just look at the Nineteen sixties and seventies indisputable\nOr that they did it all it's also indisputable that we did see a nearly endless series of hoaxes mostly hate crime hoaxes on campus as an adult where someone did something horrible ideas swastika or news or something and\nIt turned out to be the very same a social justice for victims are trying to create a pressure\nI don't know the answer you don't know the answer but I Will tell you this I Am not going to allow the meat\nTo tell me that I Can't look at the facts and fake this is a viable possibility I were to blame Donald Trump and sixty three decent Americans who are built this country feed it you'll end up ...\nA a face on the the the the the\nSketchy narrative I think what we call it will lead to\nCurb the president came out yes or to today rather and did what a president should do so did the vice president and by the way and they called\nFor an end to this they called for civility that called for a no more violence he said very clearly quote in these times we have to unify we have to come together in some one very clear strong unmistakable message\nThat acts or threats of political up any time\nHave no place in the United states of America\nWhat I was absolutely true that was of course it's true but but but hold on ... this is what I Want you to really react to\nThe response to that from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority minority leader Nancy Pelosi was to rip President Trump suggesting that he didn't mean it saying quote from President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence they well this in a statement hurts\nThe party that actually has Maxine Waters and Cory Booker and Hillary Clinton and countless others out they're calling for acts of violence and instability in the public forum they're the ones saying that it's Trump and the Republicans who are responsible for violence thought\nOh look they are bought that they are blind and stupid because they ... out and got have always someone wrote a book called militant normal develop on Amazon about this very subject they think we're stupid\nMay think we're stupid because Democrats are used to dealing with stupid people that is for rank and file Democrats [noise]\nIt's not going to work this is going to have the same effect as they thought Kevin always a great idea let's track this guy and a drink beer and you know had fun in high school which track them and the ... that destroyed their blew away\nHis is another example of a situation that they laid it like sensible adults could only benefit them politically but they will not do it they will apply to bigotry and prejudices against normal Americans and\nTry and paid ... marriage as some sort of a set of violence psychopaths\nAnd normal Americans are going to say that's just not true you know whoever did this clearly needs to be idea whether it's a right wing outlier a yacht or maybe you need to go that not house or a leftist trying to disrupt that um\nThere is not a single conservative out there who condones this violence there is not one\nUp here I heard that that that's that's a big part of this because\nThe the moment even when Nancy Pelosi God's shouted down by a bunch of people calling her communist just a few days ago kind of echoing and Mary ... there's been done to Ted Cruz and and and Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and as a Sarah

joining us we got one hour to go seven minutes after the top very much looking forward to more of your thoughts on the phone lines are jammed with people wanting to talk about nationalism and\nThey want to talk about pipe bombs and fingers of bland they want to talk about caravans of people invading our country by way of our southern border I had a conversation I wanted to share part of with you\nWith a regime custom\nI talked with regime customer earlier today he was one of the first people to start using this term again several years ago trying to revive it because of its actual meaning it had been given a negative connotation by some\nWho are looking and you know what are we talking about political correctness in this uh open to the to the show there and they open up the hour you know this uh this is the following his rabid peace keeper politically correct\nThe Olympic politically correct about me when I Do this thing is that my politics are correct my politics are right that's the political correctness that I'm about as far as being not offensive I don't care\nI'm not about not offending people and neither is ... now he's a fellow at the middle east forum the gates donating Institute and the Lincoln fellow at the Claremont Institute he was a former senior advisor to brags that leader natural for Raj\nAnd he knows about nationalism he knows that it means taking care of yourself and your nation first not about racial politics not about identity politics it's about the nation versus global lists\nNationalism versus globalism\nIt's exactly what President Trump was talking about it was not a ambiguous it was very very clear so I wanted to talk to Rahim ... about what nationalism early mean since they have that experience there and as I said he's one of the first people to kind of revive the term\nAs the president said when he said you're not supposed to say that any more and it's ridiculous to say to not be able to say I believe in my nation first there was this is part of that conversation for him ...\nThank you for having me I have to have to say I wasn't one of the first ad but if you're good that given that nationalism goes back hundreds of years but\nCertainly may live in in a multi ... we were reintroduced apolitical lexical ... across The Cosby Asian I'm here in the United states\nI think that's that's a that's a great point a great distinction in\nAnd let's let's talk about that as as the president declared a correctly when he when he tried to draw the contrast between globalism thinking more about the world's a needs rather than the needs of the nation that you are elected to represent the president said that very directly\nAh that he means nationalist in that I'm going to put my people first we're worried about the concerns are less than the rest of the globe second\nUm he said that national M Ms ... nationalism is kind of become a word that you don't use anymore and I think we should use it again\nWhat does he mean and why he's right of course because you saw the instant reaction right hand but why did a tour nationalism which when compared to globalism is a pretty benign term as far as I'm concerned that says we're concerned about our people before the world's be\nWell because there was actually a big role to generous about ... and he I mean ... can you if you think about what a dog\nUm over the last Fifteen Twenty years actually it hasn't really considered it so we can listen to the world that self with a political and cultural and meteor leech\nA around the world whether it's in Beijing London dull you will says the Los Angeles you know you really have to shed be addressed um all the very very very\nUh I'm not married a very few have been exploited workers the folks on factories\n... ... jobs from Racine, Wisconsin and so because they don't see the results get\nDrunk setting out ... to ... ... people up and throw the media Iraq with speciality\nBecause we know now for several years and I think people the study is life by the way have seen over the course of his life especially when he talks about trade deals and that sort of thing that he's had these nationalistic twenty eight days but he's there actually come out and said it and and he and he's doing by saying it\nIs is crazy gets another dividing large is very good at doing that is a dividing line that he knows that the the ... the city too mushy the Democrats the media one of those guys\nThat they have to attack that lie they have to attack that product and they told me that this would be very hard it gets mad and why wouldn't you be is indefensible even at the age of Seventeen or whatever it is um and they do have the intellectual argument so they call them fight the idea of nationalism there to fight and the idea\nThat the nation state should be the final arbiter shoot it'd be so Britain is almost impossible especially amongst Americans I mean you'll you'll you'll revolution was a nationalist revolution\nHamilton handles who's the on the subject matter of ... was a national issue dumped him at\nUm you know what Teddy Roosevelt said about how does one ... one of them one language and say goodbye to the immigrants who wouldn't assimilate each nationalism and they don't have arguments against that so that's why they're angry they're upset that he's been yet another from forming and after you that's what we've seen play out last three routes\nI think that's well said the only argument they do have against that is to just say just scream racism which of course as the you know the easiest argument to make a ... is our guest is a fellow at the middle east forum the gates don't Institute in Lincoln fellow at the\nUh Claremont Institute you know the president said when he pulled out of the Paris climate accord he said look I care more about and I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not that people have Paris and another event he said er interspersed during the presidency I was elected president of the United states not president of the world\nHow can any elected official whether it'd be president a member of our Congress or anywhere else suggest otherwise your job is to represent the people that chose not to represent the interests of outside nations especially\nIf it comes at the expense of those who chose to lead them\n[noise] you know that's that's a really great point and and there's actually been touched the book is just come out on this subject if it's called the virtue of nationalism\nBy a professor older your I'm ...\nAnd and he he sort of explains the outlook and it should have also in ... I mean the rest of the world's all you know it could be an advocate of a ... and I'm ... I'm not going to have\nA a an empire that we once had right now you know it it it sort of ... when John historically imperialistic in blue ... is looked to one leader you know whether it's the king of England\nOr the Holy Roman emperor or you know the world is used to have a story ... ... words to one person where they already they will\nAll several people where they already but will and the world is currently doing that occurs hysterically done the last few decades with the president of the United states you know I always refer to build\nA road or is it not in the in that office is referred to as the world leader the most powerful man in the world you know all of that sort of thing\nAnd and it's it's it's a new fresh in your set not just I think for Americans which holiday to you know Floyd trillion dollars being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan which was that it should be no money for public schools and it's a right\nUm I think it's refreshing for them but it's also refreshing should be refreshing but the rest of the world\nWhere nations like Italy and nations like ... and ... like India of Australia and an ... a a three independent sovereign nations actually don't have to act just protectorate changeable they actually do have to act that independent sovereign nations and this was another thing the\nPresident Trump's strength is really talks about ... so he says look I'm not kidding fair so flip protectorate started looking ... allies and\nAnd so this is a major reset what's going on now I'm ... and it it seems to me to say that ... nationally there yet says ... there was a period in history where nationalism\nUh ethnic nationalism specifically but very I'd be very quickly and spiraled out of control but it pains me but people do know that nationalism right she goes back hundreds and hundreds of years and still applies to many countries most countries I Would say around the world but for whatever reason\nLess media that he wanted to have large United States\nAnd and of course the key there is ethnic nationalism is not what President Trump is talking about that's what they want to make it about that is what the left wants to make it about he's talking about nationalism versus globalism simple patriotism\nAnd that is a very very big difference thanks again to receive a or where he was a song for joining us thanks for joining us we'll take a quiet time out five for instance for Larry Elder understand when\nKnow foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that's your responsibility because it is about us versus nation first national\nNationals I mean it is not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language it is simply a statement of I pledge ill that's why I said this before I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America anybody who's ever we sided that pledge is saying\nThis is where my allegiance laws don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or Mexico or to France or Germany or to uh to um\nUh Switzerland or to uh to the Dominican Republic or to a Guatemala or anywhere else I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd that means I'm a national ... there's no coat in it there's no racism and if there is no bigotry in it and we need to stop this nonsense right now stopped letting the Democrats defined language to us Diane is calling us next from Greenville South Carolina Thank you for joining us now and go right ahead\nHey how are you wonderful day for a couple of things as a as a trio patriot and a non ... apple up things first thing is that last spring getting what happened it out and say look at look at people\nTrump is drawing tens of\nOf people um the Trump ... the ...\n[noise]

country that is a precedent that you hate why would that\nNot only are they carrying though the Honduran flag on this um march ... word not only are they carrying a they are chanting\nAgainst the president Donald Trump they're chanting negative things like empty for does in American streets about Donald Trump and yet they're going to come to the door and said Donald Trump let us in lettuce end of the nation that we don't like lettuce end of the nation are you as that you're the president of somebody we don't like\nBecause it's still better than where we came from I I had been asking the same question but Diane since this whole thing began\nHow can they expect us to want to welcome them in when they're not waving the American flag saying we love you and we want to be like you wouldn't be part of you know waving the Honduran flag saying we want to invade you and bring Honduras to you and that is correct that is something that I Will never abide by\nAnd large state of war re we

you know lifting\nOkay we're going after the first thing\nI thought what I heard about these so called um spoke to devise and these are all these Democrats a whale oil anyway let's figure out how to live and everything they have been accusing Trump of doing this I'm going back to the Democrats have been doing [noise] I Do believe that they find anything\nAnd um it didn't work out so well for the candidates are who by the way we're and by historians confirmed this is not only the biblical account they were child sacrifices they practiced human sacrifice they burn babies alive or so not such\nA level folks\nAnd by the way you want to have ancient Canaan nights welcomed with open arms into the United states or you were a six sorry son of a B and you need help Seinfeld and San Francisco well thank you for helping me with this segment we talked about this earlier in the show\nA look I think it is perfectly appropriate for people to have personal compassion for some of the people\nWho are in that caravan and no I don't think they're all terrorists and I don't think they all mean or evil for the United states\nBut if you simply cannot say that the country is going to be wide open to a every single human being in the world who is hungry are starving or facing violence are facing a difficult situation it's billions of people\nAnd that is not fair to the people who have lived here who themselves or their families have contributed to the United states\nI look what what is has to happen with the caravan particularly\nThis is a test and if the Democrats\nReally want us to say oh come on and you six thousand or seven thousand or however many they are\nThen what do you say to the next caravan was already starting in Guatemala\nThe truth of the matter is I Do believe President Trump is wrong to say well we should canceled foreign aid to El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala what we should do is say look let's work together on this and we will provide more of that foreign aid to keep the people there\nAnd for the people who are going to be sent back from the caravan you don't have to say well you're going to be sent back to a hopeless situation send them back with some private organizations of some Christian organization some do good organizations that will help them get set up so they don't have to live under said squalid conditions\nAre back in Honduras or back in Guatemala with the other caravan but the the answer and I haven't heard a single Democrats\nSay this but that's the implication if everyone who is needy and helpless\nAnd a destitute and desperate has an open door and the United states\nWhat does that mean to our population\nAnd what does that mean for the people who are here already\nBut when from Los Angeles wrote in er during the disagreements segment last week you mentioned how the rights is not generally harassed groups of politicians as the left is prone to do\nI remember the Tea Party people disrupting rallies and far right groups in Charlottesville et cetera okay the Tea Party people were not disrupting rallies what she's talking about is they came to town meetings\nA constituent meetings that were held by congressman to try to get their attention and the left as this too that it seems to me is not is not hateful when people come and you have a constituent meeting with a member of Congress\nWhat I'm Talking about is the I the effort to shut down people and not allow them to speak this on college campuses is uniquely the left\nWhen it comes to interrupting congressional hearings uh when it comes to and you might say well what about these bombs we don't know about the bombs right now we don't but it's it's so laments a bowl and that that same thing by the way is true Charlottesville Charlottesville wasn't conservatives\nAnd these people these creeps that's one of the good things in the ... movie\nAnd yes it has some good things in it some things that are I have more problems with one of the things that I thought was very good in the movie\nAn interview with Richard Spencer who is this leading neo Nazi was very much part of that Charlottesville seen any a leftist he's not on the right\nOkay and then there's a another email that came in about where left and right stand right now and where they're going saying that no Republicans haven't moved to the right up plus a a tweet that says Michael you're wrong President Trump is a hundred percent responsible\nFor where rage takes us in the United states we will get to that and more on disagreement that on the Michael ...\nMichael ...

Republicans means what anybody needs to have a majority in the house both for thirty five so to aging in one more than half is what you got to have\nI think when we're done we are going to have about two hundred and twenty three two hundred twenty four Republicans about four or five a margin of that that's enough to keep fancy below sea or some other Democrat from becoming speaker and I believe this because there was a red meat shed\nA red beach had that we've established post Kavanaugh post caravan\nA red ... stop and the blue wave right so what do you think of that\nAs an eight eight nine seven one said let me tell you about some friends of ours\nFriends aware he's we love these folks that were doing to really really good things for the alliance defending freedom we talk about various uh\nDangers various risks you know you have to bomb devices going on political leaders there are clear and present danger is all over here's a clear and present danger our religious freedom under

certainly have certainly have openings um I'm a fan of simplicity and I appreciate the creativity but I'm a fan of simplicity it's called we have borders you have a country our borders going to work

way your immigration has ever worked it's not the way immigration should work a James in California pay ... percent but Larry how are you doing\nI'm doing incredibly well what's up I'm\nOut here in California we haven't had a whole lot of Republican representation true on the ballot this year we've got two Democrats running for the Senate we don't have any Republicans on the ballot\nSo I Am from my hat on the ring I established your friends on Facebook I started things out and work at work on a write in campaign to see if we can get into the U.S Senate\nUm or who are you seeking to unseat\nDianne Feinstein\nYeah well that was you wouldn't be the one who's up as in ...\n... ah what what you\nNeed to be out yeah\nUh what made the usual method not workable [noise]\nI mean where you where you like to go through the primaries and you know the time it's at her I Am absolutely that is\nAbsolutely that is workable normally I Would not um considering running for senator however when

about\nThat that's that's ... that's not possible or true\nSo I I and and honestly I mean if if it seems like a nice project and stuff you want to knock stuff out and do I buy a big fan of that and this crazy day and age who knows but uh\nI I think generally speaking if or even in in crazy California\nIf you want to have even a ghost of a chance I got to fight a lot of people to give you a lot of money and actually get in there into the arena and actually play for real otherwise it's kind of vanity project but hey or or just a or a Facebook ranch or whatever all of which is great I express ourselves is fantastic\nSo I I Wish you well I Wish you truly do 'em as matter of fact in an interesting story here but uh and saying you know Dianne Feinstein up on a bill and then only debate debate

Ninety three zero nine two seven or ask for people tell me what stinks\nUsed to I Am and\nWhat I Know you've done [noise]\n\nCan't\nTo the Larry Elder show oh California\nOh California where\nThat top two primary system and are you all crazy yeah it's kinda funny as soon as I finish trying this guy you know that's a that's earth logic for everything boils down to a a\nCalifornia US Senate race there showing the weird effects of uh of these phenomena Kevin deadly owners ... democratic corps but he's the one that got the endorsement of the state Democratic Party\nDianne Feinstein didn't get it passed the rest of America get all and and pardon me everybody in California you call in show appreciate that that is the top two primary system than that has denied Republicans a general election candidate a him is a contest you talk to people there you go\n[noise] tries that's crazy [noise]\nBut anyway it can affect that have you on to a\nDianne Feinstein is going to actually smoke Kevin delay our um it it it'd be it'd be here's here's here's logic you're ready and and you can apply this to Republicans you can apply to Democrats\nAnd uh and and the here's the deal here is the deal\nYou have to have a burning desire to fire the income but if you're trying to beat an incumbent and the only way you're gonna do it you can be pretty popular person pretty good candidate cetera et cetera is there's got to be a burning desire to fire the incumbent\nAnd I I mean among the among actual voters I Know they're they're California Republicans who are dying to get rid of Dianne Feinstein guess what you're not in the majority Dianne Feinstein is going to win and it's not going to be close [noise]\n\nFilling in for the\n\nAsks what I'm Talking about our number two to show my parents were sick today after a long distance running around for you yes Sam's from fragile right [noise] graduate closely as\nDislikes but the reason for that is it's being John Anderson's birthday John Anderson is Seventy four leaf vocalist on obviously\nThere is a roundabout and the stuff you've actually hurting and the magnificent four sides of tales from topic graphic oceans there is a mind trip or if you've ever in the mood for it [noise] and it's funny because if John Anderson Lee vocalist of yeses Seventy four he's only two years younger than McCartney\nAnd he was a Beagle and the Beatles very much a sixty is a\nPhenomenon yes very much a seventies phenomena but you know what you know one now and there are coddling together to the building blocks of yes Nineteen sixty eight [noise] so I mean the Beatles only been around for like four or five years and and and you asked his crushed starting to crank out a progressive rock and\nPalate mostly people's heads explode there in Britain a late the late sixties anyway yes quite quite the record library there already a telephone number is eight eight eight nine seven one said eight eight eight nine seven one said mark\nDavis in Fort Larry Elder let me hit the reset ha tell you where exactly we are and what are my thoughts on some things and then the idea is that you share your thoughts\nAbout some things and we hope that uh that you will do so eight eight eight nine seven to one said eight eight eight nine seven one said real quick as we begin or would you be the first on the movie everybody's talking about before the elections depths of the nation national issues is masterpiece is on DVD at about five days\nOctober thirtieth release dates or your copy today at destination movie dot com death of a nation movie ... so you know it's compelling so go get that destination movie dot com okay the mystery packages\nThe story seconds the finger pointing continues and let's make a list or we don't know and what we know this is how you stay sane throughout this entire thing right now my list of what we don't know\nAnd what we know may differ from yours you may think you know some things that I don't you may think some things that I think I Know are in dispute and that's why we have telephone lines and so um to join us\nHere's what we do not know we don't know who's on these packages that can be started the most basic we have no idea who said these packages or why [noise]\nI and that's where you stub your toe for the first time it's like wait a minute don't we know that this was some expression of hate for for liberal uh iconic figures clearly sent by some nut bag on on the right [laughter] so we don't know any such thing\nYou know is that probably the greatest possibility yeah because we have are not bags to\nKnow the left as guys who shoot up baseball fields and and the left has tons of people who uh will shock you out at a restaurant and claw like zombies the doors of the Supreme Court and do all kinds of other ... wheels off nonsensical thing we've um we've we've got our crazy too\nBut you know the thing that that started to wrap itself around me when the story first began in the end to end the tally of mysterious packages started to grow I said you know\nDoesn't tend to be something we do\nAnd ... and I and why in the world what are they exactly being that's earth logic why would you do it sometimes you send somebody a pipe bomb 'cause you want to kill up but you know ... nothing exploded yet you know what I mean\nAnd I think that it was the one and sources mailbox where the where the the white powder was nothing it was an art now and then by the way that doesn't make it okay if you send somebody something just to scare the or the ... out of them that that's a terrorist act as well\nSo you don't have to blow up for you to have done something very very illegal\nBut is it okay for you if you keep that uh that hoax antenna primed and dialed in you bet it's okay mine is\nDoes that mean I'm declaring it hopes I'm telling you I Know it's a hoax I noticed the left doing this to the left so that we can you know spread out and have some myth of equivalency like yeah we're changing image we got a lot of restaurants were chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants we got Maxine Waters advocating\nHooliganism but you have your crazies too you're trying to kill the Clintons when the Obamas and Joe Biden and Robert De Niro you people are just like\nUs yet no we're not okay because even if even if we do find that this was one conservative lunatic you know what that is one conservative lunatic we have more\nTo be sure but um it it's not our rank and file really hopped up activists who are out doing things that countless thousands of leftist are doing\nAll the time there is no comparison so the thing that we don't know is who did this and why we do not know it [noise]\nHere's what we do know a media culture that hates Trump's God's will do anything to tag him with this bad story\nAnd that is why you actually get I mean I I heard Wolf Blitzer I was kind of funny I was getting out of the car dollar into serious actually I'm In a car [noise] Wolf Blitzer talking to some congressman or something so we know we have CNN just if you ever have the president's here tell them that we we really tried to get things right we're not involved in\nFake news like will shut up dude it's pathetic it's sad I mean they've got a great idea of you and Don Lemon you know want to go you know build a tree house in the backyard never a club meeting why don't you decided to start covering things fairly covering things honestly lose the corruption fired Jim Acosta get your act together\nYou know lose the Trump drain joins syndrome and become a real news organization because the the cries of fake news are real and deserved and valid an\nAccurate and I'll just try a ball around this and then I'm going to your calls eight eight eight nine seven on stage eight eight eight nine seven ... as the question hangs from the rafters\nShould the president dial back his rhetoric in view of the there's this package story or blah blah blah blah blah\nShort answer is no\nThere is nothing nothing in President Trump's rhetoric that somehow necessarily leads to somebody doing something like that even if it is a nut job conservative there is zero connection to be made there none by thinking people\nBut by people who've had a bug up there but about Trump since the day he won there's plenty of material and they're going to use it and they're going to hammer it and they're going to bludgeon it and you know what it's gonna backfire to\nJust like Kavanaugh just like the caravan desk is going to backfire too you don't think voters are paying attention today say wait a minute what now their first we have ...\nMedia apologist planted an embedded with the caravan trying to uh\nUh characterize it as as something noble pursuit\nAnd we have what the media and Senate Democrats did in the cabinet debacle and now they're taking this very admittedly unfortunate and scary story of devices showing up at a at some Democrat mailboxes\nAnd they tried to blame Trump for it are you kidding me this will make people crawl on broken glass to vote Republican\nSo please keep it up guys please keep it up [noise] we're in San Diego hey Sean Mark Davis into Larry how are you doing\n... good ... all good thank you I Want to call in and and respond to a couple of things if I could take just a moment to your child on but I thought you had a caller calling talking about he had two\nFormer Mexican military and he would take right very I mean our goals dry America read that propaganda running and not only that probably\nGoing to notice that propaganda it's an anecdote it's an anecdotal stories from a caller and I take it at at face value with a little bit of a grain of salt\nI I mean yeah but that that type of thing and spread out your your your list\nOkay time very here on the guy said the Mexican they're going to be the diet\nSo he's a he said I don't want to make up stuff to say he he he he told a story about a couple of guys that he had conversations with he's completely entitled to share that story as are you as a mind\nAnybody anybody taking traveling anybody extrapolating from that same call I'm actually going to join the military overthrow as well that would be stupid for them to conclude that [noise]\nI I mean with this is what this is what happened to this is called ... the thing over and over again that happened you have Donald Trump who who repeats things or a Democrat which which which I break a losing argument\nBut that that just are you telling me that you shouldn't shares opinion about that are you telling me he he ... he thinks it's a witch on various zero evidence of collusion that is his opinion and he can say it every day and some people can get\nSome people cannot like it but don't try to Muslim people you say whatever you want to say whatever I Want other callers well president well for the freedom of speech membrane let's all judge what can I can say this [noise]\nHim from a good\nA good thing\nI had always come back to my\n[noise] and I have had at that that's happening\nAnd now it mailed election day it may I ... I Hope this I mean not because I Want bad things to happen to anybody\nBut I Hope that there is a rebuke for for Democrat tactics I Hope some people vote Republican 'cause they're conservative and they weren't Republicans to succeed and maybe some folks vote Republican just to deliver a message to the sorry sorry behavior of today's Democratic Party\nYeah well thanks for taking my call\nMy pleasure thank you appreciate it already uh\nEight by seven on stage eight at eight times having on stage led us role to Tampa Tim hey Mark Davis and Larry how are you [noise]\nHave you had on good thank you\nNice to talk on the part of her and I've heard many times thank you said you know you know nobody is bringing up that this could be the Chinese or the Russian San Jose's\nFaith say look look the\nSpeculation game you know we can play it as a parlor game all day it could be this could be that it really could be anything until we know [noise] um [noise] oh no I Am time something comes up I Try to think okay what would be the exact reason for that as a justice sow discord is just to get us all hopped up and I don't\nMaybe maybe and any paintings anything's possible\nThing than doing her some days or even\nBefore that I guess I'm trying to think\nI'm I'm I guess I'm trying to think of what exactly okay well let's say with the Chinese let's say where the Russians and here we are in Moscow or Beijing and the point in which someone says okay let's have some of our operatives than the incendiary looking devices to key Democrat\nOr what's in it for us how how does how does that help us\nLaw does I wouldn't want out of college so I mean no no I don't know how how does that help\nThem you we're ... we're we're the Chinese and the Russians I put myself in their uh\n... ... what reason would they have what reason where they have for doing that\nTo get Democrats who don't like military building or don't like the things that Republicans had to do the\nChart oh okay I ... so that that would be a reason this kind of real bomb it blows up I don't even know if these are ... are are competent we put together bombs or if they've clearly tried to scare people I have a feeling it's a real Chinese ...
