[noise] I took a picture of it and I posted it on Twitter and Facebook and somebody wrote and said very starkly [noise]\nThis is not your heritage\nRoll back an attached a link to a prominent Web Web site that's at twenty five percent of cowboys were black [noise]\nAnd I said so in fact it is my heritage [noise]\nIf you go on line you'll find that number twenty five percent a pretty commonly cited [noise]\nI contacted a friend of mine historian Roger McGrath who teaches are taught for a long time American West in California history of UCLA [noise]\nAnd um I asked him about twenty five percent number and he said there were a number of black cowboys many of whom were quite prominent\nAnd maybe about twenty percent of the blacks were on cattle drives in certain places but the number twenty five percent is wildly inflated and he said and I used to teach a course in this and when I talked about the number of being inflated I was accused of being racist\nSo I Would have talked to a Roger McGrath about the percentage of a black cowboys how did the number to get to be twenty five percent how would they treated and I also want to ask you about this movie Django that um [noise]\nUh when parents you know put out he said he wanted to create a hero for black people as if they weren't already black cowboys I Want to ask a historian whether or not a Django helped to hurt the cause of historical accuracy about the American west all coming up and just a few minutes\nBut first the um Reuters is reporting that a Russian had been charged with conspiring to interfere in us congressional elections and a\nOr can't pronounce the last name became the first person charged with a crime for interfering with twenty Eighteen elections chief accounting for something called project lacks a operation started and twenty fourteen funded by Russian oligarch\nAnd um this Russian oligarch and to other companies were indicted or back in February and special counsel Robert Mueller separate investigation of alleged Russian meddling\nThe complaint details new examples of Russians using fake persona on social media to stoke arguments about race and other contentious issues [noise]\nNow I had written and talked about how USA Today looked at all of the uh Facebook ads that the Russian box purchased a and a the overwhelming majority of them had to do with race\nAnd sometimes they were pro black sometimes they were anti black only a handful had to do with specific mentioned of Hillary or I'm Donald Trump basically they were just trying to sow ratio discord\n[noise] now how can something like this actually have an impact on election they could have an impact on the election or given the fact that the left constantly talks about how racist America is the Russians are watching the same news that\nUh that everybody else watches they watch MSNBC or they watch CNN they see this constant constant constant drumbeat America Says to show the races systemically racist black lives matter you ought to block cetera\nMy point is whom do you think has a bigger impact on how people think and how people vote Russian bought or the left wing media constantly talks about racism or sexism income inequality homophobia\nMy friend him grow closer when I wrote the book called left turn\nSaid that of the primary news sources between eighty Ninety percent of them are left wing and if the news media were truly fair and balanced the average state would vote the way Texas does which is about eight to ten point in favor of a Republican so if you want to look at impact on elections\nLook in the mirror mainstream media because you have a far bigger impact\n\nAnd even if you argue that the uh media point of view a legitimate point of view\nNinety percent how's it balanced how was the answer is it's not\nFar far more impact during the two thousand eight election you've got people like\nThose who are in that organization called journalist report is literally going back and forth on line discussing ways we can minimize the impact of the revelation of Jeremiah Wright\nUh on the Obama campaign here here's what we can do we can pick any conservative let's find somebody Karl Rove Fred ...
