A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com and a lot of you've done that\nAnd you'll find out on my website and all these other sites where I Will be appearing next besides filling in for learning or dentists or whatever I Do other stuff to\nLast hour talked about the effort of the left to blame these would be bombings on President Trump\nBecause the left and the media and the Democrats hate him in this segment I Want to talk about what a great job in the ... a color at the end of the other our asked me to do that what has he done that's so good I think he didn't think there was anything but I Want to talk about what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office\nI sit for months now that I care less about what he says and much more in what he does\nHis tweets are not always helped him and he's in my opinion is after many people who shouldn't\nAnd engaged with people beneath his position to his detriment I I play tennis a lot\nAnd uh when uh sometimes on the court people kind of know who I Am and they try to get my vote I just don't answer them off and I am I getting paid for this getting paid I'm not answering your guts but he talked and you know get some debates with people who shouldn't\nBut I never expected him to govern in such a conservative way he's far surpass my expectations for him I must admit he was not my first choice in the primary season\nI was actually a Ted Cruz delicate in my initial judgment I thought Trump was only better than John Case like which isn't saying much because ... will be a Democrat\nBut I have long since admitted that far from being the worst choice or the second worst choice for president he may have very well being the only Republican that could have one in fact I've wondered out loud and the caller suggested this last hour if president Providence was involved in this election\nAfter all a bomb had done you know talk about radically changing our country you might have very well been too late to turn America back of Hillary had one\nAnd I don't know if you know Bruce ... he ran against Barbara Boxer the but when she ran for the U.S Senate and I asked him if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country and the answer of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd wasn't also Providence I Wonder that we got George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most\nYou get no argument from me about cause involvement and now I think we got Donald J Trump with all this personal shortcomings when the country needed him most yesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election\nOf course that doesn't matter much either considering we fish fry against and remember many of us thought he would be very satisfied we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges especially from the Supreme Court\nSo I thought were way ahead of the game when he pointed Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court\nBut he didn't stop there\nLet me go through the list that the caller wanted ending the Obamacare mandate opening up the Keystone Pipeline than Anwar reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy\nA significant tax cut I don't know why he talks about it but not enough Republicans do lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms moving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords was drawn from the disastrous Iranian deal\nMeeting with Kim all young to possibly produce the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula getting American remains he's already done that returned from North Korea [noise]\nMaking sure our borders means something yeah color from last hour\nWho knows what people are up to there just isn't it a coincidence that the coming right around the election and a mom who knows how they're getting paid how they're supporting themselves yeah I've heard local church groups and so on but this isn't just organized spontaneously\nAnd of course naming now the second Supreme Court a choice a few weeks ago and he was successful another I'm Brett Kavanaugh solace goes on and on and the American people love that he is not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who Spain and Spain and spin that's where we are talking about last hour and are afraid to say what they are really thinking you don't have\nThat problem you can never say that about President Trump he may say too much but he never has two little\nHe is one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he has done a great job and most of the American people get but it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or the comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the less this the Democrats and liberal listeners so maybe it was for this if the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected he's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nYou are dreaming if you think he's going to be defeated you a failed to get rid of him but not for lack of trying you start in the day he won\nActual we now know that they start their resistance again ... against the much before election day but was election day came they couldn't believe that this so called bumbling fools had won\nSo bumbling but he's still one no matter what the upper lead of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed he won\nAnd I almost I mentioned this last hour in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania\nWhich always seemed like a Republicans fool's gold down we're always going to win around who's gonna win ... W was going to win it but not only did he win but they are despite their best effort see one\nHe's still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the Muller persecution\nOr is that prosecution gotta think about that which was which one is that no matter the hostile media no matter the never Trump spurs no matter all the elites in the swamp President Trump is still here which never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor appointed\nAnd including the best efforts in terms of the bomber it won't work even though they won accused him of being responsible for the bomber he's accused of everything and anything they can come up with he still hear\nIt never should have happened with the ... investigation of profit Jeff Sessions as an aside I'm disappointed he never recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nBut typically politicians talk to our adversaries re did she talk the Russians remember the reset button remember Obama saying after he was reelected that he would take care of it and you know they work work it out and he promised that off Mike\nSo all of this you know I'm disappointed in sessions disappointed is lack of oversight should fire Rosenstein but the fact is President Trump\nHas the feed it all of this and as we said last hour the press can handle it they can accept that this guy talks back then he says well we've been thinking all these years\nThat's why people are so thrilled with him finally we got someone in the Republican Party that had some courage it's about time\nThat someone standing up for what we believe in let me know what you think [noise] eight eighty nine seven one stage eight eight eight seven to nine to one

you were bad he was trying to your your out and make America great again\nAnd it didn't matter what side you're on but if you were bad and all these people that are against some\nAre wondering like little dogs but they're dealing with three or like\nThat and I think the Democrats overplay their hand let's go to Joe in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania you're on was mark\nHey mark I just don't understand I Can't get this through my head why Hillary Clinton isn't being held accountable when she opened recalled for civil unrest last week um until the Democrats are back in power when you do that and you have a national or international audience\nGo wackos or want to come out of the woodwork and she should be held accountable for making that statement\nYeah but Joe she's on the other side chicken say anything she wants [laughter]\nRight [laughter] I you know what ... me the other day as far as ... concerned how the how to eliminate all media coverage say hey we're going to let them in but they have to register Republican\nIn the delivery how can you not hear anything about the cabin anymore yeah you're a great\nIn fact a you know I I agree with you if there was any thought\nThat illegal immigrants who are voting for Republicans in huge numbers certainly even in a majority\nWhy do I have a strong feeling that the Democrats would be against illegal immigration like they were four years right there are a lot of clips from buying into a Clinton uh to Hillary Clinton all of them are against illegal immigration but now that it's convenient\nAnd they need the vote by the way\nIf they lose a minority votes in the proportions that Trump seems capable of doing the words they Democrats are always get what Nineteen Ninety five percent of the vote in Obama's case if it ever starts to go the other way they are in huge trouble because\nThat's what they count on that count as I mentioned the store with ... that they cannot just wrote here's what we do we vote for the Democrats they care about the poor the fact that they have and help the poor the fact that if you looked at the school system I teach part time and see what it's like an inner city none of that seems to matter their immune to that\nBecause what they have on their side they have to press they have the media they have the schools certainly have the colleges they have so many things going for them that it's no wonder that the Democrats get so many votes from among minorities because they don't know\nThey don't know that a lot of the stuff they've been hearing and listening to all these years has done them no good\nThey told over and over again Republicans are evil they teach you there for big business yeah we didn't even get the big business will last time most of the rich people in this country voted for Obama and certainly it wasn't a choice vote for Hillary Clinton\nSo this idea that Republicans for for all of our big business and the Democrats or the poor and the people who and we had a court challenge me on that or for the poor and and the disenfranchised each not true\nAnd that's what President Trump appeals to so many people because one of those things that gets him in trouble like everything in life there's a balance theory also helps and they know he says what he's thinking there is none of this spin and all the stuff the politicians usually do would you say one thing and then lose another way\nTo do with a different way this guy is different he's surprised me\nHe said some things on Twitter and do you know treat some things you wish she wouldn't\nBut the American people are thrilled that they finally got a president that standing up for the United states of America finally got a president that understands that free enterprise is the thing that builds

special\nTo reward you and your family for tuning in and today we're going to focus on the health of the kidneys and nutritional support for the brain memory and of course the inseparable\nLymphatic kidney connection so we'll be talking about the ... system as well\nAnd so um what is the kidney do well it's a major player in keeping the blood pure and clean it filters massive amount of blood every single day and\nOften it doesn't have what it needs to do a really good job so\nWhat exactly does get the kidney in trouble well first of all not drinking enough water\nHardly anyone in America gets half ounce per pound a body weight of water per day and that's kind of the minimum so let's say you were a hundred and fifty pounds\nYou'd need Seventy five ounces of water a day it's a little bit less than three chords\nAnd unfortunately by not getting their water it's very very hard and the kidney the other problems for the kidneys are really it shares this with the brain is getting way too much\nRefined oil which is almost always omega six [noise] and then there by having a inadequate amount of omega three fatty acids and in particular the end chain form of\nOmega three that so needed by the brain and by the um the kidneys that's called the ha do cause ...\nAnd of course that also plays a role in promoting healthy inflammatory response now kid needs can also be in trouble because you've had a scar with trauma\nYou women when you have childbearing if the ...\nYou may not notice any problem with it for a long time even twenty Thirty years and then you start noticing that you have some water retention in the legs that demon and it looks like it's a mystery well it's really not a ministry the issue is\nIs very old uh scarred trauma the feeds the automated now there are many other types of\nDramas that can occur that may affect the low back and in effect kidney as well so what do we do to really give her shelves great help for the kidney because it's so important\nTo our energy and our power through the day so number one you can jump on one of our are really great devices and this is really important for the skin to as a device called the high drama never very inexpensive and its handheld\nAnd it says censor that can tell us how we're doing moisture wise within the various layers of the skin so you can make sure that you're drinking enough water every day for your body needs\nAnd this becomes a much more of a problem in very hot climates than it would be in colder climates\nYou kind of course supplement the ha and looking at American food\nUh and having done this for many many years and having tested thousands of people I Would say that everyone should supplement the shape of the do cause the heck's in Newark as it\nAnd that gives you two options won a vegetarian option we call it the ha two hundred which is a two hundred milligrams of omega three fatty as it\nUh from micro allergies so it's the clean is the least likely to deliver in the kind of attacks and\nHere you could take maybe three or if you've been to fish in a long time maybe you'll take five for a few months and then cut back to the street and our latest edition\nI'm a PHD ha which is from a fish oil without any molecular distillation or any weird things remaining we've been able to clean this oil\nAnd so if you are not a vegan you might consider this is a good option a teaspoon of the day is what we would recommend and\nThis guy is not only critical for great kidney help and just about everyone we do energetic testing on shows a shortfall for ... and\nSo we know this is something everyone should be using and of course it's critical to the nervous system and the brain as well so can we do more for kidney absolutely we've got a kidney support formula\nAnd this is a cause lives shores and it'll target nutrition right to the kid news show today will have the ha two hundred\nAnd or eat da da da boom on special and kidney support on special\nYou would buy

her symptoms that she gets caught it ate it and she got a ... like than she ah she get bloated and she just she has to be an end in a pill\nAnd forget guests in well the\nFirst thing you want to do obviously she's not very overweight how tall the woman is she\nKissed by three threes so she's got maybe twenty pound she's got to get rid of rent\nGoes over wages than those who came well\nNormally the easiest thing to do is go on a whole food plant based diet like the battlefield diet and I usually this is all you need to do\nBut in some cases it's a very stubborn you know\nWe may need other support to get the way down and we have a number of agents that can help to promote your toes says to get to losing weight quickly one is adapt agenda and here she would just take three at breakfast\nAnd the other one is our first ... blend here lean Quito bland and this guy features a green coffee beans and a number of other wonderful things to jump start and she would just take two of these at breakfast\nThis would be to jumpstart dropped the way when she starts the battlefield diet\nAs you would use low glycemic fruit in the morning that would mean blueberries blackberries strawberries something that she likes like that and try to make it up for our two five hour fast where she doesn't eat other food and to lunchtime this gives the body a chance to get in the fat burning mode\nNow she gets to lunch\nShe now is gonna be eating three times as much starch and she used to eat with the old food the with the old that and now she'll have pro fused bowel movement and she'll find that it's way easier to digest the food so lunchtime might be beans and rice\nAnd she can have plenty but the rice and beans are made without oil there's no refined oil that was the key to really dropping the way a no refined oil and you've greatly restricted meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products\nOkay Dr really great uh she's been getting some ... factions he has maybe three to four times a year\nThose those are very common with chicken dish and a lot of chicken she eats a lot of chicken\nAnd that and got to go that's what probably is doing that fifty percent of the chicken or ... infected with these ah with the organisms that commercial chicken with the organisms that may induce that kind of problem in the urinary tract\nOkay they cheat organic chicken and egg be better than no chicken no eggs oh no okay because\nEven the organic eighty seven percent is contaminated with salmonella\nOh wow so no so now let's talk about the acid reflux she's very young to have that so you want to make sure she's getting adequate salt\nShe can just go in his son or break a sweat and taste the perspiration the upper outer part of the arm should taste slightly salty if it does she's home free then I Would question if she's got a big star like a hysterectomy C section or are there any major scars on his Centre line at the body\nNow by she and she can't taste the salt on her farm\nOkay she is not the forum it's way up there you're ... you're just coming off the shoulder right they're\nAll coming up almost ... almost by the muscle\nGuys it is it's you know that little round one at the very top it's the midpoint of that oh okay okay okay yeah you a check on the wrong spot and if there's no major scar then and she has adequate solved then you've got to give her a digestive enzyme there's very young\nTo need that maybe she had some issues as a kid with anorexia or bulimia or if so then she may have damaged the stomach and then she would need at her body size one died just have to start at the meal\nAnd about to detain odd record at the end of the male okay [noise] okay thank you Dr high buddy\nTake care I think it'll be very happy with what happened so like I get ... or ... ... talked about Marshall pitched it as his health plan live or answering your questions let's go right back to the phones let's go to\nSusan in New York and she's got some irritation for Palestinians says she thinks she might have some candy to are you there Susan\nYes Hi Hi and how old woman are you and how much do you weigh\nAbout a hundred and Ninety\nWell the first thing that you want to know that of course you're approaching the age where you can't just hardly anything in the way of cooked food so obviously your first step\nTo reducing the irritation intestine is to make sure you can digest your food\nSo you would get on quantum down and just to maybe take a couple of those at the start of the meal\nThe end of the meal about for between ... and now you're dead ... more like you did in your twenties and this shouldn't be any rotting food hitting the got them the next step we have to look at is certain foods are more irritating than others\nCorn is one of those super irritated there's show you'd want to get rid of corn and you'll want to add vitamin D three ah we call it the three gold and maybe about six drops of this\nIn about one ounce of water\nAnd you would mix in that about four drops of lime and then now that's an essential oil of orange\nAnd it will uh most of my the the three so you mix it really good in the water and you see the big droplets or the three become tiny tiny now you know no matter what the state of your gall bladder you're going to absorb this this has been shown to promote\nAnd this is wonderful for promoting healthy immune response which you don't have right now and the other guy is ... from\nAny here you can get some capsules take maybe about\nFour per meal\nAnd this is a stand in immune system so the first thing that does is it provides human active in ...\nTo handle the first line of defense on the intestine so it's fares your immune system to deal with these other issues okay so this is a great simple thing you can do and you should have these around anyway in case you need them so it's\nReally really a great thing to do okay great\nFrontier to come down to take care bye\nBye now All right this is talk to Bob Marshall ... and this is health plan live in ... during your nutrition and health related questions\nAnd don't forget if you're sick and tired of being sick and tired then it's time to visit with like you are a practitioner someone who's mastered twenty first century clinical nutrition\nThey're going to be able to pinpoint exactly what you need so you can have a great healthy bones metabolism or digestion or go through the whole body\nDepending on what your the killer objectives are and they're going to be able to give you just exactly what she needs to the body can perform so much better it can also find a test case guard traumas he may not even realize you have\nThat had been interfering with the health of a key or going to Glenn\nAnd given enough time twenty thirty forty years\nThose interference fields could destroy the organic land to which they reflects so they can mud pack that area fix the problem and a symbol full of nutrition\nCan outperform a wheelbarrow full before so give a bus to the ... there'll be happy to help you with the names of some practitioners in your area\nYou would align eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven right this is Dr Bob Marshall pitch Davis's health plan in line\nAt school right back to the phones let's go to Julie in Irvine, California and she's got some problems with the thumb and wrist area and really doesn't want to have cortisone shots surgery are you there Julie\nHow about taking my call\nYou're welcome how old woman or even how much the way\nI Am thirty twelve\nVery very young to have this sort of problem it was it spawned by an injury a blow a fall or what\nI Know it's too much to try to stay I got the information going on trying to treat it actually I don't want to take all the fat fat comes\nWell the first thing you need to know is that it's almost ... issue or that you've got an interference field does scar trauma blow maybe you fell horn on the wrist as a small child or\nAdolescent and that's what's blocking and building this problem\nIn other words the other side is just fine but you're not using it the same [noise] uh I don't believe that moving your mouse will ever do it on you know twice your age and I moved ... miles for a million times but I Will tell you\nThat I grew up in New York where our past time was fighting and my wrists were a mess I must have done\nSo many many mode packs on both of my risk to get them to show their pain free and that they work the way they're supposed to\nBut you could do the same thing instead of hitting something or someone by falling down\nAnd I'd be looking hard at that and especially when it's only one hand and the other hand seems to be pretty good and I think you're right though that a surgery in cortisone shots these are going to treat your symptom need you need to get to the cause so a couple of things that you can take\nThat promote healthy inflammatory response one of them is bone and joint\nAnd at your body size maybe three per meal will be plenty [noise] and then a vegetarian\nDa da da da da du ... [noise]\nAnd taking maybe ten of those at your main meal you can show them spit out the capsule it tastes good but you'd be taking it with you know food that had protein\nLike beans and rice or whatever else you're eating okay and that or to make a big difference reducing foods that are pro inflammatory like eliminating eggs\nEliminating poultry\nAnd restricting red meat to maybe a red meat or fish to know more\nThan once per day and also barrier to restrict dairy 'cause all of those are pro inflammatory\nCount at some point you might as\nWell and you just um it's time for you to love that body a little bit better and make some changes and I think that by making those changes the worst guy in town is gonna be ... next runner up his poetry and the next runner up is dairy\nShow those guys give them a Ninety day holiday I think you may have a new lease on life\nOkay I'll Try to take care of by now all\nRight this is Dr Bob Marshall PHD this has helped mine lives and we get near the end of the broadcast guys so if you're on the line and I don't get to you just stay there will catch all the here and I just want to do a quick recap of today's great specials in addition to are\nHuge aid two hundred directly how the brain but of course the ... the measure than the kidneys and so much more or quantum Roseberry drone one of the best and the accidents on the planet\nAnd does so much more er into a drink so that's on special and of course we also have our brain support in our cell resident nerve support on special\nAnd of course her kidneys support\nFor the power of a man or woman and ... been going to have our daily multi on special today and this is for the folks who\nWill only take one bill and you could give them may be five or six capsules of this\nUh this is my favorite because it's alive the store's not synthetic circa Nineteen ... the ... the dead synthetic things that are in it it's in a vegetable gap so so it's not going to hurt your there are no have living toxic tag along the in it\nAnd this one is perhaps the only daily multi you can find that has great comprehensive\nNutrient dense food sources as its delivery system that's our daily multi and it's also an special you buy one get the second one\nFifty percent off that's twenty five percent off each just give a both the Orlando if you missed any of those feel free to call them they're going to help you with all that that's eight hundred three Seventy [noise]\nThirty four forty seven\nYou've been listening to Dr Bob Marshall PHD on health land line to find out more about these ... or any of our other great product called one eight hundred three than Andy thirty\nFour forty seven that the one eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty than Dr Marshall comments have not been evaluated by the FDA and I'm not intended to diagnose and treat cure or prevent any disease how they how they eat and rainy and [noise]\nYou\nBeen to the doctor Bob Marshall PHD on health blind live where your questions and concerns about ongoing health challenges are addressed with the latest nutritional protocols and questions day technology thanks to everyone who called in\nDid you didn't get your question on the air calling the eight hundred three Seventy [noise] thirty four forty seven and one of his trained associates can help you you're good health is important to us don't forget to take advantage of our daily blockbuster special at eight hundred three seven eight thirty or forty seven\nThat's eight hundred three seven eight thirty or forty seven [noise] you can create healthy and happy new [noise]\n\nProceeding was a commercially programs sponsored by quantum nutrition lab shepherd is expressed on this\nProgram and on the side it's just beat the other guy\nOn dot com we'll listen to talk radio people showed us a call and the state was on our mind get answers or try to solve the problems of the world and I was the other guy editor on dot com I saw the other problems with the world but I get calls to only I get to hear what she thinks and to this day still amazes me how many national smells\nAnd just how desperate you want the odor going by some of those discussions about the dog and camping and ... called the dog and brought them in the houses\nWere sweat and body odor and\nEven when the family has ... million we talk about bathroom smells kitchen gardening but in terms of popcorn I Can't get the ... well after the Brussels sprouts and then there's the mold will do others in the basement of the oil gasoline spills in the garage or SUV smoke smell from an unfortunate far we're ...
