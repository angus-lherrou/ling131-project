venues Supreme Court justice if Democrats take control of\nThe housing but will you support would you support an impeachment effort if your party controls the how\nThe I word impeachment when it comes to office the president any longer but now I'm Brett Kavanaugh it's something that you went to court if he were elected in\nCongress do you think it is a good move for Democrats politically strategically ethically morally to pursue potentially an investigation that could lead to impeachment\nNow than painting not the president but Brett Kavanaugh now that he had Supreme Court justice running on this idea that Democrats are are at the Democrats intend to end the ... and the way to get the enthusiasm about the nomination and play I guess it realistic to expect\nAn investigation that could potentially end with impeachment\nProceeding Kavanaugh they get control of the house possibly looking at impeachment uh what do you make of those pledges are there will be an attempt to impeach a justice capital I think\nThat it shouldn't be that would you support the house investigation at the start for an impeachment vote and to judge capping off\nDemocrats could launch impeachment proceedings open investigations hearings against Kavanaugh but again the entire ... how much pressure\nAre Democrats here under when their vote for their voters\nI sang in politics I read this

even better ... let's just talk about now what I saw that and\nSo they're not paying wait hold on you're conceding that they're not paying taxes and how I thought having talked to many times you're always was they're paying into the system more than they're taking out which I said we ... we started on more taxes well why don't they they went to war like wait wait wait citizens don't pay more taxes\nEverybody who works pays the taxes paid our tax rate so you're conceding that a lot of these people edition of break our immigration are breaking our tax law and\nThey're using fake IDs I said

things on the whole as a in a world of Larry\nDr ... thank you very much I'll talk to you next week let God Bless we come back Dennis Rodman Dennis Rodman Kanye West in the oval office [noise]\nI'm Larry Larry Elder all true [noise]\n\n\n\nI promise you this will not make your life better and also once bashes get power they don't give it up you've got it in from for life [noise]\nI Know liberate us made a big mistake because we attacked Dearborn Bush like he was the end of the world and he wasn't and Mitt Romney we attack that way I gave a bomb a million dollars because they're afraid of Mitt Romney\nMitt Romney wouldn't have changed my life that much or [noise]\nBut you're not attacking Donald Trump by calling him a fascist apologizing for attacking Romney apologizing for attacking Bush and then promptly falls Donald Trump fashion [noise]\n'cause that's what they're doing the getting away with it it's bigotry\nAnd Kanye West\nSays he grew up without a father\nAnd told a President Trump today in the oval office how much that bothered him\nAnd it is far and away the number one problem in this country the number one problem in the black community the large number of kids growing up without fathers\nFar and away nothing else that even close all the other stuff people talk about all this other nonsense\nFar and away and you have somebody\nCalling us you can call them uneducated you can call him a not terribly literate calling what you want at least he gets the big picture\nView also understand\nThat there's a connection between the welfare state and the demise of the family\nMy friend Walter Williams and Thomas all have written about the black family after slavery\nA black kid was more likely during slavery to be raised under a roof with biological mother and biological father than today\nAnd after slavery because\nFor years it was illegal for slaves to marry\nIt was a huge uptick in Mary and if you look at census reports Eighteen Ninety Nineteen hundred Nineteen ten a black child was slightly more likely\nTo be brought into the world with a biological mother and a biological dad under the same route than a white kid more likely and then along comes the welfare state and dependency\nAnd the LA Times asked both for people to non poor people questions about welfare and about dependency they ask the question to Nineteen eighty five they asked him again or in twenty sixteen\n[noise] do you believe welfare creates dependency or do you believe it is a stepping stone to get you on your own two feet and they asked poor people in non poor people those questions\nForty one percent of people living below the level of poverty responded welfare creates dependency and forty one percent felt that he gave you a stepping stone or to get on your own two feet so as many poor people felt that welfare which harmful as felt that it was helpful\nSo don't you think maybe just maybe that's worth looking at that's a topic worthy of discussion if many poor people think that welfare as bad a ethic it's good and about eight percent or so have no idea that don't have an opinion one way or the other\nThat is a boatload of people on welfare who believed that it created dependency and that's what Kanye West we're talking about you don't think it's worth having the conversation of course you don't know if you're on the left because you look into the mirror and say oh my goodness\nWhat have I done to destabilize families\nThe chains values to change incentives\nMy dad just told me people are motivated by two things\nPromised again in fear of loss
