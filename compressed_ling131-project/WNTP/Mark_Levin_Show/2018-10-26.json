talk show ever on W. okay be Jacksonville, Florida a\nYear they say Oh yes I Do think that that was the reaction of the time [laughter]\nSo many radio career is find a hundred radio guys and many of them will probably tell you a story about how it ended being fairly young and just being in the right place at the right time where somebody gives you an opportunity to do something and you have absolutely no idea what\nYou can do it but you know your show up you don't embarrass yourself for them and uh and look what happened to thirty six years later on most of the show holy\nCow so thanks thanks thanks Sarah everybody listening when we're here Sebastian Gorka is here tomorrow and I'm back on Monday before Larry's return\nOn um on Tuesday of next week All right I'm let's let's hit the reset top of the hour we sat on what we're doing the mystery packages\nI Am hearing a lot of skepticism about the preferred narrative of we have a conservative terrorist I'll believe we have a conservative terrorists when we have a conservative terrorists in handcuffs being arrested and fingerprinted till then I Am open to absolutely anything\nOr even sharp Todd but it's kind of interesting\nEven Chuck Todd said today apparently [noise] uh how about the Russians\nSome some and and you know what I Do know conservative terrorist Russians Democrat prankster or any of the amount of ... absolutely no idea no idea\nOf the misspellings and ineptitude if it is the Russians and the Russian government that's in some you know idiot Russian guy in his basement and you know Michigan or something I I don't do so again the speculation games lovely parlor game you can play with your friends\nI have no idea and now they're ... so it makes it a very bad idea to jump in and like we kind of know and that's that's that's the third level of of noxious gas\nTo all this presumption and there's this gall to modern media culture has to lecture President Trump about his rhetoric when they call him a Hitler every day for lunch\nCome on man I'll take no lectures from CNN about civility and a a\n... decent see in a discourse our phone number is eight eight eight nine seven one stage so we we have no idea what's going on the package story let us lift up a prayer and every good wish for law enforcement and for the people who are working on mass so that we can get the bottom of it and maybe see pie and find out what a empty and find out what this was I'm going to say one thing\nYou can join me on this or not is free country if they don't find a suspect like in in weeks and I mean because if it was just some moron terrorist who happens to vote Republican\nUh they're going to find them probably by the weekend so if they don't find anybody for a few days year my skepticism is only going to grow but again I Will reach no conclusion I Will jump to a to know bottom line\nOf all of the game come to me\nHere's something I'm not going to lead come to me it was a caravan\nPresident Trump apparently in St mood deploying the military secretary of defense James Mattis signing deployment orders\nAs we speak sense of military down there I said for weeks that if if if this caravan gives the feeling they're about to get ... by the United states military and I don't mean they're going to get Bill run over by tanks or anything but um they may turn around and and think better of this\n[noise] let me let me do this I've been sitting on this this new column\nNews written an opinion piece in um on Fox News today\nMigrant caravan on the large what we must do it for when the caravan arrives at our border ready here we go [noise]\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand Central American invaders trekking through Mexico toward the United states is roughly one thousand miles from the nearest point of entry a second group of roughly one thousand is also seeking to joined them\nThey may still be weeks away from our border but there's leaves a little time for President Trump\nCongress and all Americans who care about our national sovereignty and the rule of law to solve three incredibly pressing challenges searched we must determine and do what we can right now to end this invasion before it reaches our doorstep\nSecond we must develop and execute a cohesive efficient effective plan for preventing these invaders from illegally crossing our border and force swiftly deporting those who are successful\nAnd finally we must fix the debilitating leaf stupid amalgam of immigration laws policies and court rulings that enable and encourage migrants to band together and stage these types of illegal invasions\nShould we fail to solve any of these problems are already dysfunctional immigration system will be further cripple our relationship with Mexico at our Central American neighbors could be severely damaged\nOur border will be overwhelmed by droves of new migrants and America will become significantly less safe\nIf is Tara man is allowed to get through the end of the U. S. that X caravan will be even bigger the one following that will be enormous according to the gala boiled both twenty nine percent of people who wants to migrate from Latin America and the Caribbean want to make the United states they're permanent home\nThat is thirty seven million people who want to come here we must demand and ensure that they do so legally\nDeclares dancer to alleviate induced issue while the Caribbean is still in Mexico is for Mexico to stop it president\nTrump has already made clear that securing the border is more important than our recent trade agreements with our southern neighbor Mexico should take him seriously\nMany of the members of this caravan forced their way through the Guatemala Mexico border they're already in violation of Mexican law Mexican law enforcement should take action\nFurthermore we should not underestimate the degree to which human traffickers and transnational criminal gangs such as that has Thirteen and other cartels are involved with this invasion force\nMexican authorities should also be seeking to weed these elements out of the caravan and dealing with those who may have legitimate asylum claims through the Mexicans system\nAre Mexican neighbors must understand that while they did not assertively deal with this problem at their southern border they will own problem if it gets to their northern border this relates to what we must do it for when the Caribbean is allowed to arrive at the U.S border\nPresident Trump should instruct attorney general Jeff Sessions to issue a clarification to define the qualifications for asylum asylum is meant to provide protection for people who are fleeing real persecution and human rights abuses such as genocide simply being from a poor country that lacks opportunities does not\nQualify someone for asylum\nWe already have approximately seven hundred and fifty thousand backlogs asylum cases\nThese invaders should be screened preferably in Mexico so they never entered the U.S just a federal government should also immediately begin coordinating with local and state governments along the border to develop an organized completely non violent system that can deter these migrants from crossing into the United states\nTexas already worked with federal officials to prepare for mass migration events other border states should follow suit we must overwhelming invaders stop them and they're attracting quickly return them to their home countries\nOur immigration system has been completely broken by Democrat back laws to make it easier for immigrants to flood our system and stay in our country while their cases take years to process\nThe immigration system has been further hobbled by activists judicial rulings that of ties the hands of border enforcement officials and prevented them from keeping track of those who cross the border illegally once we deal with the immediate problem of this invasion caravan\nRepublicans and the White House must work to fix our broken immigration system once and for all\nNewt Gingrich with an opinion based right there at Fox News dot com for your consumption if you wish party I'm about to consume some of your calls and we'll talk to each other about things and not a slow Newsweek so pick your favorite and let's go eight eight eight nine seven one stage Mark Davis in for Larry at Mark Davis on Twitter\n[noise] good uh I called about the uh his fishes back yeah\n[noise] do they how first of all a like a childish attempt and they may have been assembled by you and all cause to canals DNA and print it and there wouldn't be in the food [noise]\nAnd that we could eliminate one says that Ted Kaczynski\nWas yes I suppose we again yet but you but you know the Unabomber case is interesting because he was ship and stuff to people and they didn't find him for years so I'm I'm fairly confident the I'd Gabby I'm confident in law enforcement most things like this and they start out as absurd\nMysteries and then you turn your head in the day or two or three or four later they gotta suspects like wow how did you guys do that they're miracle workers it's incredible but they'll say it's not miracles is hard solid police work and diligence in work ethic\nAnd God Bless them and um I ... I Hope we can get a few things settled here by finding a suspect a pretty soon we are in Anderson a South Carolina hey Sean Mark Davis and for Larry how you doing [noise]\nHey why not one of my car was\nAt the moment I look back I bomb issue it reminded me every time you see spruce minority uh\nAt the college campuses where someone spray paint a troubling negative and then it turns out to be the exact victim that are ... you know the climate that we're that does happen ... or\n... or or\nThe you know what I'm Talking about we're we're going to be at the air force academy high school there and and the the the head guy they're delivered this impassioned thing was was beautiful it was it\nWas very gripping a\nHow we don't tolerate that are that doesn't speak for us so we have to rise above this and it was a lovely lovely thought a lovely lovely speech and you're trying to think it was a scam for black kids in it\nSo that everybody says oh there's so many people do they agree that that I mean and and so so what I put this past them I Would not not in this would be typical it would be completely in character you getting nothing is beneath them\nBut does that mean that I somehow over they did this or or even have an active leaning toward and now I'm staying wide open I recommend everybody do the same let the let\nThe the law enforcement folks do their work at some point we will have a suspect and then\nWe'll know a lot more about what we're talking about here so to talk about some more stuff coming up Mark Davis in Larry Elder following at Mark Davis on Twitter eight eighty nine seven on said we'll continue\nOur marriage saw Larry\nNine nine intelligence\nConservative talk\n[noise] with us\nOur News I'm Keith leaders in Washington a law enforcement source tells the Associated Press that Miami Dade police have gone to the male sorting facility in ...

California\nIf you want to have even a ghost of a chance I got to find a lot of people to give you a lot of money and actually get in there into the arena and actually play for real otherwise it's kind of vanity project but hey\nOr or just a or a Facebook ranch or whatever all of which is great I express ourselves is fantastic so I I Wish you well I Wish you truly do now I'm as a matter of fact and an interesting story here but I'm saying\nYeah Dianne Feinstein up on a daily on and only debate debate said California needs a new voice California state senator Kevin daily on\nUm ... ... ... ...\nTo me when California is his goal has been interesting to me Larry lived there that I was kinda funny on the stage last night ... Larry a dentist Prager all of California experience I've been out there a ton of the south is very different than the north in orange county is very different than Marin County et cetera et cetera et cetera [noise]\nUm but even here in Texas where there's a lot of attention being paid to a judge whether Texas can be turned purple or\nIt on the way to being blue ... ... can be sure it can can it be\nAbsolutely or will it be this year new and in fact I also promised you a little bit of a of inside baseball on on Ted Cruz in beta O'Rourke a tendency to win by close to double digits and\n... but because it ... it's it's not the beta was a flawed candidates or he's ill spoken or anything like that in his ideas are relatively mainstream liberal and if you were a candidate in\nCalifornia or New York\nMassachusetts you'd probably be doing pretty well but guess what its taxes we have Democrats in taxes we just don't let them run the place and we don't send them to the Senate already\nTelephone

Elder show oh California I'm In\nCalifornia where\nThat top two primary system are you all crazy now it's kinda funny as soon as I finish talking to this guy if I you know that's a that's earth logic for everything boils down to a a\nCalifornia US Senate races showing the weird effects of uh of these phenomena Kevin de Leon is not only is he a democratic cars but he's the one who got the endorsement of the state Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein didn't get it mass arrest of America\nGet all and and pardon me everybody in California you call in show appreciate that the end it's the top two primary system than that has denied Republicans a general election candidate a him is a contest your top two people bummed there you go [noise] ... that's crazy [noise]\nBut anyway it can affect that if you want to ah\nThe Dianne Feinstein is going to actually smoke Kevin de Leon I'm just it it it'd be it'd be here's here's the IRS logic you write in and you can apply this to Republicans you can apply to Democrats\nAnd uh and and here's the deal here is the deal\nYou have to have a burning desire to fire the income but if you're trying to beat an incumbent and the only way you're going to do it you can be pretty popular person pretty good candidate cetera et cetera is there's got to be a burning desire to fire the income but\nYeah I mean among the among actual voters under their their California Republicans who are dying to get rid of Dianne Feinstein guess what you're not the majority Dianne Feinstein is going to win and it's not going to be close [noise]\n\n\nReally for the day\nAnd I went to the show Mark Davis from six to answer DFW long distance running around for you yes I Am from fragile fragile or close to the edge\nDyslexia but the reason for that is it's being John Anderson's birthday John Anderson is Seventy four leaf vocalist on obviously as a\nRoundabout and the stuff you've actually hurting the magnificent four sides of tales from top of graphic ocean there was a mine trip or if you've ever in the mood for it and it's funny because of John Anderson lead vocals to yes is Seventy four he's only two years younger than McCartney\nAnd he was a Beagle when the Beatles very much a sixty is a\nPhenomenon yes very much a seventies phenomena but you know what\nYou know when when they were coddling together to the building blocks of yes Nineteen sixty eight [noise] so I mean the Beatles only been around for like four or five years and and and yes as Chris starting to crank out a progressive rock and\nPalate most people's heads explode there in Britain a late the late sixties anyway yes quite quite the record library there already a telephone number is eight eight nine seven one said eight eight eight nine seven one said Mark Davis\nIn Fort Larry Elder let me hit the reset ha tell you where exactly we are and what a mouse\nThat's on some things and then the idea is that you share your thoughts about some things and we hope that uh that you will do so eight eight eight nine seven ... eight eight eight nine seven on real quick as we begin or would you be the first on the movie everybody's talking about before the elections depths of the nation national issues is masterpiece\nIs on DVD about five days\nOctober thirtieth really thinks or your copy today at destination movie dot com death of a nation movie dot com directed it so you know it's compelling so go get that destination movie\nCom okay the mystery packages the story seconds the finger pointing continues and let's make a list\nOr we don't know and what we know this is how you stay sane throughout this entire thing right now my list of what we don't know and what we know may\nDiffer from yours you may think you know some things that I don't you may think some things that I think I Know are in dispute and that's why we\nHave telephone lines and so um to join us [noise] here's what we do not know we don't know who's on these packages that could be started the most basic we have no idea who said these packages or why [noise]\nI and that's where you stub your toes to the first time it's like wait a minute don't we know that this is some expression of hate for for liberal oh iconic figures clearly sent by some nut bag on on the right [laughter] oh we don't know any such thing\nThough is that probably the greatest possibility yeah because we have are not bags to\nKnow the left as guys who shoot up baseball fields and and the left has tons of people who ah will shot you ought to a restaurant and call like zombies the doors of the Supreme Court and do all kinds of other who feels off nonsensical thing we've um we've we've got our crazy too\nBut you know the thing that they started to\nWrap itself around me when the story first began and and the\nAnd the tally of mysterious packages started to grow\nSaid you know doesn't tend to be something we do and\nI and why in the world wouldn't exactly be now that's earth logic why would you do it sometimes you send somebody a pipe bomb 'cause you want to kill him but you know ain't nothing exploded yet you know what I mean and I think that was the one and sources mailbox where the where the the white powder was nothing it was in art\nNow and then by the way that doesn't make it okay if you send somebody something just to scare the or the ... out of them that that's a terrorist act\nAs well so you don't have to blow up for you to have done something very very illegal but is it okay for you if you keep that\nThat hoax antenna primed and dialed in you bet it's okay mine is now does that mean I'm\nDeclaring it a hoax I'm telling you I Know it's a hoax I notice the left doing this to the left so that we can you know spread out and have some myth of equivalency\nLike yeah we're Jason image we got a lot of restaurants were chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants we got Maxine Waters advocating hooliganism but you have your crazies do you're trying to kill the Clintons and the Obamas and Joe Biden and Robert Deniro you people are just like us\nYeah no we're not okay because even if even if we do find that this is one of the conservative lunatic you know what that is one conservative lunatic we have more to be sure\nBut um it it's not our rank and file really hopped up activists who are out doing things that countless thousands of leftist are doing\nAll the time there is no comparison so the thing that we don't know is who did this and why we do not know\nHere's what we do know a media culture that hates Trump's God's will do anything to tag him with this bad story\nAnd that is why you actually get I mean I I heard Wolf Blitzer I was kind of funny I was getting out of the car a dollar and those serious actually I'm In the car [noise] Wolf Blitzer talking to some congressmen or something so I really do is we have CNN just if you ever have the president's ear tell them that we we really try to get things right and we're not involved in fake news like will shut up dude it's pathetic it's sad\nI mean they got a great idea of you and Don Lemon you know want to go you know build a tree house in the backyard never a club meeting why don't you decided to start covering things barely covering things honestly lose the corruption fired you have a car to get your act together\nYou know lose the Trump deranged ... syndrome and become a real news organization because the the cries of fake news are real and deserved and valid\nAn accurate and I'll just try a ball around mess and then I'm going to your calls a day and eight nine seven on stage eight eight eight nine seven ... as the question hangs from the rafters\nShould the president dial back his rhetoric in view of the there's this package story or blah blah blah blah blah\nShort answer is no\nThere is nothing nothing in President Trump's rhetoric that somehow necessarily leads to somebody doing something like this even if it is a nut job conservative\nThere is zero connection to be made there none by thinking people\nBut by people who've had a bug up there but about Trump since the day he won there's plenty of material and they're going to use it and they're going to hammer it and they're going to bludgeon it and you know what it's going to backfire to\nJust like Kevin are just like the caravan best is going to backfire too you don't take voters are paying attention today say wait a minute what now this\nFirst we have ... media apologist planted embedded with the caravan trying to uh uh uh characterize it as as something noble pursuit\nAnd we have what the media and Senate Democrats did in the cabinet debacle and now they're taking this very admittedly unfortunate and scary story of devices showing up at a at some Democrat mailboxes\nAnd they tried to blame Trump for it are you kidding me this will make people crawl on broken glass to vote Republican\nSo please keep it up guys please keep it up\n[noise] we're in San Diego hey Sean Mark Davis into Larry how you doing\nA good ... are all good thank you I Want to call in and and respond to cover that they fought back and take just a moment to your child um but I thought you had to call it all in talking about he had two former Mexican military\nKatty Kay right very I mean I Will try America or add that propaganda running and not only that probably\nGoing to notice that propaganda it's it's an anecdote it's an anecdotal stories from a caller and I take it at at face value with a little bit of a grain of salt\nI mean any but that that type of thing and spread out your your\nList that day and time very big on the guy said to make things they're going to miss it\nSo he said he said no no no one to make up something I didn't say he he he he told a story about a couple of guys that he had conversations

with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the mark I just for show ... dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to on the show\nAs always you know miles email them for ... dot com sorry about that which many of you've done over the years you email me and I appreciate that very much\nAnd if you check my website is those other sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Larry Tanner fact I'll be filling in for Dennis Prager on Monday and this hour I'd be remiss if I didn't start out talking about the recent spate of bombs or at least the would be bombs I guess and the arrest of a suspect\nI don't even want to say his name because often these people like the fame or infamy for that matter that they acquire by these dastardly acts\nThe suspect but we did have previous arrests and was known to the authorities but we can't prevent every crime or a threat in this country I'm Amazed that we prevent as many as we do and and you know figure out who's up to what\nBut one has to be impressed with the quick action of the authorities to find the suspect\nIt never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are they are truly amazing and and in fact one of the things I set for all the years that\nYou know the top press is not that effective bought the day in and day out people who do the job are terrific\nAnd it was good to see by the way the FBI Director make a statement about the effectiveness of his team and others who helped out actually I don't know but I felt the FBI Director disappeared and he was on the FBI's ten most wanted list you know never hear from him into office like he doesn't exist\nI've not been happy with his lack of enthusiasm and taking actions against those who knows department who abuse their authority and they clearly did\nAnd speaking of unhappy with leadership I see where attorney general sessions if you're watching today he made a statement showing some leadership in one of his last\nMy opinion likely high profile lax\nBefore his dismissed I I think the only reason he's not being dismissed by the president is goes all the issues and people in the mall or investigation and everything else that's going on and\nHis next attorney general wouldn't be approved right now with you know what do you want another\nUh Kavanaugh hearing to take place this is not the time but he's never lived up to the expectations I have for him\nAnd I think many others did to a you know remember he was the first one that came out for President Trump's ... among the first senator who did so and he took some of what a risk so you think he's got courage he's a risk taker nah\nIt's like he's asleep at the wheel sometimes to\nActually now that I think of it he an FBI Director re never seemed to have the passion and energy that I think is necessary and their job and speaking of being surprised I was impressed with the postal employees who helped in this effort you know catch capture the suspect\nI never thought they were being so mean Sean I never thought they could move that fast and let me ... I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nI Know I was just thinking about that well you every you know there was an older you'll see them and if people remember Steve Allen did the Tonight Show and he wrote this book call I think it was dumb ass and he said he pulled up to the post office they have one heavy box he's having a lot of trouble lifting the box he finally gets to the counter at the post office and\nThe clerk and Steve Allen is the only one there he was before Johnny Carson and the coach says where's your number\nAnd Steve Allen says I don't have a number he says well you'll have to go back to not much we can freeze the box always a back post that weren't you know those numbers like you might get at a bakery or at a deli counter something\nGrabs the ticket comes back with the heavy box walks up to the counter he's the only one there and the postal clerk says Thirteen call says number but that's the postal service right that's always been the reputation hey but you got to give them credit seems those who investigated these kinds of things that an excellent job\nOf but seriously it never ceases to amaze me a professional an excellent our law enforcement people are well I don't you know President Trump says we have the best of the ...\nI think in in this case you know is around the world when there's investigations of plane crashes or any issue like that but you know last plane lost ships whatever it was called the United states we have tremendous law enforcement people\nWhich by the way it's on the side was why are so disappointing to see the upper echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department\nEngage in a soft coup I think a lot of people's knowledge that now against the ... legitimately elected president of the United states Donald Trump or unhappiness with these top officials as I said was never meant to reflect on the regular agents those who do the work day in and day out and the FBI and other agencies\nWhich as I said that's why so it was disgraceful to see those in power tarnished the image of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and then you have the Democrats saying\nAll the Republicans don't support the FBI know who do support the FBI we don't support it becoming you know its image being so tarnished and so ruined because someone you engaged in an old like a banana republic activities that's why we're unhappy with the top people or the Justice Department people like Clapper Brennan and the rest of them\nSo whether the suspect winds up being someone with the mental issues\nOr someone who's just evil\nThe fact remains that in this country you do not get back at your political enemies by threatening them with harm or worse you just don't do that\nNeedless to say these type of acts can do irreparable damage to our political system\nAnd the you know even you know on the line I think of what the uh the Hillary Clinton people in the left and those who are out to get the president is what they were doing that's why we're so disastrous someone should be pointed that out when he tried to do the political system is what you guys already did with the political system and trying to get a legitimately elected as a president or impeached\nNoone can defend this behavior and everyone should condemn it this is pure evil no matter which side of the political spectrum the perpetrator is on and it looks like we all know sure looks like what did he have uh\nStickers on his van and actually it looks like one of those crazy is that you want to be around no matter what side but heck and certainly we all get deeply frustrated and disappointed when people we disagree with control our destiny\nIt always amazes me that those in the resistance against President Trump have no clue nor did they probably care that we were as unhappy with his election and the reelection a President Obama to the presidency as they were with President Trump's victory\nThat would never dawned on them never never never dawned on them [noise]\nAfter all many of us thought Iraq Obama was the worst president in our lifetime if not in our history so what are the announcer was five days I think it was five days before the election that he wanted to fundamentally change the United states of America\nWe are\nModel if you're not as\nI always got the wrong I always thought it was seven days that he really gave us notice you quickly for job you to give to let us know ... days before at what previous presidents I Want to ask you had said anything even close to that\nAnd which president went on an apology tour soon after being reelected\nHistory has made one a leader steps up stays true to his values sharks are fundamentally different course for the country\nThat's 'cause you're not in power when you get a power I Wonder if you agree that we should try a different course when we get in power that he was talking about Obama I didn't even know that well he should have was right yeah [noise]\nAnd apologize for what you may know my sign up is always a pleasure privileged to have a like front of the greatest history a country in the history of the world\nBut we're on our side never engaged in a resistance as such we never engaged in a soft coup we never threatened to bomb the White House than those actresses or singers threatened that like that march that day of or the day after whatever was\nOr printed you see this in the New York times uh about the assassination of the current president I guess it's supposed to be fiction obviously but ah we don't do that kind of stuff but the left and the Democrats and the press which is really the same thing\nHas never accepted as a victory and will do anything to remove him from office that seems clear including blaming his rhetoric for the suspects violence which is where I'm going to go now even before anything they knew you know they didn't know much about the suspect\nSo this will be used and it's being used to hurt President Trump and the Republicans especially with the November elections just stays away [noise] so this guy did it because of what President Trump says that's what they'll have you believe\n[noise]\nAnd because of everything goes wrong is President Trump's fault mark I live in a pain free\nStudio side comes to the U.S I mean don't you think three ... dot com swimming I think eight eight eight nine seven one say [noise]\nI\nHi Mark a this Mark I'm what you were bringing up about a media is absolutely true\nThey don't want to report the fact that this is a cycle and here's a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida light power and I I don't know some other up for it too so what Trump responsible for though no\nHe happens to be just you know the ... the bill ... now and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up or the worst you said a few times during his is a a\nA not his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times that oh yeah go ahead you're on the face or something like that that was that but he hasn't said anything like that where the the left whether it's the actual a political people or the the news\nOr they've all actually said that are going out and confront them and and and and and run 'em out of the stores all this other stuff so um again that's the part of the contracts and different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know during the\nCabinet who this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that [laughter]\nOh of course it's the the the ultimate double standard that uh everyone recognizes that except them well do they recognize it but they're not going to say and even most of the hard core\nI Would say you know a intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are\nActually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something there that what if the Trump arrangements so now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it does you know that's what they would say no question about it breaking ATF news just recently the U.S department of education announced that\nActing on a complaint filed by alliance defending freedom against the Decatur, Georgia city schools is opening an investigation into a horrible assault has a kindergarten kindergarten her in her school bathroom as a result of avoid being allowed and the girls restroom due to the school districts transgender

some in trouble right\nMore after back with you again filling in for Larry I've done a lot of this over the years including at our former station and it's always a privilege to keep in touch with me

touch we mark I search today well dot com and check on my website and see where a filling besides hilarity or Dennis\nSo the Dodgers were playing Washington I write and I and I always rooted against\nI'm originally from Brooklyn and they let me and when people here that they go\nWith you left Brooklyn too\n\nI was a little kid but they did do that to us [noise] All right we're taking your calls at\nEighty eight nine seven on stage and for those are just joining us the first hour we were talking about the bombs and the uh the accused and we didn't mention his name that's important so they don't get that kind of publicity if that's what they're seeking\nBut after we did that and said that how outrageous that was an we acknowledge that\nWe got into the idea that the press obviously wants to blame President Trump for everything and anything everything is his fault that goes wrong and everything that goes right President Obama as you heard we'd like to take credit we we played a clip of in a minute or two of them in the last hour\nAnd it was hard for me to take because I forgot what he did all the time which is he would set up strong dummies and then tear down like you said in the clip we have that to you know we want to rip babies away from the arms of immigrants\nNo they're illegal immigrants and we don't want to risk babies away was your policy by the way Mr former president\nYou know we didn't change that policy needs to be changed obviously but it was your policy in the first place\nAnd we don't want to rip babies away in fact the real answer is don't come here in the first place if you're going to come illegally come here legally and there'll be no issue and who knows who setting up this caravan who's paying for all of it how they're getting here I've heard all kinds of rumors but the fact is\nHe's got to stop them it's an invasion you can't allow this to happen so we followed by others but again he can't do anything right and of course the things he says\nAre the reasons that the suspect in custody did what he did it because of President Trump\nBut then we evolved into the point\nThat you know why they hate them so much among other reasons because he's the first Republican that I can remember in years who's standing up to their nonsense who's willing to call it like it is it's reasonable to ask as I mentioned last our weather's delivery should be indicted for what she did she committed crimes\nAnd when I was sympathetic to her eye on another station another network people get annoyed with me because I said if they agreed to leave the scene forever maybe we could agree not to indict Hillary and people said she's not above the law that's reasonable arguments that is what they see lock her up\nThat is not violent that is just following the rules and principles that we all in this country are subject to the country what is so radical about that\nYeah but but yet when President Trump says it it's absolutely outrageous\nAnd what else I Can't even remember what else they pick on him for what was the other issues besides lock her up that they say Trump uh keeps inciting the audience when I think of it I'll let you know but whenever he says it's it's ... it's just terrible right for the press because the press the fake pressing the fake press\nDo you mean the people the enemy the people if they're not going to do objective journalism because they have tremendous power\nAnd the year is taking the if you American people can't get the news and an object to wait I never knew when I was growing up with the politics was\nOf the journalists who are reporting it that's not true now their gender so clear he's right to call them out on it\nBut I think this is insanity when when the Obama could be outraged sent in theory the rest of us and say things like you'll keep your doctor and you'll keep your health care and uh you know we're we're ... we we care about race of people on our side and we judge people by the color of their skin numbered don't legal\nI've often said give me nine black women on the Supreme Court court conservative and I'm happy camper know where the guy said always see race\nAnd gender and uh you know sexual orientation we don't talk that way we see individuals much more as Dennis and Larry always talk about we see people as people you were the guys that do this kind of stuff\nAll right let me know what you think and we'll take your calls at eight and eight nine seven one stage and here I have an article Sean just gave me journalists accuse Trump of inciting violence against the press I mean I I I don't even want to read the article now 'cause it's\nToo upsetting you guys have created this in the media because you haven't been fair\nLet me know what you think well let's go to um I think we're going to Angus is is it angers I don't see the name of al ... there's a town called I'm stuck to Syria though oh You're welcome to the uh welcome to the ... to show\nHow are you there okay we'll put out on hold and\nOkay and let's go to George in Hollywood, California Georgia Iran with mark [noise]\nYeah [noise] Well Mark you know as a retired job a mental health professional I just have to say that the uh one time media has finally revealed itself in its severe site coast\nAnd I'm at this point uh the media end of this a bomber individual both have some very prominent features of paranoid schizophrenia\nAnd I'd start with these ah [noise]\nA media a nuts are saying oh that Trump is responsible for all of this a bomber stuff and he's responsible for the bombs well you know\nThat's not only mind reading but it's thought insertion they believe that Trump has inserted thoughts into the bombers mind for him to go do it\nAnd the bomber of course well uh you know it's Fox Broadcasting and\nHe's having a conversation with Trump service television or maybe he looks out a picture of him in the paper and he said oh we're so I get the water or tell me what hardware store do I get the pipe that uh what about this other stuff well the reality\nIs is that individuals are responsible for their own behavior and speech just moves air\nAnd people their motivations belong to them and what they do is their responsibility\nAnd speeches protected for the president just as it is for everybody else\nAnd just like we've been talking we didn't blame a Bernie Sanders for what that guy uh with that a phony or you know Chinese a cave rifle dude in nearly killing Steve\nA school lease and um [noise] the other people that were out there with the baseball but the thing of it is is that um\nYou know moving air with speech is one thing but behavior moved physical objects and those things can either be helpful like somebody building a building\nMaking sandwiches are cooking a meal for someone can be harmful catch you let me know what you're saying\nSkate eight nine seven on stage I Want to talk about the article journalists accused Trump of inciting violence

the church uh the video surveillance system called that\nHe was unsuccessful in gaining access to the church\n[noise] well that that's a very sad story and uh [noise] we'll ... we'll follow it a little bit more of a just a curve or shooting suspect tried to enter a black church before killing to look we're crazies out there they're rich so they're not ... none of us are denying that\nWhat we have a problem with is a whole group of people are accused of that like you know Republicans are evil and we're ... and ... that's the problem we there we know they're not like the the guys up the pipe bombs we understand that but we're all guilty of that\nBecause of it we we don't take responsibility for\nPresident Trump hasn't done anything outraged look he's not a perfect package he doesn't always say what I wanted to say but he's standing up to the other side which hasn't happened before and that's why you have the reporters are filling out that the a document with two hundred people

with the press we had a problem with the media it it's been so obvious to so many years and as I said this is the first president to call them on it\nAnd they can't take it they can accept that how dare you challenge them and one can't just ignore\nThis because when the left and the Democrats and\nUh even some liberals when they're not on us to there is a former cause\nThey can't accept us fighting back there all the same they're all the same in the sense they've always had a meeting on their side and you also amazing it's amazing we went in the elections because when you have the media
