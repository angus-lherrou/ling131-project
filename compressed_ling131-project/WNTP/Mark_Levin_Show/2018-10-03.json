hear will effect the dotcom studio next segment and talked to attorney Larry claiming claiming the founder of dish will watch [noise] I think he represents virtually every one of\nThe accusers of Bill Clinton except for one [noise] she conducted a number of deposition [noise] and he knows all about the role that George Clinton was played in helping to orchestrate the so called nuts or slug strategy\nThat was used to malign women like Jennifer Flowers was called a saloon singer Paula Jones drag hundred dollar through a trailer park no telling what you're going to get [noise]\nWe need to\nBroderick to alleges she was raped by Bill Clinton and two weeks after the alleged rape [noise] was threatened by Hillary [noise] we're going to talk to Larry claiming about the role that Mr Clinton not let's play because of the\nSanctimonious way he interviewed Sarah Sanders and Sarah Sanders had the grace not to bring up his behavior during the Clinton years\nLet him tell his side of the story before we allow allegation to determine his entire\nFeature seen though that the president has already reached a judgment about their stories and there does seem to be a pattern here when Roy Moore is accused from Bill O'Reilly is accused when Roger ales is accused when Rob Porter is accused and that one by Kevin ... is the president consistently every single time takes the side of the man you\nKnow it's interesting that you say that it's on a lot of Democrats that like to ignore Keith Ellison and Cory Booker they love to fight and champion women until they disagree with the how Frank and lost his job in the Senate fat\nAs I said Sara had too much class to mention Mr putting up the behavior back in Nineteen Ninety two let's revisit\nThey'll go to the Clinton has a character problem but I take it that you're allowed to play and has no Caroline I'm In Colorado has its own well let me think it is because not denied that he is engaged in Myrtle infidelity is not as as soon as he had problems and is that right and he uh he was talked about the draft and to some people it's a character brother\nBill Clinton's passes character test throughout his life and throughout this campaign and he's two senators commitments to real fights and what he's doing this campaign is focused on the court and the American people on the jobs and the education that's what the American people care about they want to move into the future they don't want to be diverted by fight issues they're not going to let the Republican attack machine divert\nThat was then and this is now ... and\nA number of other Democrats should have that same type of sprint they look the president is actually my question\nEvery single time the president is taking the side of the man against women it's accusers that's\nNot trip isn't that an amazingly annoying can we go back again Nineteen Ninety two George Clinton apple is what his name to just I can send your facts with names addresses phone numbers of an affair with this is from the documentary war room he's talking to a reporter who's calling him about an allegation that Bill Clinton had an affair [noise] it wouldn't\nMake a truce get is completely [noise] if he went on the radio\nAnd said the bill Clinton is the heart of allergens like child he would be laughed at what they get crazy I guarantee you that if you do this like you never worked in that way obviously that\nNow you're talking to a reporter and you're saying if you report this you'll never worked in democratic politics again what is a reporter doing working in democratic politics you're\nCrazy I guarantee you that if you do this in other words and that was back then\nSo you were threatening the people that do what you do right now isn't it ironic\n[noise] maybe don't want to or not they are matters you will be embarrassing for the national park people will think throwing 'em like they don't really believe here\nThis is again George Clinton was Nineteen Ninety two threatening a reporter who had apparently a story on Bill Clinton Governor Bill Clinton\nAnd people think is\nThe alternative is they don't do it that causes for temporary and people who tomorrow I can a matter of fact and you have a campaign to understand in a difficult time did something right\n\nAnd that was then this is now and in this case the president knows Brett Kavanaugh he's heard his story there hasn't been a shred of evidence to corroborate the other individual stories and there has been a lot of individuals that have come forward and talked about that Brett Kavanaugh that they know a\nAnd they're confident that these things that happened final question what is the president says All right\nJulie sweating it gives the one who claim she observed Kevin are participating in a gang rape or being near a gang rape or she said she herself so she was victimized but can't say whether or not or Kevin I was one of those who assaulted her\nCan you tell me what happened what genes are comfortable telling us what\nHappened to me is probably the most horrendous awful thing that could happen any day my body was violated [noise]\nMy soul is broken or I Would not able to have somebody stop when I said no stop [noise] you know I felt like somebody took me and basically said you're worth less than\nAnyone nothing pat who are disposable I was at a party and I remember that I started not to feel very well and next thing I Know I was shoved into a room and I'm having my clothes\nTorn different direction with um [noise] I was touched everywhere or I was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assault Taiwan then it was horrible I had no way to fend them off\nThey know what I'm going to ask everyone is wondering if one of those coupons but I\nCannot specifically say that he was one\nUh was caught by the judge or not telling the truth and at that time Sam Donaldson who was his co host\nOn ABC's This week called me up and he asked me about the monopoly is whether he had been found to have lived and I said ... how could you leave this guy on the air when he's now a certified liar and of course now you know the multi millionaire he's riding high ABC\nAnd now he feels a duty bound to take a shot at the president simply because he defended judge Kavanaugh\nLarry claiming a you said you had a step Annapolis under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim you've done\nWell I had a very good memory [laughter] you know the the favorite\nPhrase of the Clinton people was\nI had no specific regular recollection means I remember something I Can't remember now on the front of the ... bar justice so no he wouldn't have the right thing and like I said he he was found to live under those\nWell given the fact that he won't admit to anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nThat's been widely reported him and re no because actually ... you wrote a book called the war room which became a documentary\nWhere in that book he admitted to working recovery courtroom to address\nFalse allegations by your accusers right Bill Clinton's accuses the women that I represented now ironically Laurie in today's world would convert the elected judges erotic patrol denying an allegation is enough to say that you think someone in fact the correct It's got to lawsuits right now because he denied\nThat he sexually harassed any women he's probably let this judge allowed to go for her forward in time to change and we now are and what could affect the civil war between left and right and these judges are furthering the civil war\nLarry claiming as the founder judicial watching freedom watch a wary eye was having a conversation the other day with a buddy of mine is about my age\nAnd he said he told a friend of yours about\nGeorge Stephanopoulos role in the mining these women she ... the the friend is also a middle aged unaware that Stephanopoulos even worked for Bill Clinton let alone that he was involved in orchestrating these strategy that was later on called the nuts are slept strategy unaware of it so if this guy's a middle aged guys unaware but imagine with people in their forties thirties twenties\nThink of George Stephanopoulos they have no idea he was involved no connection whatsoever\nNo they don't and I might add Gennifer Flowers actually brought a lawsuit against Stephanopoulos along with a little recording and then James Carville was in the district or their data or many years ago twenty ... twenty five years later he was\nOver our river allegations see a doctor to tape which she didn't Bill Clinton with her admitting to an affair and that got a lot of news for

taxes\nQuote protected by a labyrinth of trust as well as tax strategy that would make jokes at the Kennedy proud the candy for Janelle spans approximately thirty family members including the surname Shriver all offered and Smith\nThe bulk of the family's wealth is held in dozens of trust which range and value from tens of thousands too much at twenty five million nearly all are managed by Joseph

which are passing air to air for decades if not longer the candy families largely insulated from the\nEstate tax handled correctly a dynasty trust could potentially maintain and on taxable fortune indefinitely the oldest Kennedy trust on record dates back to Nineteen thirty six\nAnd then they talk about the sale of the family's most valuable asset the iconic merchant my merchandise marches in

value of the sale\nThe secret sauce however is accepting partnership unit in lieu of cash to first\nCapital gains tax\nIf the partnership units are placed in trust capital gains taxes could potentially be deferred for ever end of quote\nWhen one of the Kennedy family members who and handles this trust was contacted Christopher Kennedy said and I'm quoting we are a very public family with

about it but whatever they did critic other loopholes that other tax lawyers are driving Arnold Schwarzenegger's\nHummer through did the president\nOr his father engage in illegal\nTax fraud or did they simply hire very shrewd people to minimize their tax liability the way virtually everybody does including John Kerry\nWho say five hundred thousand dollars from his yacht by arguing that he's more and get in Rhode Island even though he really hasn't in Massachusetts because Rhode Island doesn't have the same amount of taxes did the president\nOr his father engage in anything illegal or talk to an expert about that when I come back also the vote on Brett Kavanaugh maybe this week and the FBI report could come out any moment now I Am Larry Elder do not\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove mhm so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure\nUm suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars or the purchase price now\nWhat does that work to me what is that included in my network if I if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the gift be or the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that mortgage and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thoughts\nIt's an eight when everybody lost value in the real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars and like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children mhm so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nI give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return\nWatch four hundred and twenty thousand dollars might not say four hundred thousand dollar mortgage that's twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later there's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes and I sell my children sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they keep\nThree hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they get three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say that they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift\nBut you see that was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain leverage of real estate and so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something and then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was when it was given\nFree of charge recharge is my guest season attacking estate planning lawyer or read you said there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and if they could be proven to be true it would be

bad shape a foot you know just ... drowning in debt\nThat apparently his father or sent an emissary to buy three million dollars worth of chip\nRead them and put you on hold for for ... for for this

there until the fall of sixty nine so we did we were not contemporary\n... when you read the New York times article did anything occur to you they gave you an idea of what to do or what not to do it did anything pop up where you said wow I never thought of that or it well that's a bad idea\nNo I mean ... the the article does talk about the most important part of their\nA movement of wealth downstream wants to\nDo things to the value the gifts because our gift in a state taxes are what we used to call in Latin class at the lower them they're based upon the value at the date of death or in the case of gifted on a date of the gift [noise]\nAnd so there are techniques which are used to diminish the value of the of the gifts so for example\nIf I were to give you a twenty percent uh ownership of my house just to be for me to Larry Elder over twenty percent interest\nBut instead I buy that that's one value twenty percent of whatever the value is because in California we have the ability to pursue to sell the property if you worry partial owner fractional interest on the other hand if I put it into a partnership or limited liability company the whole property\nAnd in that in a year or organizing documented says nobody can partition this and read is the only person who can make decisions about the property\nThen you have in your twenty percent you cannot sell it\nAnd you cannot a manager so I have the management control and I have the ownership control and that diminishes your twenty percent so if you went out and tried to show your twenty percent interest in our partnership\nIt would be far less than twenty percent of the underlying real property so I just diminished the value that has been accepted by the IRS and the courts and the only thing that the IRS argues with practitioners like me is what is the discount that has allowed\nVery commonly it's twenty or thirty percent that's a kind of a safe harbor these days\n... we have just one minute left of
