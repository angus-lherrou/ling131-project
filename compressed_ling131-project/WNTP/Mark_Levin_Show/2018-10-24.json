A. G. E. triple eight nine seven one Seventy two for three very older relief Becker dot com studio we've been talking about this and migrant caravan that according to a Mexican newspaper has now reached fourteen thousand people in the Van Jones CNN\nI think it's much more likely that Donald Trump is paying for this them for ... can be paying for it doesn't exactly the worst kind of thing they'd be happening or in a moment like this because what it does is it gives a now they're talking point Donald Trump look at these invading hordes et cetera so I Do want to say one thing\nJust because someone is Middle Eastern of course there are no Middle Eastern people there\nBut that doesn't mean that there are bad it doesn't mean they're terrorists how do you know that\nWe were in this world now where Trump can say Middle Eastern and everybody then immediately somehow begin to think of terrorists of most of the terrorists that we are as we've had the United states are not being committed by Middle Eastern people by Muslims there being committed by right wing extremists in our own country but I just didn't lie on top of lie on top ally\nUp in lives and then with my life I mean on top of it so we should just let fourteen thousand people come here\nAnd saw tennis fourteen thousand more want to come they can come to\nThis is outrageous\nWhat country would put up with this with Mexico put up with a caravan of fourteen thousand Guatemala trying to get into their country are you kidding me\nNow calling to the Washington Post\nCoke for now Mexican police have merely stepped aside as a caravan his past watching first as migrants took raft across the river to separate the country from Guatemala and then as it continued by foot along the main highway chanting thief a poodle or yes we did get\n\nThe Washington Post continues the response appears to have that respond to appear to have been conveyed to the White House and now once again Mexico's most important bilateral relationship appears to be on shaky ground no kidding [noise]\nTrump tweeted sadly it looked like Mexico's police and military are able to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states\nLater on he said on Fox News I don't know what's going on with Mexico it looks like people are walking right through the middle of Mexico I'm not exactly thrilled they're either end of quote\nThe government said they were going to do something about it but according to the Washington Post called riot police have stopped to pose for pictures in their gear as if ready to combat the migrants letting international TV crews filmed them before retreating\nAnd letting the caravan pass through undeterred\nTrump refer to himself as a nationalist and today in the in the oval office he clarified\nVideos\nYou\nWe're going to say that\nMy love our country and our country has taken set the second federal if you look at the trade deals and nobody knows are better than me\nI'm knocking out some of the worst deals I've ever seen and what we're giving all of our wealth all of our money to other countries and then they don't treat us properly where we're protecting other rich countries is very very rich countries including by the way a country that happens to be very much in that it was Saudi Arabia\nAnd mentally wealthy and we're taking care of the military for a fraction of the fall is not fair to the U.S other countries also immensely wealthy countries\nAs we have to get reimbursed for that we should not be the world's police keeper and I'd get reimbursed and by the way when I bring up to the heads of countries like Japan\nPrime minister I'll be a friend of mine I bring it up he looks at me and he goes I understand they understand that nobody has ever asked them for what I said have you ever asked I said have you ever been asked like [noise]\nYou have to be kept out [noise] nobody's ever asked so that's a pretty unfair thing I'll get back to you again factors wait wait wait wait\nPresident said all I Want is for our country to be treated with respect that's what he means who she knew she was do we know he's a white nationalist that's the bones thrown to the races except\nMaybe is for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist\nBefore a couple of seconds I should have a pretty good report very said yes I\nWas just fall under um is\nThere is the ... language for your dog whistle sooner and are there that would really be\nThere is a concern that you're sitting recorded message a dog whistle out there there is concern passionate voice you mean that's what you think he's doing this\nI never even heard that I cannot imagine that you mean I I'm a naturalist I never heard that theory about big on national is I've heard them all but I'm somebody that loves our country when I say a national as I don't like it when Germany Spain one percent of GDP report of courses Jim Acosta\nFor NATO and we're paying for point three percent I don't like that that's not fair I don't like it wasn't as an example we're protecting a\nHero and we're paying for almost the entire cost of the day that we're paying for a very very substantial portion far\nGreater than what it should be a we have great respect\nFor those guys but on top of that I don't like it when they put up barriers to farmers were farmers cannot sell into Europe they have trade barriers that make you guys know is better than anybody say on trade barriers that or as severe\nAs China's trade barriers which really coming down they want to make a deal very badly there'll be coming down [noise]\nBut I Am very proud of our country and we cannot continue to allow what's happened to our country to continue to have one can't let it happen so I'm proud and I'm proud of our country that I Am a nationalist is a war that hasn't been used too much\nSome people use it but I'm very proud I think it should be brought back my somebody that wants to help other countries of the world\nBut I also have to take it to take care of our country we cannot continue to allow ourselves to be due to the military and also dumped on trade with the European Union as an example\nLast year on trade with the last one hundred and fifty one million dollars on top of that we lost hundreds of billions of dollars on protection and so we protect\nAnd we get killed ... do the training and they get killed you can't do it I Want it to be fair and so I Want them to open their borders I Want them to make it fair for our farmers are are companies now are medical companies they sell medical equipment they just put restrictions on\nWe're and a half ago with a medical equipment can get into Europe even though it's better than what they are [noise] so they have to treat as well all I Want our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of ours\nSo called allies and they have not treated with our country fairly so in that sense I Am absolutely a national is that I'm proud of it for us for that um this\nLast night in Texas [laughter] and if Trump referred to Maxine Waters\nAliens in

able to listen wherever you might be\nYou're gonna want to hear that conversation also I've got conversation scheduled for the broadcast a today slashed tonight uh with some pretty important in a press if people are ... listen I sat him more shoo shoo it on his Salem Radio show this morning\nSo I did his program and as part of that regular schedule um I got an opportunity to speak with and MSNBC liberal anchor slash host uh by the name is Stephanie rural you probably know about her you've probably heard clips played from her and all of her\nI got a chance to talk to her to say that it was\nMm entertaining\nI think was an understatement enough so that I feel like replaying it for you it's only about five minutes long that's how much time they have on the morning drop clock but I Want you to hear from stepping in rural just to get a feel for what the liberal point of view is as it pertains to President Trump and his supporters headed into these midterm elections\nBecause the president can't say anything without the liberals adding words to his statements in order to make them sound offensive\nAnd you know exactly what I'm Talking about the left going crazy about the president two nights ago\nSpeaking in Houston, Texas on behalf of Senator Ted Cruz at a sold out Toyota sold out packed jam packed Toyotas center with thousands of more people outside\nThe president declared he's a nationalist that is a dog whistle we're told that is an absolute state minutes of color code coded language to the base saying I'm with you white supremacist wow and what\nYeah I'm going to talk about that we're going to talk of the play back for you\nThe conversation that I had with Stephanie rural well is it going to talk about what nationalism really means with where he has some ah who is a very impressive person he was a a close senior advisor national barrage when uh the Brexit was decided\nAh we're in England or in Europe rather a when Great Britain decided to essentially remove itself from\nUh do you and you know what that is that as an actor of\nNationalism we're going to talk to ... to ... uh and then also as it pertains to the ongoing and ever marching inexorably\nToward the southern border of the United states the northern border of Mexico that Central American caravan now believed to be some fourteen thousand strong\nAh what does it mean for the United states and what can we do to stop\nWhat I think most of us would agree is an invasion is not a migration it is an invasion RJ home and is the director of governmental affairs for fair the federation for American immigration reform so that that coming up next to ours are also a lot of really good people would have thought too including ... ... ... a replay\nStepping rural from a conversation that I've had with her earlier today\nBut the lead story of course we have to get into is who is sending explosive well potentially\nExplosive devices to prominent Democrats in New York it in Washington DC the homes of George Soros the Clintons Brock Obama and others apparently have been targeted for these suspicious packages let's get a little check your of the news on this from Fox\nBy the latest tally six packages were confirmed threat three in New York at the home of billionaire George Soros on Monday and today it's CNN and one address to the home of bill and Hillary Clinton in ... for which Mrs Clinton at a campaign stop in Florida thanked Secret Service who intercepted\nAnd dress she last long before it made its way into our homes\nAnother was addressed to the Obamas in Washington and also to Florida in Maryland for Democrats five packages were cleared three in California and one received by New York's governor\nSo this of course all happening less than two weeks before the midterm elections and uh right now as you can imagine the finger of blame is being pointed\nIt's being pointed by the American left by which I mean elected Democrats\nMembers of Democrat activist groups members of the DNC and members of the Democratic controlled media which is to say virtually all media that isn't conservative talk radio when maybe that Fox News report\nThe finger of blame is being poured it squarely at Donald Trump and Donald Trump's psychotic supporters\n[noise]\nIt is um an astounding thing uh hypocrisy when you see and hear these kinds of things\nWhen\nSteve skull lease was nearly murdered on a baseball field\nNot too terribly long to do what Eighteen months ago someone that neighbor when Steve ... was nearly murdered and when an entire softball field or a baseball field\nFull of Republican elected officials congressional members practicing for baseball game were attacked by what we came to find out to be a radical extremist Bernie Sanders socialist who wanted to murder as many Republicans as possible\nDo you recall what the Democrats said\nDo not point the finger of blame at Democrats for these psychotic actions of somebody who happened to support one of us\n\nCan't put blood on our hands because one not we didn't tell him to do that we didn't tell him\nTo to try to murder people that's not on us right this is what they said very loudly very clearly in very repeatedly\nNow those very same Democrats who said you can't blame 'em his politics for his decision to try to commit mass murder on Republican members of Congress on a baseball field\nYou can't blame his politics are now saying you must blame the politics of people we don't even know\nWe have no earthly idea at this point in time\nWho sent delivered made fabricated or whatever any of these could be would be might be potentially explosive devices and sent them to Soros CNN the Clintons and the Obamas\nWe have no idea but with I don't know who it is\nThey are ready to say it's Trump's fault\nAnd its Trump supporters fault because President Trump doesn't like the media President Trump demonize is the media especially CNN and therefore his followers are carrying out what he wants to have done to them\nThat is exactly what they're spending their time doing meanwhile there are others myself included\nAsking for at least a modicum of patients asking for just an idea\nJust give us at least a hint of an idea of who this is before we start describing motive and blame because there are a lot of people whose to suspect that this close to the mid term elections that this is a false flag and these are things being done by liberals to try to embarrass and to try to hold with\nConservatives and Trump supporters accountable for this we have lots of digest year we want you to be a part of the show tripling nine seven ... seven more than seven two or three friends in foreign Larry Elder of ceremonial\nTo know about our country so\nGo\n[noise] president of\nThe United states could not have been more clear in defining what he meant\nHe said between globalism which is being more\nCertain about the people of the globe then you are about the people in your own country versus nationalism which is putting our people first the people that elected me and then I'll deal with the rest of the globe second between those two I'm a nationalist\nThat is exactly what President Trump said and what did the left here well Jim Acosta tells you what\nThe left her there's pros and just to follow up on your comments about being a

nationalist he made it very clear\nThat this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree given the president's history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history\nI prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go into an election where he is capitalizing on ... so we're going to agree to that ...\nWell yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not cause it sounds like what you're doing stuff and I\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many accredited and has said over the years and it's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes you feel so uncomfortable as a matter of you know your your expertise is is largely an economics you're you're you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway you know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or ah nationalism in globalism\nIn were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're gonna stop other countries from taking advantage of the United states if I have to use terrorists if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better deal out of the market is that now is not not economic nationalism but is that\nNot economic nationalism backlash [noise] not if you look at the way the president is conducting themselves to give you the truth is that an impact he would engage and things like ... and partner with our allies that have been kept saying\nSeventy rule thank you for coming on your first year that she is on our Sunday that live at the top of that music can\nBe on there of course was uh the end of the top of a interview that I did with a Seventy role this morning so that was a replay of this morning's conversation that I had there and I'm waiting for that to and um but what I Want to get to and I want you to respond to is this an eight eight eight nine seven\nOn stage um she said she's not putting words in the president's mouth\nBut she is doing exactly that she is saying that the president is talking about white nationalism the president said globalism nationalism global just put the world first in our country second nationals put our country first than the rest of the world's second I'm a nationalist she and Jim Acosta are saying\nThis rather than just a follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white national I've never\nI mean that's if that's not putting words into somebody's mouth for the purpose of trying to tear them down\nThen nothing is he literally said why did you skip the word why don't you mean white nationalist he stuck to the stuff that word in his mouth I asked up and he wrote about it and she said no we're not putting words in his mouth that's just what he meant because he's been dog whistling and using coded language from the very beginning\nFor goodness sakes the president of the United states\nHas set on numerous occasions I was not elected president of the world I was elected president of the United states it's my job to serve the people who elected me they are first I Want to give one great example that I cannot take credit for\nOne great example I think this is just the perfect analogy alright\nOn Twitter this morning when I brought this up and I had the conversation with Stephanie rule [noise]\nSomebody tweeted to me and you can do so as well as France radio F. R. A. N. T. Z. somebody tweeted to me and said you know when the airline attendant tells you to put the oxygen mask on yourself first on your children second there is a reason for that because you are no good to your child if your past out\nThat's nationalism\nIf we don't take care of ourselves in the United states first we are no good to anybody else around the world that is economic nationalism that is military nationalism that is taking care of yourself first and then being able to help others the president is right\nYour reaction please eight eight eight nine seven months age coming right back\nBob brand simple aerial during the ... radio network you're listening to the Larry Elder show [noise]\nUsed or nine Ninety [noise]\nWant to say something about release factor you know eighty percent of the people who've tried to release factor quick start by it again it would not\nHappen if the stuff didn't work\nNow you're already taken care of your body so you can take care of your family give your body the essential nutrients that need to help fight the pain for example Stephanie from Florida I have my own business it requires a lot of muscle work\nI've always been concerned about painkillers messing up my liver when I heard about relief factor I decided to give it a try because it's natural now I'm able to get through my day with minimal pain versus before when I had to be almost in tears coming home and I couldn't do anything but lay down and wait for the pain to subside\nMy pain you take control of my life but now I Am in ...\nWhy don't you try the three week quick start Nineteen dollars and Ninety five cents that works out to Ninety five cents a day for pain relief lets a cup of coffee a day just going to release factor dot com relief factor dot com that's released factor dot com\nAnd I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan either healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical bills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollar Medicare members shared\nAll our bells and it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without ... sure\nIt's worth looking into there is the reason is is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nAid for for forty one Bible that aid for for for one B.

I guess you just quickly as I can at eight eight eight nine seven on stage that Tripoli nine seven one seven to for three but I Want to have a conversation now a with a good friend\nWho has a new book out and ah who is pulling no punches he does not pull punches in his writing\nHe does not pull punches when he writes columns for\nA town hall ... he's the senior columnist there and he does not pull

... said let's do this thing to have you back my man how are you [noise]\nHey Matt great to be here\nMan I I there's so much ground to cover I Would like to do the plus injuries and everything else I Want to talk about your book but I Want to talk about all of these issues going on Tucson diving right in do you buy\nThe right wing pipe bomb conspiracy or with all of these things being center Soros Obama's Clinton's and CNN because China weeks two weeks before the election Kurt I Do not buy it for one second I smell false flags being plan to go ahead\nI think it is more likely than not not a right wing conservative outlier doing this look a it is one of three things in the right wing conservative outlier it is a nut who was a political and just wacky\nOr it is a someone uh allied with a lap attempting to do exactly what's happening now which is a conservative suburb violent Bob guys um\nIf you look at the evidence but we are constantly told how a random shooters are going to turn out to be you know and are a Christian you know up against and they never are never are we know that are Democrats have been urging violence and a ... attack ... we know\nThat the law has a history of bombings just look at the Nineteen sixties and seventies indisputable\nUh that they did it all it's also indisputable that we did see a nearly endless series of hoaxes mostly hate crime hoaxes on campus as an adult\nWhere someone did something horrible y'all idea swastika or new or something and it turned out to be the very same a a social justice warrior victims\nAre trying to create a pressure\nI don't know the answer you don't know the answer but I Will tell you this I Am not going to allow the leap\nTo tell me that I Can't look at the facts and fake this is a viable possibility I were to blame Donald Trump and sixty three decent Americans who are built this country feed it you'll end up ...\nA a face on the the the the the the sketchy narrative I think what we call it we'll live\nKirk the president came out just or to today rather and did what a president should do so did the vice president and by the way and they called for an end to this they called for civility they called for a no more violence\nHe said very clearly quote in these times we have to unify we have to come together in some one very clear strong unmistakable message\nThat acts or threats of political punch up anytime\nHave no place in the United states of America what I was absolutely true\nThat we thought of course it's true but but but hold on ... this is what I wasn't really react to\nThe response to that from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority minority leader Nancy Pelosi was to rip President Trump suggesting that he didn't mean it saying quote from President Trump's words ring hollow until we were versus his statements that condone acts of violence I think well this in a statement perks\nThe party that actually has Maxine Waters and Cory Booker and Hillary Clinton and countless others out they're calling for acts of violence and instability in the public forum they're the ones saying that if Trump and the Republicans who are responsible for violence got\nWhat they are ... are they are blind and stupid because they missed the ... and gosh I've only someone wrote a book called militant normal available on Amazon about this very subject they think we're stupid\nThey think we're stupid because Democrats are used to dealing with stupid people that is the rank and file Democrats [noise]\nIt's not going to work this is going to have the same effect as they thought Kevin always a great idea let's track this guy and a drink beer and you know had fun in high school which crash um and the ... that destroyed their blew away\nHis is another example of a situation that they laid it like sensible adults could only benefit them politically but they will not do it they will apply to bigotry and prejudices against normal Americans and\nTry and paid ... ... ...\nAs some sort of a set of violence psychopaths\nAnd normal Americans are going to say that's just not true you know whoever did this clearly needs to go jail whether it's a right wing outlier a yacht or maybe needs to go that not house or a leftist trying to uh disrupted um\nAnd there is not a single conservative out there who condones this violence there is not one\nSchool up here I heard that that's that's a big part of this because\nThe the moment even when Nancy Pelosi got shouted down by a bunch of people calling or communist just a few days ago kind of echoing and Mary ... there's been done to Ted Cruz and and and Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and ...\nUp immediately conservative condemn condemn condemn cannot you can't do that stopped that nonsense we don't like it when it's done to us do not do it to them this is bull crap we're better than that\nNow this uh these these ... you know explosive devices potentially we don't even know by the way right now what they are or or where they came for all we do know immediately we condemn condemned can never give up when the left is doing all of these things Kurt over and over and over again when these leftist mobs antifa et cetera et cetera et cetera are carrying out these acts\nI'm Still waiting for the first word of hey don't do that from anybody in a in a position of authority on the American left none\nBut when you won't you won't see it because they're not against it there for\n... they're there for ... that that's the difference in the normal people that they've got about had about good six eight hours of this\nWhere where they could have taken the high road and maybe maybe scored some political points that's a political season or or political points but one second day of overplay their hand\nBecause they hate us normal people so much they don't even bother to try and understand where we made me coming from so that they might be able to craft a message that appeals to us instead they say you know Trump's encouraging violence and they look at Trump and he's not encourage pilots and they look at themselves\nAnd they're not racist sexes hate filled and they don't like buying less\nUh and they didn't like it when as normal Americans do they went overseas and defended their country\nThey are immediately said this is more Democrat below me\nAnd you know they are not going to discount the possibility this is from a too clever by ...\nCrying by sending you know bombs in the early don't work very well and uh uh to people who ... who they know we're going to screen them and catch up\nAnd you know that ... that is entirely off and they're not going to discount that possibility and no one's chickens count that possibility the the the truth is what the facts are and\nYou know eventually either this person will never be caught or the secret service and FDR gr grab them and we will find out who this person is and yet know why\nI betcha it's going to be like every other situation where we had one of these where we were told we were responsible from some horrible horrible thing and then they find it some leftist sympathizer\nJumped on all sides in order in order to to make conservatives look bad right before the election ... I got to give out here I didn't ask you about the caravan or more about military normal ... another short segment a new\nSure\nI Would really I think I really appreciate that I Do want to talk to you about the caravan about nationalism andme about military normal the new book by Critchlow author who will continue with us right after this you're listening to the Larry Elder show\nSub [noise] immediately\nYou heard of Jim Acosta jumped up and said wait a minute what did what did what job that's not just the cost of this is\nJust to follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there is that what you really mean is that you're a white nationalist\nI'm no I don't know how you get white nationalist I'm asking less but what I mean honestly it's like he's playing the Google auto fill you started to type in the word last year was do you mean white nationalist and the left has gone crazy ever since occurred make language\nI first of all I Love it when Democrats excites against American to say I love America more than other country and you don't worry too old going into the electric don't let me stop you go right ahead you won't be in that prior\nAnd ask for your really mean white nationalist ... there was a concern in white nationalist okay that's not true there is no concern Mimi among really stupid people but the concern comes from liars\nOkay so you are either an idiot or you or a liar or maybe boat\nYou ... if you're starting there there's no other option because it's demonstrably Paul and one that\nYou know you have a normal Americans do I want you know I I I like America I was in the show I was in the air force for five years you know before I came home and I don't like that hurts day in court but I I I liked America I I'm an American and they're telling me that makes me a racist\nI don't think I'm going to cross with my vote for ... or their wires normal as militant normalcy just\nRegular Americans anyone who's ever so call it brought this up to me and my morning show this morning\nAnd said anybody has ever recited the pledge of allegiance is reciting I'm a nationalist I Am pledging allegiance to this flag of this country not to the un not to the rest of the world to this flag that means this is where my allegiance lies that's nationalism how did that become a dirty word\nFor what I don't know when I when I uh first enlisted and then became an officer in the army and I want to seven years white\nAnd I was not my goal is to defend the United states of America yeah I I work with allies and protected foreign people off because that was in America's interest to do that with what my ... the the electric president ordered me to go and I did it I gladly and proudly\nWhat I did it you know the war on my shoulder with the American why exactly\nThat's what you fought for and that's the country that you represent and that's a country that Donald Trump represents and he made that very clear as I pointed out before when he pulled us out of the Paris climate accord and said I'm worried about the people of Pittsburgh not Paris that's nationalism and that's patriotism the book is militant normal regular Americans are rebelling against the link to reclaim our democracy\nBy pro choice or get it now the militant normal ... thank you my friend\nYou got branches for over we're\nNine Ninety intelligent conservative talk [noise] that's\nOur news I Am the seniors in Washington New York City police commissioner James O'Neill says investigators are reviewing security video and see if they can identify a career believed to have delivered a package\nContaining a pipe bomb to CNN's Manhattan office meals set an appearance on CNN he was pretty sure those images will be caught on video and we'll be able to find out where that person came from packages containing explosives also targeted Hillary Clinton former President Obama and others\nAnd other turn of selling brick Wall Street Wednesday sending the Dow Jones industrial average comedy\nAnd then six hundred points and extending a losing streak for the benchmark at some pay five hundred index to a six day\nThe tech heavy NASDAQ Composite bore the brunt of the sell off leaving it more than ten present below it's August peak what Wall Street calls a correction [noise] this is as are in news oh\nDa di di di whether mostly clear on cold tonight the breeze diminishing load thirty five of the colder suburbs were front than forty one in center city plus the Sunday and cool tomorrow I'm fifty three ... thirty five to forty pretty cool some sun followed by clouds could start to rain lately entertaining like fifty five\nChilies Saturday with rain and the ...
