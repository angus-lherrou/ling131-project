from Texas\nA I've got fresh news here from Texas I was hanging out with my buddy Ted Cruz there's a name drop of a lifetime but it's true out just last night we did a Facebook Live\nBroadcast that you could probably go I'm just at that that that uh but the ... Ted Cruz page on Facebook or the the main without a to point one million followers so that was cold\nAnd it was kind of a sudden because I'll I'll pull back the curtain a little bit and take kind of what happened 'cause ... had a a had a vanity infomercial on CNN last night and doubled down on Trump impeachment that's always a winner in taxes the move\nI'll give you some uh some some view from here on the ground as the saying goes in Texas in by the way that's where I Am and it's great to be back with you spend a little while ago were does unfilled on just about every other us Salem Radio

conversation those magnificent Hillsdale dialogues with Larry aren't so that'll be our number three next hour oh we've got a couple of folks who can't wait to talk to a little poetry action going into the weekend from Tarzan of Joe\nAnd uh at fifty minutes past the our next hour I tried to look at weekend movies with sunny bunch\nThat means I have seen\nIt means I have an hour and forty minutes to figure out exactly how to massage the first man issue [laughter] guess what new sunny and I have in common we both love whew what new study and I have in common we say the first man controversy is ridiculous\nBut then I got to get some said and some ... and this caravan of of folks coming to the border what do you want to do about it one eight hundred five two oh one two three four one eight hundred five two oh one two three four\n... as a human being I care at a baby sees one of God's\nChildren he was brutally murdered and chopped up in a little bit it's terrible\nAs an American how much am I supposed to twist off about this exact believe it is a question I'm asking maybe you're asking yourself to lead to try to cobble some answers together at one eight hundred and five two oh one two three four we have movies coming out this weekend we'll talk about that with sunny but I just I just got to commiserate with my buddy\nBut why be sunny I mean I Love to commiserate with you I I went to I went to war with this uh with my Gallagher because ...\nIt's the knee jerk reaction of of of the decade there is no such thing just times say there's one time and then but I'll pick it up a sunny if necessary there is no such thing\nAs a human being\nWho has seen first plan and thinks the American flag was slighted no such thing\nI'll just leave it at that it is a magnificent film it drips with American achievement I walked out of it as proud to be an American as I've ever been and uh so just if you're sitting here thinking\nYou know global is Hollywood pitiful by the way there's plenty of global is Hollywood ... don't listen if you're looking for ways in which Hollywood dishonor is America if you will not have to look far but don't look at it as a movie because it does not happen is magnificent it is the stuff of Oscars for director Damien ...\nAnd Ryan guys like who is ... and clarify as Mrs Armstrong he is no perfect as Neal\nThat what you're talking about the IRS the main job even bigger than Ted Cruz you're already ten years ago I had a chance to hang with Neil Armstrong I Know how to bad apples [noise] well this gig is helpful and living in this town is out but we have a wonderful I'm\nJule and the crowd of DFW called the frontiers of flight museum and ten years ago we did a fortieth anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo program 'cause obviously if you do the math that means the fiftieth anniversary is now and you are correct about that [noise]\nUh and Apollo seven a crewman won't Cunningham knows a lot of other astronauts on so I'm looking to Neil and buzz and bill Anders from Apollo ... and Alan ... now late Alan Bean walked on the moon Apollo twelve of Fort Worth guy and I\nI I Am seat a panel with all these guys I'm pension myself because believe you me I Am a ... in ... the taste hue and his feelings about the Cleveland Browns that is me and a manned space flight ... which is probably a horribly clumsy analogy but uh but but that that was me I mean I'm sixty right now\nSo in in my pre adolescent years through my adolescent years where all the Apollo missions I Lived with them I Breathe them\nAnd uh it it simply must be a God saying bill where through through a set of circumstances that I scarcely deserve that I was able to meet and hang out and speak with these folks and Neal is very unassuming\nHe was very much the American hero very much uh the the the uh\nThe enthusiastic for his country but he was also very aware that he was representing him and he was representing humanity and it's the thing that made me probably the most nuts about the whole first ma'am controversy it's like we had to pick sides\nIt's either an American achievement or human achievement guys it's both they're not mutually exclusive okay\nEnough about that enough enough enough enough enough [laughter] part of what's the best thing that I can share with you about Ted Cruz and a beta or four months and months and months and months you know maybe not so much lately but for many moons uh oldest stories were pouring out of my state of Texas\nAre close race oh Ted Cruz's in trouble who'd Texas is gonna turn purple on the weight of turning blue oh there's never been a candidate like may Joe\nTed Cruz is running scared every single one of those stories were crap just to use the vernacular\n[noise] ah it was ridiculous it is ridiculous this was never a close race on paper now were there a couple of polls that there was one that had a beta was like a one or two point lead\nWell we know the kind of recent history that polling organizations have had no don't wait but in fairness to that industry polls are a snapshot of enthusiasm of the ... that are taken in the blink of an eye\nSo if you go back when was that ... by one or two a\nAnd a half ago company or something like that ... August September and it's possible that I did a survey with or any of the sample size of acts might have run into a vein of democratic enthusiasm because let me tell you\nDemocrat enthusiasm in my state is higher than it has been in a long time now what does that mean what does that mean it means that Ted Cruz is not going to beat ... by sixteen points as he did Paul Sadler six years ago to get to the Senate it's not going to be a sixteen point when\nIn fact it could be ... as much as ten points closer\nI Believe that the ... and it's kind of a wide range but hey it's an election who knows these days [noise] predicting is a very sketchy game I consider the range of possibilities\nFor the Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke race when we wake up on November seventh or go to bed really late [laughter] it's been my gaze on the sex I Believe the range of possibility is Ted Cruz winning by four to Ted Cruz winning by twelve\nAt eight points but hey I ... if if he wins by for that means that Cruz voters were lazy it means that Texas Republicans were complacent it means that we sat on our dust and we thought we got this\nAnd in in that capacity I never want to be part of the problem because I'm here I live here my show is here\nAnd I know and I was I was hanging out with my buddies into Ted Cruz campaign last night did a Facebook Live with Ted that I sit still posted I think ... we had a good time is about forty minutes or so talking about stuff pulling back the curtain on a few things it's all in the Ted Cruz Facebook page\nA and that that as we get down to election day\nIf it's for points or five\nOr God Forbid free or something like that it'll be like beta one and we'll never be rid of these people\n[laughter] I mean we have Democrats in Texas we just don't let 'em run the place and uh and then they'll go gunning for John Cornyn\nIn twenty twenty\nAnd a very important house race with house rules chairman Pete Sessions and district thirty two which is a lot of uptown Dallas and uh and they said oh breach in trouble\nYou have a job there's a reason for that sold the Trump agenda is working\nThere is no substitute for success and you may you may not be a diet and will you know check all the little boxes conservative fine I get it\nAll work on you [laughter] but ah ... there's ...

to guy rocket that's why free market solutions state run state funded risk pools\nCan help folks like you free market solutions\nCan help bring rates down ... bring premiums down can bring co pay down the Affordable CARE Act has been\nAnything but God Bless Kris Kobach guys ... best to use the family good health and good fortune\nAs we head into the weekend okay uh let let me for the following things thinking caps on here's what I Want you to come out with a ... as we begin the next hour if you're on hold stay there one eight hundred and five two oh one two three four [noise]\nMy friend Mark Davis is there and bring has been good news on a cruise versus ... radio guy I think it's good news is we take it away my friend mark from Dallas\nThanks very much you and it is indeed and good news last night I had the great pleasure and doing a little Facebook Live on Ted Cruz's a Facebook page which would make sense you can go to a take a look at that it was filled with a with a\nCharm and authenticity like when one point the images kind of went sideways we had to mess with that for a little bit but it was a it was always straight shooting from dead we talked about a\nA number of things going on in the end we cruised and old roar grace I give you from taxes my honest take which is unwavering and that is the cruise wins and it is not that close cruise wins and it will not be that close now\nDon't messed me up here taxes\nThat everybody listening I'm a huge would affiliates through the great state of Texas need to make sure that I'm right about that it's not about me but it's about our state it's about our country and that means that if if that does I think the blue wave is already dissipating\nBut is there a Democrat enthusiasm in taxes of their Democrat enthusiasm all over the country in the first opportunity that Democrats have to interrupt the Trump agenda the most conservative governance we've had since Reagan you bet there's Democrat energy\nBut the good news is there is Republican energy and it is freshly motivated the cabin only hearing absolutely had an effect it made\nUs in Suzie asked about the way we acted I I mean when when all of sudden conservatives on their list of heroes list Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins you know\nEveryone has been made better there has been a conservative fine infusion and Lindsey Graham I I I I Can't not love the guy\nHe's dead wrong and immigration maybe we should check back maybe got better on that too but on a whole lot of other things especially a war on terror national defense national security he's he's inspiring way correct and wonderful\nLindsey Graham ah is it has been a joy to behold for these last few weeks since that moment of magnificent righteous indignation\nThere in the Senate Judiciary committee when he just gave it to Democrat America for what they've done gave it to the Democratic colleagues for what they've done absolutely great and then Susan Collins a ... a wonderful woman\nOr a New England Republican meaning Swiss cheese conservatism unless they we don't we don't do Republicans in New England the way we do Republicans in taxes or\nOr or or Mississippi or Utah right it's a New England Republican we used to have Democrats in Texas who are more conservative than some New England Republicans but as I said I'd rather have an are by somebody's name in the state of Maine\nThen somebody in the state of Maine in the Senate with a D by their name so I've never sat at home drop in my fingers on the table going oh Susan Valentine never lamented that you take what you can get and all we got from Susan Collins is magnificent clarity\nI at ... two principal and the vote that got us justice Brett cap it off I Will be for ever grateful and meanwhile she better have food tasters and I am not kidding\nI mean they're they're they're mysterious packages being sent her home Lindsey Graham is being being spat on everybody's being dogged and screamed at an airport and I know it's a long walk from being screened at an airport to being shot\nBut today's violent left is something that cannot be ignored\nThe unhinged left exists and I've I've just got to tell you if you were in the Senate and you were a yes vote on Kavanaugh a you better I think our security is a very good idea and I am not\nKidding [noise] um\nHere's an example of a of of of someone who was getting a little I guess this is that the Al Smith memorial foundation charity dinner in New York\nAnd uh a ton of money gets raised mostly for children's charities it's absolutely great and it tends to have a political keynote speaker engaging in moments that are not so dry and political science [noise] last year it was for example house Speaker Paul Ryan\nAnd this year they secured a keynote speaker who is certainly attracted some attention of life and that would be soon to be former UN ambassador Nikki Haley so think about it okay Nikki Haley is your keynote speaker and the first comment she had last evening was about the selection\nProcess that led to her\nYear you write like Paul Ryan is a boy scout and that's fine that loan boring [noise]\nHere you want to do my thing again right that he wanted men and women\nWas worn down there and then I had\n[noise] E. okay [laughter] time up a brief worried about Nikki Haley I\nJust love her or she will you know when I make my list of my favorite un ambassadors ever which I guess I'll do if I ever had some time I buy and\nUh you know John Bolton gonna let us probably at the top of that list or ... or her and she's she's just great but

Sasse and [noise]\nYou know and and God Bless Jeff Flake kind of wish anybody ill I I Want everybody to just just go in there if you're going into private life just go do that and go do whatever you want to do\nAnd just to just leave me alone with his hand wringing cells floating navel gazing you know conservatism is bad under drugs drugs the anti Christ just just take that and and walk down appear alright\nHum but Nikki Haley as an example speaking of governors so is my other good friend and former Texas Governor Rick Perry in so many others I could name\n[noise] of people who who not only didn't know what to think about Donald Trump may flat out didn't like it they oppose the mice away the concept of his presidency the concept of his nomination and you know what they did\nThey came around they came around they open their eyes they open their minds and said wow okay maybe there's some stylistic things that I didn't love about this guy but I sure a lot of the results I Love is the economy\nI Love are stronger borders I Love the dismantling of the regulatory state\nI Love the tax cuts I Love it\nThere there's ...

yes\nI Love you so much that I started to care about the Cleveland Browns that's how much I Love you I offer that is tough line because my friend and your issue has never been as misguided as he is about first man this is a magnificent film it drips with American achievement\nThere is I Want to describe a nonexistent creature sunny a non existent creatures like sasquatch or a Jeb Bush supporter is nonexistent the person who has seen first man actually seen it and believes that it is anti American take the floor\nYeah absolutely I mean look this is a uh there there is a controversy that has been picked up a about first man in it is largely the fault of the star we have to ... to do with your uh you know at a press conference at the Venice film festival Ryan Gosling\nThat something really do is that he's got a dumb thing we can all agree that this was a dumb thing he said that uh Neil Armstrong adamant about not as an American hero but as a war hero now ... what kind of ... and in his own experience that Canadian Canadians of course don't have any heroes\nSo they have to appropriate the world the routes I Do I understand I understand what he was doing and look it was it was a mistake and\nInstead of putting out the fire the the the director even doubled down exactly but you said at truth thing which is that a within the context of the story of the actual planting a flag I mean again what we're talking about here is the planting of the spring of the pole\nIn the moon rock they do not show that that ... second clip of the moon journey okay\nUm but within the context of the film it makes perfect sense why they wouldn't do that uh when they get to the moon the films but just to kind of a more subjective experience that kind of put you in the edit Brian ...\nUh Neil Armstrong and\nAnd it is it is designed that way and it works I mean look you see you see the flag on the moon everyone is talking about how the flag has been a race from this movie insane nearby everyone everyone who talks about how this movie downsized American achievement or or suggest that it's not about the face races insane\nEveryone who talked about how this is not\nA an event that had fired the rest of the world to follow American achievement in American greatness is is just wrong I mean there's ... after\nThe moon landing takes place there's literally a montage\nOf people talking about how great America is there's a French woman says the French we could never do it but America can do it I always believe that now but I mean it's like it is ... ... anyone who actually seeing is moving I don't know anyone who actually goes to the it just relying on the uh angry uh uh\nI mean and I get it I totally get it because Hollywood is a snake put this thing that filled with America hating Dennis ... I Know it's so it's an easy target ... so I just I'm I feel I feel cleansed\nI it was great and it also by the way all this crap aside it is a magnificent films ... does an unbelievable job putting you inside the sole inside the helmet inside the spacecraft is a remarkable movie\nYeah I I I thought it was quite good I mean look and there are reasons to criticize the film I've read a plenty of negative reviews that that had in a intelligent accurate things to say about the film but if you the reason you're avoiding this movie is because you think uh that it eighth America\nBut you are you're you're doing it wrong as soon as we as we can say\nI Know we've got at least one or two new ones but give me thirty seconds is star is born as good as thirty people I Know say it is\nI mean look at its high melodrama it is a it is we've we've seen the story before so it's not like there's going to be anything particularly new or interesting a Lady Gaga is fine uh in kind of her first big breakout role\nA for as as an actor I'm Bradley Cooper is great I think ...\nOr is the best the best thing about the movie ... it's fine it's I it's not really my cup of tea buddy undoubtedly well made and it is a the the songs are you know they're good pop\nDarn good or if it works and I just think of the things that here's something that's not my cup of tea but I prepared to respect that did American e to Halloween remake\nWell what does America need\nOlive oil and it's a good thirty seconds or they're not good\nIt's it's good I thought I thought last night actually when I Would have an audience um\nAnd we were we were all kind of enthralled at the at the right moment that was it was scary where it needs to be a funny where it needs to be an interesting\nOne one quick thing I'll say about it is it is interesting um [noise] uh how they they try to treat the idea of evil or throughout the movie people are trying to get Michael Meyers to talk to explain himself\nAmerica morning glory of great music means it's time for the wholesale dialogue will last or radio hour a\nWeek and I enjoy and as I Am by most weeks Dr Larry aren't president Hillsdale College all things Hillsdale are collected in Hillsdale dot edu including an application that fight institution the opportunity to sign up for him prime is there a newsletter\nAnd a bunch of great online courses especially about the constitution but also about Winston Churchill in Shakespeare and all of our conversations which began in twenty Thirteen about Homer\nAnd it brought us to the constitution itself today are all found ... failed dot com doctor aren't Good Friday morning to you thank you for joining me\nGood to you too All right we're back because of current events I have to go backwards in our constitution series to article one\nSection three the United States Senate and the reason I'm doing that is\nNot surprisingly as the Republicans seem intent upon keeping and indeed expanding their Senate majority we've seen online and on air arguments of the Senate is non representative and must be changed that it's wrong for North Dakota have two senators et cetera so I bought\nLarry aren't as the founders key author one of his great books on the frame or is that what they intended and we're going to talk about the Senate and what it is supposed to do this morning\nAn article one section three says the center of the United states shall be composed of two senators from each state chosen by the legislature they're up for six years in each senator show have one vote now they're choosing part has been changed\nBy the seventeenth amendment which now reads the center of the United states should be comprised of two senators from each state elected by the people there are for six years in each senator show how one boat that was ratified in Nineteen Thirteen\nSo our original document was updated in Nineteen Thirteen wrongly a right way but we kept that Larry aren't we kept that two senators would you explain the theory and practice their up [noise]\nAh well the the ... original is slightly different from the current ah they both have the same central principal the original was a compromise in the ... the biggest compromise in the ... made the constitution come together\nAnd that the compromise was shell there'd be two chambers both represent ... just the population of the United states or shall there'd be two chambers one of them represent any of the states\nAnd uh that compromise was necessary to get the constitution through\nAnd in my opinion also good and I will tell you that James Madison and Alexander Hamilton who was the initial enemies of the compromise\nThey came around to that way of thinking to the ... convention produced a consensus on most of the big things and why well at the the thing is they were looking out already upon a continent\nAnd they didn't know how big it was yet they they didn't find that out for almost Twenty years uh actually you know the almost Twenty years\nLewis and Clark Lewis and Clark right so somebody came back you know is big day when Lewis and Clark outback\nTell me about it so it's a country [laughter] you know what what is this thing you know\nAnd that but they were keenly interested in the thing right so George Washington's army was called the continental army and then the question is and they also very much believed and this is in the art arguments of the federalist papers more than the anti federalist but it's in both sets of papers in various places\nThe argument is you're going to have to have a big country and you're gonna have to have a big country for a lot of reasons but one of them that's obvious and simple is national defense and we don't want to build another Europe here we don't want you know all that you know and the borders neighbors wars\nConstant intrigue and so they were interested in extending the sphere of the United states and the deeper reasons or in federal is none and now they're about how you can get better divisions of power\nUltimately more excellence in government by having a wide spear so they're they're gonna be a big country\nNow the question is how do you represent and just take the Senate is like a massive fact that happened in the same summer is riding constitution in the northwest ordinance they devised a method for the country to grow\nAnd the method is not that uh the new territory will ever be treated as a colony it would not\nIt would be treated as a territory soon to become a state\nAnd then there's one thing that's always a consensus in the ... in in the founding era and then the constitutional convention and that is most things done by government will be done locally as close to the people as possible\nSo now at the national level you've got to represent the continent and and you know huge diverse\nChanges in territory and geography and therefore\nThe way people live and so you want to represent that too and you want to represent the whole of it because the challenge is to unite a great empire of liberty so the Senate is for balancing its for protection of local\nAnd it's for uniting the country section by section into a whole\nTo stretch out of many disparate parts one quilt of liberty now Larry on our framers were often on horseback traveling great distances not just during the revolutionary war but before and after\nAnd back and forth to the Annapolis convention to the Philadelphia Convention this day ratifying convention\nAnd they were acquainted with the diversity of this great country and this is not merely no it is partially\nA slave owning interest versus the abolitionist interest is not merely that they also recognize that there were Merck until the states like New York an agrarian states like Georgia and small states like Ryder Rhode Island and ... states like Virginia which at the time of this\nWas literally unlimited I Believe uh because of their ... got ... all the way extending as far as it could go so what part did that recognition of the of the deep diversity of America play in the coddling together of the Senate\nYeah well they they would not yeah they did the the word diversity occurs in the federalist papers good point [noise] um so yeah and just remember people today people have real attachment to the place where they were born\nAnd grew up in Michigan you lived there all those unbelievable it's as they used to even Michigan they're attached to yeah yeah but 'cause you know first of all what choice if you got you're going to go to Ohio\n[laughter] so it's ah so it's a a it's a\n... yeah you you know you like the football team from your state and you like a baseball team and all that right and that's just a reflection of something larger you\nKnow yes yeah if you grow up in California if you grow up in\nUrban California you know where I Lived a long time and you live a long time then you know God help you it's it's in some ways very similar to growing up in urban Boston but in other ways really different\nCompletely a hundred percent different because of the freeways and the beach because of the the music and the restaurants because of the fact that you have
