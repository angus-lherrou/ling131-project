I think Martha McSally\nA very likely could when I Am just saying that it is not incredulous that there are Republican women out there or some people they consider themselves Republicans that usually votes Republican for Congress that are going to go into the booth\nVote for Doug do see because they didn't Garcia is completely out of whack but that was on a federal issue they're going to take a different mindset into the boots and they're going to say to themselves but I'm going to vote this way on this race I think it's possible\nI think I I think we see this all the time we're on on federal or state or federal issues voters make different calculations and so I just said don't rule it out\nAnd when you have polling it's anywhere from you know a few points this way to a few points that way it indicates that there's a close race but I think mark the mix Sally very well could win I like the crowds cinema has had a horrible few weeks\nAnd so I'm not going to be surprised when ... looked Sally way let me just\nTelling you mean by going to win by ... which she wins by more than five points favorite director let's look back at this conversation because it isn't close it isn't even close that's why I I have a problem with I don't know Manhattan audio late\nI don't think that's just don't women have media elite look I talked to people in Arizona who knows the race on no Sally want her to win and they are the ones telling you this is a close race they're the ones that are not tell any do big blowout everybody's getting this wrong so\nSo low out five percent plus and I talked to the Republican pollsters that you talk to and and and when I see an NBC poll that is a hundred percent off I think to myself the media is trying to resuscitate a dead impact not what\nHappened that's not what happens it's just that a lot of these public pollsters don't know how to poll individual states I see this in West Virginia I see this in Nevada is especially Nevada all the time it's knowing\nWe're joined by Lani ... David in dance that they tell us over institution always someone what am I go to analysts as we get close to an election which is a week out Loni I look at the numbers and I'm very very very optimistic about their Republicans in the Senate and I'm not resigned are losing their houses I was a month ago what say you\nYou I'm In the exact same places you are a I think Republicans look very very good in the Senate fight this is something that we always thought would happen as we got closer to the race that some of these races would settle out and I think we're seeing that for sure\nYou know the house is really a toss up I I I think it's one of those things where it's very very difficult to predict exactly what the margin is going to be\nBut I think Republicans are going to be competitive coming into the stretch run here on the house side but the Senate does look very good no question about it\nNow what are the things that ah that I Want to always report objective way my audience and the NBC and mirrors put out a full this morning that shows Kristin cinema up five points over Martha McSally now I have seen the internal polling from a Republican pollsters in Arizona the early voting was ten plus are\nThey use a five plus our model for the electorate and Martha McSally wins by five and a half percent under that model and so they're under estimating the actual Republican turnout\nAnd I do not believe Arizona is going to vote for radical and you know Arizona pretty well what do you think\nRights I think there's a few factors you're the first of all absolutely the data I've seen as well from Arizona suggest that the early vote has come in I had to pay for Republicans in other words if you compare early vote in ... in two thousand and Eighteen versus early vote in two thousand sixteen\nUh things are looking favorable in two thousand Eighteen even as opposed to twenty sixteen cycle which was a ... which was a good cycle for Republicans Arizona the second point is is just the fact that it just in cinema\nI I mean not only is as someone who has seen fit to\nCriticize Arizona and Arizona ends but someone who's record is is really from the far left and I think when people really sit down and they think about what the choices are you've got Martha ... decorated combat veteran\nSomebody who has represented the people of Arizona well versus someone like his cinema who who's record is really quite out of touch\nI tend to think that even the late breaking voters will settle in favor of Martha ...\nDon't get me wrong it's going to be a close race I think five is a little bit dramatic at the margins from Sally I think she when she with more in that two to three point range but I just have a very difficult time seeing the people of Arizona voting for care to send them to someone who's so fundamentally is out of touch with the values of the people that\nArizona law any I don't know if you've played our mid term madness game yet\nBut I'm hoping that you will go over to ... dot com and play it because I well I I I I Believe the margin of victory say people have to pick the winners and twenty five racist but they also have to pick margin of victory\nAnd I'm going to do plus for for Martha McSally which we have you know under one one to three and plus for a margin of victory and I think it's going to be so much easier than people believe ... but that\nThere is a built in desire in the media\nI mean deeply ingrained almost subconscious to make races competitive when they are not when they hit the wall and it sort of like Todd Akin hitting the wall in St Louis Christians to them is the Democrats topic and she just absolutely ran her boss right into our office the Grand Canyon cliff and and there is no way\nTo recover from that it's like Todd Akin talking about voluntary rape um six years ago you just can't come back from that\nLet me talk to them about the met a thing that's going on here Democrats were panicked or a week ago because the cabin on fact Israel and by the way it continues to be real ah people were disgusted by what they did to Brett Kavanaugh\nAlong comes the crazy bomber David French calls him a super fan I call them a deranged psychopath uh son's Thirteen would be bombs and they were bombs to targets and then comes the neo Nazi Trump hating massacre of Pittsburgh Jews\nI think Democrats are hoping that the jar to the country\nWill somehow jar the election and Catherine Rampell writes in the Washington Post today this almost astonishing to me\nThe White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump for poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what their rights\nTrump isn't to blame his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election now I Believe she sincere and I believe most of the elite media believes that but I think that\nAbsolutely is repulsive to the ordinary American what do you think ...\nI I not only is it is it repulsive but it it it just defies reason this notion that somehow\nBecause you've got Republicans that have tried to work together with President Trump in advancing an agenda for the American people that somehow or because they they are responsibility for what is clearly fundamentally the responsibility of at the range to a man\nWho sent pipe bombs through the through the u._s. mail\nA and and and a and a person filled with hatred who committed in my mind and I forgive all act and so\nI look at this as part of the media narrative you get it you understand it at some point it was always going to get here how is it that the folks in the media are going to figure out a way to try and blame Republicans to turn the election\nAnd I think you're I think you're seeing that now the question is whether it's going to work or not and and I'm just I'm I'm not sure that will I mean I see the narrative out there I see a lot of people trying to make this case\nUh but I but I just don't see it I think at the end of the day it's election particularly on the house side it's just going to be a whole lot closer than people think\nAnd you know we'll see what the outcome is but I I I I just think the American people are going to come back to the fundamentals here which are strong economy a lot of accomplishment that Republicans can rest their record on ... and you get a lot of Democrats running that are fundamentally out of touch\nAnd and I also believe always in the fundamental common sense of the American voter they realize if they don't like Donald Trump\nVoting for example for Christian sentiment is not the response you empower the responsible Republican Senate led by Mitch McConnell you don't empower radical leftists and I think there is um a\nI'll call it the bounce back in fact people notice when they use aspirin for example in them nasal congestion the more you use it the worse it gets the more you know he's crazy rhetoric the crazier gets this is Julie I off with Jake Tapper last night Simone Sanders David Urban onset as well give a listen to this number six\nTo ... I think you know the fact that at one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on and talking about atomic rat on radicalization and\nHas radicalized so many more people than I have my dad I mean the way he talks the wasteful waste that says it is to stop\nRight there that was David Urban looking just amazed and perplexed as I did now she later apologized they stopped the show they let her come back and do a clean up on I'll be but none have when you get stuff like that you realize the Democrats are unhinged\nYeah I mean this is the problem with\nWith where we are now is that you know look we can all have a discussion about whether we would we would like the president at times to today take a different tone I think that's entirely appropriate critique but\nFor some reason I think people on the left goalie that it allows them to to say things that are completely ridiculous and by the way she thought the only one who is the thing you know things like this notion that somehow\nA you know we we we ... what's happening\nWith his lot Islamic terrorism abroad to some of what we see here the accurate despicable make no mistake but trying to draw these comparisons trying to to use these parallels to attack\nThe president of the Republican Party\nIs it is just off faith and I have to say I do think it is a function of the time we find ourselves\nIn its rhetoric become acceptable\nWhen we play for you ah Marsha Blackburn had a rally yesterday but she began when a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh this is what happened cut number eight\n\n\n\nIs interrupted a moment of silence for a for victims to do that and Marsha Blackburn was stripped to Twitter last night I think tendency will be revolted by this is why I think that that crazy woman who did that\nA destroyed Phil Bredesen any chance of his coming back because it's it's scary it's actually kind of bare unhinged\n[laughter] yeah I mean in in in that race in particular Phil Bredesen was already cooked you know if if he could be any more cooked after that I you know I mean he certainly is\nI think I think I think people see that and they want it does is it makes clear for them what

party is this represents the left actually the White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump were poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what they're right\nTrump isn't to blame she writes his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election\nI think she accurately represent the left and the media is point of view and that that is a Republican to most Americans what do you think senator\nHere that that kind of rhetoric is more than most Americans are I don't know who described her as a but the only person to blame for the kind of horrific shooting we saw in Pittsburgh on Saturday if you're a deranged anti Semite um who should be locked up for the rest of his life\nNot put 'em wise or the person that sent those\nSuspicious packages last week or so and the blame there\nJust as hotter than a former Bernie Sanders volunteers person to blame for almost ... and who knows how many other Republican congressman he would've killed if it hadn't been for two you're brave Capitol Hill police officers\n[laughter] let me play for you the height of Trump's arrangements syndrome is Julia Ioffe off last night with Jake Tapper on CNN cut number six\nI think you know the fact that at one of the things that hole where they launched his presidential run on and talking about Islamic radical radicalization and has radicalized Sal many more people\nThan I just add like right there she would later come back and apologize for that remark I Want to be fair to wear because they got hammered on the air when she said that but Tom Cotton that anyone could even give voice to that without stopping to show immediately in and said dismissing someone from the fact is amazing to me [noise]\n[noise] yeah he remember this is the ... same woman who accused Donald Trump of sleeping with his daughter a couple of years ago\nUm I Can't imagine that in a respectable journalistic outlet wants to be associated with someone like that or people like these authors who met you I think sometimes they view themselves as heroes and there are internal morality play\n'em they're so deep inside the beltway New York bubbled I simply and understand that a lot of Americans um for the president's agenda they believe the economy is growing stronger cause we reform our tax code and we're on our regulatory system that our military strong as ever and Americans perspective again\nIn the world I understand that may not play very well in the Upper East side of Manhattan or in Bethesda, Maryland but there are millions and millions of Americans across the country in places like Arkansas that actually do believe that support the president's support the Republican Party and it's fine to oppose it was like the campaign against us cod and went back to the white\nUm but that kind of rhetoric or as really uncalled\nFor and I wonder how do we fix the media I think media is poisoning in America and I I Try and bring on left right and center and try to be civil with everybody and you're always civil and all the Republicans are any John Kerry and civil and people are civil but\nI watch cable and I think it's just pumping poison from both ends into the mainstream your thoughts last minute senator cotton\nAh well my first thoughts or don't watch those cable news networks so you um you know unfortunately baseball
