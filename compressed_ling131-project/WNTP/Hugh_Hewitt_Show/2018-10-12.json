Khan usa dot org and be generous Tim Roebuck on USA dot org yesterday at eleven o'clock\nI went to the White House kind of crazy Kanye and Jay Brown where they're at the same time but I was over and the oldie obey I sat down with our national security advisor Ambassador John Bolton and here's the conversation we at\n... thanks for talking to me to ... so you're glad who had hit a use for your entire life for this job and you were right with the most disruptive president says Andrew Jackson in the world or to that is collapsing is the job I Would have thought it wouldn't be given all the years that you've studied the ad I say\nWell I think it's a it's a it's a job that really gives you an opportunity to serve the president or who's who's in office in every president has a different style or I think good job of the national security advisor really is to make sure that whatever the style of the president that he gets the information he needs to make decisions\nOr that he has the range of options that he needs and then that those decisions are carried out so that's my job I think it's fine that we've got a disruptive president even a kind of chaotic world because there are a lot of changes that need to be made\nA we're seeing a lot to do bills come do from the Obama administration so it's very fast paced\nUh but uh I wouldn't trade it for anything else\nLet me ask you about her old job since it's now in the United nation Nasser you're right I'm interested in President twofold what kind of personality and should this be a job in the cabinet or should it be a cat it\nWell you know on the second one it's really up to the president or he can make any job a cabinet rank and he'll make his decision a as he sees as best\nI ... I did not have cabinet rank uh when I was ... I don't think it affected me in any way either up at the un or in my dealings within the administration\nI think it's a job where you have to be prepared to get deep into the substance of issues I think it's very important in implementing policy and mostly what you do at the un has implement policy that you\nUnderstand the significance of the actions you're taking a and it'd be part of a team I felt very privileged when I was there I helped make policy but I have a mostly to carry policy out\nSome national circuit advisors travel a lot some stay close to the oval office what's your travel schedule like looking forward especially between now and the election\nWell I've spent most of my time in Washington or or traveling with the president when he travels overseas or I have done some travel I've got a trip coming up to Moscow in the caucuses countries are in about ten days\nReason for that is to continue to carry through on the conversation that President Trump and present potent hadn't Helsinki during the summer to talk about\nU.S Russian relations and where we can make progress where we still have issues and disagreement or and then in the caucuses to see the very significant geographical a role that they have dealing with Iran dealing with Russia dealing with turkey\nSo it's selected I worked very closely with Jim Madison I ... we had breakfast this morning as we do once a week to kick all these issues around and I think that's very important that the national security advisor I think under any presidential style has to be an honest broker and I I work hard at that\nWhen you sit down with your counterpart Russia next week are you going to tell them hands off our election I may say three or four times loudly\nYeah well every time I've met with the Russians in this job including with President putting himself when I went to Russia to prepare for the Helsinki meeting I've made that point as has the president\nA is a message to believe that we received well\nSo far we don't see the kind of Russian meddling we did in twenty sixteen Chris Wray the director the FBI said a couple of weeks ago that that could change with the stroke of the ... we are very worried about the question of Chinese interference not just in individual elections\nBut more broadly trying to influence\nThe American political discussion with an influence campaign that uh I I think could well be unprecedented we heard vice president Pence speak to this issue or last week it was a very important speech I think people need to read it and consider it a and I think the United states needs to stand up frankly to any foreign government\nThat thinks it's going to interfere in our politics we are a self governing people\nWe will govern ourselves we don't need international institutions that tell us how to do it and we particularly don't need foreigners are trying to exert undue influence over\nAs well that was issued to the story of a day ... we're trying to influence the response of the Saudi Government to the world at noon on Thursday are you satisfied with what the Saudis have told us about the disappearance of Mr ...\nWell I don't think we've we've known enough or I spoke with the crown prince yesterday along with Jared crushed or a secretary of state Mike Pompeo spoke to the crown prince says well the the president has spoken to this issue or it is something we need to get resolved to end or we need to do it as soon as possible\nIn the aftermath of the Annapolis newsroom shooting some people criticize the president or has the enemy of the people that are in the aftermath of the shaggy disappear and some people have said that the president is turning a blind eye to violence against journalists are across the world particularly Russia what do you make a critic for the president trying to tie him to the shy as\nWell I think this is ridiculous I mean I think this is a he has spoken out about it uh he's directed the secretary said ... uh to speak with a ... a fiance and that'll happen as soon as they can get that scheduled\nA we're taking a number of other steps or that I really can't get into at the moment but I think that uh it's just a hypocritical to say that somehow the president's not concerned about these things when manifestly his words in his actions are to the contrary\nUh Mr Nasir Saudi Arabia and political structures at best convoluted is it possible way or the Henry the second situation who will get rid of this metal suit priest spiraling out of control or even something more and more level what that someone intended to undermine the crown prince and the king via this action\nYou know honestly we just don't know what the facts are and that was one of the points that are that I made to the crown prince\nOr we need to find out what the facts are and we need to get this resolved quickly because if it is a a a a another operation a people need to understand that I I think the the Saudis themselves are being damaged because we don't have the facts out\nThere is obviously been historical animosity between turkey and Saudi Arabia or we have our own difficulties with turkey at the moment with they're keeping pastor Brunson effectively under house arrest for no good reason whatever so this is a this is not that anybody's benefit and it needs to be\nCleared up is it possible that if the operation happen it could have happened without the knowledge of the crowd\nI think a lot of things are possible in the middle East I'm at the United states does not have information that is not revealing a if we had information wind or we know better exactly how to handle this we've made it clear we want to know what the facts are we are going to continue to do that\nLet me turn from our ally to our enemy or the commander the Iranian Revolutionary guard so I'm On social media to threaten the White House there are reports that there are sleeper cells in the United states given those sorts of threats and those sorts of records or American should we be alarmed about so I'm On these regions of the United states\nThink we should be I think the Iranian regime as an enemy of the United states are we just had a within the past ... on the arrest of two Iranian agents in the United states uh scoping out Jewish and Israeli\n... uh targets for possible attack\nUh we've seen France and other European countries arresting a agents of the Iranian intelligence service for planning an attack\nOn a rally dissident Iranians in Paris this summer we've seen transfer example now impose sanctions against Iran because of this behavior so we see Iran or not\nA conforming to western norms because of the Iran nuclear deal they've not done anything to try to modify are concerned about their continued support for terrorism around the world they are accelerating this this regime is a threat that's why the president\nUh got us out of the Iran nuclear deal that's why the economic sanctions or being re impose\nThat's why we're putting maximum pressure\nOn the Iranian regime and just to be clear we are having a very significant effect you can hear the European governments talk about staying in the deal\nEuropean corporations and I mean the biggest one the biggest oil companies the biggest manufacturing firms are getting out of Iran a Iranian oil exports are plummeting their currency has gone through the floor\nUnrest is spreading across the country even countries like China or reducing their imports of oil from Iran because they don't want to tangle with the United states\nUh this was something that we shouldn't be concerned about because Iran remains what it has been since Nineteen Seventy nine it's the\nWorld is leading state sponsor of tear at a press has its own citizens and it

up here in the studio hopefully it will be live on the air so I'm very very careful about\nNot rose scandal in the church in saying bad things about the pope I Believe this pope is isolated and clueless about the United states carries an anti American\nSort of South America and Jane in him and that he reflects anti America and therefore that lens him to be on the left when it comes to political disputes any tends to listen to left wing hers is tended to listen to Donald Wuerl\nAnd Donald Wuerl ended cutting a character is said I'm not sure if that's true or not a heater criminal he's been the priming has cardinal had has gone down a world got a nice send op letter from the pope I cannot believe that\nThere is an attorney general in Pennsylvania Josh apparently is a Democrat I'm In touch with them\nAnd they issued a grand jury report that is conclusive and probing Donald Wuerl covered up terrible crimes terrible terrible crimes he covered them up he did not make them available to the national review or a moot priest around\nEntered into in force of silences of victims it was awful what he did in Pittsburgh and then he got promoted because he had covered up so

good news that reading at the wall Street Journal this hour that turkey is expected to release pastor Brunson today\nHe'd been held hostage for many years uh he was been held since twenty sixteen so say a prayer as we go into breaking through that I'll keep following that but the wall Street Journal says they expect him to be released today\n... last night roaring through Virginia I think down in Virginia Beach Norfolk Hampton Roads area it's a lot of\nPower lines are down et cetera I'll keep you posted on that [laughter] I'm pleased to welcome the guy who would be in charge in Ohio were a disaster to\nHappen next year for the next four years might the one who's the attorney general in Ohio right now he's running for governor in one of the most closely watched races in the United states or a senator now attorney general DeWine welcome back to the euro ...\nHey it's great to be back with you and your listeners thank you very much\nOne of the things I think when we watch Michael come ashore governor a general DeWine is\nWe listen to candidates and we think to ourselves are they are they able to handle a crisis and you've been doing this a long time now but but speaking of Richard Cordray your your opponent has been a lawyer and a lawyer and he's been a lawyer by how 'bout you [laughter]\nWell you know I've really tackle some tough problems and the interesting thing\nUh if you compare Cordray and Mike DeWine is that we both are were attorney generals and uh you know I beat him eight years ago close race but I but I beat him but what we inherited a was a real mess so they turn Joel how runs the state crime labs and\nWhen we took office a court right left us was if there was a a rape or a serious crime that occurred in Ohio and the unknown DNA was taken to the state crime lab\nA it would have sat there if you can believe this for a hundred and twenty five days without him by overlooking that that's how far a backlog that they had\nAnd a quarter I left that mass and so we fixed it uh we turned cases around now\nA twenty four hours if it's an emergency uh we're doing four times as much DNA as we did the day\nHe left office and uh you know our average times about three weeks but we can turn case around very very quickly and another thing that he can pair Cordray and what we've done now he left um they were they were old rape kits sitting and police departments all over the state of Ohio law states that have this problem\nOr he didn't do anything about it when I became attorney general we we\nStart hearing about that and we actually have tested every single one of them we went out to all the police say bring it to us we want to get this evidence\nAre tested and uh we've tested as I said close to fourteen thousand uh some as these are all cold cases old cases uh some of his some Fifteen Years old and we've got hit or matches and thirty six percent so we've gone back\nYou know him better than a third and told the the local police who then turned told the victim hey we got your rape or we got your rapists\nAnd the entire county alone in Cleveland where we had a large large number of them uh they they have a indicted over seven hundred and fifty people right wow\nAs all of that so it it's it's a great lesson and you see a problem you go after it a quarter I just\nJust sat there and didn't uh you don't do anything and and don't forget of course is time are heading up Obama's of consumer group out in Washington if you if you recall\nUh we we saw for example or because of overregulation we ... we\nSaw the number of our community banks or go down significantly in Ohio and I'm sure that occurred in in other states as well just because of the over ... over regulation or that the Cordray and others had in place\nNow I got to ask you a general DeWine the idea that Ohio which is\nDoing well in this recovery I mean we've got I Know north eastern are pretty doggone well I Know\nA large town is cook and I know that that's Trump country as well up in moaning in Trumbull county ... county Cuyahoga County it's cooking why in the world would return the state over to the left the uh the last I mean what in the world well the people they think about\nThat that look that's absolutely right we're we're we're doing well in Ohio a we do not want to go back to where we were\nEight years ago eight years ago when Cordray I'm a ... you know was was attorney general and a ... ... you know he was the attorney general state of Ohio we had had lost a\nClose to four hundred thousand jobs\nAre and you know we just were not moving our unemployment rate was high and in the last eight years under Republican conservative leadership uh we've kept taxes down cut taxes are we seeing the economy move forward and so\nYou know what I Want to do my running mate John ... we want to take a while to the next level or we've come a long long way we do not want to go back uh we've got we've got a couple of challenges out there we got an opiate problem that we that we have to get in front of and now instead of a you know\nPeople are not being able to find jobs and not economy not moving forward our biggest challenge now for employers is to find people who are qualified or people who\nAre able to pass a drug test so what we're really focusing on Hugh is is two things uh one is tackling a drug problem we have a twelve point action plan that is makes makes real sense it's realistic\nUh some of the things I'm already shirt has already started to do is attorney general but there are things I Can't do it until\nTill I'm governor I mean one of the things that we want to we think is very important as education and prevention for young young kids in regard to drugs or you know I started my career as a county prosecuting attorney and I can tell you that I don't know in five years or ten years if we'll have an opiate problem but a ... there's always some drug problem\nAnd so we want to prepare young people starting as early as kindergarten K. through twelve southern age appropriate every year every year something that's been proven to to actually work\nUh we will implement that and it will make a huge difference the the other thing that we're we really want to do a is double down on President\nTrump's opportunities homes or were have opportunities owns Ohio a this will mirror the tax cuts are and and the job act that the president and Congress put through a we will make it so that\nAh somebody looks at the state of Ohio and I said well that's the place to invest that's where I I Want to take my ... capital gains I Want to take take it to Ohio or put it through this in our you know most problematic areas and you know we we believe that a given that tax break I was going to get a lot of money\nInvested in Ohio we hope from a you know all over the country\nAnd I'm going to help ... you know if you take\nThat up the young son Warren given the physical structure that exist there already in your combined with economic opportunities and they will cook I talked with a moaning valley chamber when they came to DC on their flying but first you got to win tonight I'm flying into Columbus

we're gonna we're gonna juice turnout but early voting gets going in the Buckeye State doesn't it I mean we're we're ...\nWe're into it or we should we ... we started this week and uh you know we're ... we've seen a since the cabin up a\nNomination and what the Democrats did and what happened in the Judiciary Committee we we've seen a real a firing up of our conservative base in Ohio a in a county is all over the state and you and you mentioned\nYou mentioned in an area of the state of Ohio in ... in eastern Ohio them hunting valley for example Steubenville\nEr which are very very familiar with you know historically historically big big a Democrat area bought socially conservative and what we saw of course\nIs what what President Trump did when he ran and did exceedingly well uh in areas that have never in in several lifetimes have not been gone gone Republican\nHumble county went for Trump bad happened since I think Nixon\nOh I'm sure that's right it's been it's been a long time but but you're right we lay lay are opportunities zones on top of that I mean\nWe've all we have them with with the tax bill but we're on doubled down in Ohio because we're going to say we're on to do that with our our tax code in the state of Ohio too and and we really believe that that's going to have a lot of investment [noise] ah we ... we can't have\nThere's there's not enough government money out there to have a government investment and have a we have to get the private sector and ... and we have some great things going for us and a lot of areas but with this with this tax cut that we're talking about that opportunity um it's a really spur economic development Ohio\nLast question attorney general Mike DeWine next governor Ohio and I was there for Rob Portman before

really gives you an opportunity to serve the president or who's who's in office and every president has a different style\nOr I think good job of the national security advisor really is to make sure that whatever the style of the president that he gets the information he needs to make decisions that he has the range of options that he needs and then that those decisions are carried out so that's my job I think it's fine\nThat we've got a disruptive president even a kind of chaotic world because there are a lot of changes that need to be made\nA we're seeing a lot to do bills come do from the

should Facebook be helping the People's Republic of China develop tools of information filtering and basically control when this as a nation that has admitted that a million like ours in concentration camps\nYeah I think vice president Pence spoke very eloquently on that point or at his speech at the Hudson Institute last week and I think the biggest applause line he got was when he said that the information technology sector don't cooperate with the Chinese in in this effort I Would say to shareholders of these\nCompanies that portray themselves as the open Internet transparent future really you want to make money off of repression I if I were a shareholder I'd I'd want to know what the answer of our corporate leadership was\nThe shareholders though we certainly would not have allowed him pre war Germany Americans to sell the crop iron works the design for new artillery are we is there a role for the government to step in and the Silicon Valley and control technology transfer where\nWe were looking at the export control area look we did this and continue to do it in terms of dual use technology that could affect nuclear chemical or biological weapons are ballistic missile development I think in cyberspace we're entitled to do the same thing\nThat because we've abandoned free market principles but because we have to be realistic about the adversaries we face in the world today that use the fruits of American freedom against us and we shouldn't let that happen we want to do it in ways to protect our open economy but the NIH others the ability to take advantage of it\nOr return to the previous administration in Bob Woodward's book a lot was overlook\nOne thing that was overlooked was a candidate mission that they had hit the scope of the north Korean nuclear problem front of the country so that they had to work for a President Obama had the war and President Trump but that was his biggest problem today in fact conceal the extent of the problem and we're we're prepared for a preemptive strike the Woodward describes\nWell that the Obama policy they describe this strategic patience\nA that is a sending in for doing nothing about North Korea\nAnd it's another example of the ... bill coming due for President Trump or I think the combination of the\nPotential use of military force against North Korea and the maximum pressure campaign that the president waged on the economic front is what has brought that Kim Jong onto the table Mike Pompeo has just returned from another\nTrip there will see a meeting I think between a chairman Kammen President Trump sometime in the next couple of months\nUh we'll see other efforts go forward the president has held the door open for North Korea he gave them a great little uh\nA movie in a in Singapore when he met with Kim Jong on the showed what North Korea's future could be so the doors open they need to denuclearize completely and reverse simply and if they do that and walk through the door of the future could be very different for the north Korea and people\nYou know John Holdren has been known for Twenty years is the most skeptical of skeptics a feel good diplomacy are you feeling good about the diplomacy with North Korea\nLook I don't think we'd be in the place we are today if we had continued to pursue a Brock Obama's policies I think four more years of that under Hillary Clinton\nWould've guaranteed and North Korea with deliverable nuclear weapons or the the future remains uncertain on the presence diplomacy he's optimistic he pressed his heart he does not have stars in his eyes about this\nNow they're just my palm pale neither does Jim Mattis neither do I\nShould we be encouraging our allies to match what the Chinese are doing the creation of artificial age holes in the parliament of in the Philippines and Japan can do it out there to be doing\nWell I think we've got to do more first to establish for the Chinese that we do not acknowledge the legitimacy of any of this the ship the near a collusion you mentioned a is an example of how dangerous Chinese behavior is\nWe have now gotten more participation by allies the British the Australians and others are are sailing whether it's through the south China Sea we're going to do a lot more on that uh I think we could see more exploitation of mineral resources in the south China Sea with or without Chinese cooperation\nThey need to know they have not achieved the fed accompli here\nThis is not a Chinese province and will not the\nTime getting the writer so I ask you to things Russia's in the rearview mirror and Christopher Wray said this yesterday they're worried about today's problems trying to write about tomorrow's problem how much of a strategic thinking stock in a rush of first as a problem and not focused on China as\nMajor geopolitical strategic challenge of eccentric\nWell I think we do see China as the the major issue of the century I don't think we're stuck in the rearview mirror but what I Would say is in a world that's now post post Cold War\nWe are in a very complex environment the United states faces a range of challenges globally summit the strategic nuclear level summit the level of terrorist threats\nWe've got to be prepared across the spectrum are threats in a way we've never had to be in our history and the nineteenth century we were much more isolated than we are today we are the global power and are threats are global as well\nAnd what is the president's grasp of the geo political complexities of the war we get this question all the time you deal with them daily\nWell I think he's got a all the grasp of it he needs the the one difference between a President Trump and other presence is his economic background and he sees and emphasize his economic issues\nExhibited stage right towards England last night after taking two hundred thousand people with power in southern Virginia and leaving a trail of destruction tears\nWhen the panhandle north I Am joined by Dr Larry on President Hillsdale College Hillsdale dot edu for all of your Hillsdale needs\nAnd his online course on church which is apparently very necessary reading for some people in America who bought the church will gotten to the cabinet business doctor on before we begin with justice cabinet um tragedy at this level is a little hard for people\nTo grasp but when you look in the Panama city's gone Mexico City beaches gone to jail Airforce base which was home to three thousand people in the military all their possessions are gone but why do you tell your students about tragedy and the sadness of it [noise]\nYeah well you got to pick up and go again but that that's you know when this thing come true and they the water is the big thing you know the way in modern buildings don't really look out all that much but the water comes and that just you know you got to start over\n... when when England went through the ... and large parts of it were destroyed and every night this terrible stop what happened how ... how did they introduce resilience or was that just part of the national character already\nWell uh you know people don't like being bombed and now that are happening [laughter] and then makes them just like the people who are doing it they got really rapidly now they they uh you know what\nThere was prime minister of Great Britain and he was pretty good job so not only did he give eloquent speeches it's also true that they came up with an insurance scheme\nYou know and so you didn't bear the burden of that yourself and the way it worked you know you can drive through London today and if you see\nA a cluster of old buildings and then an interruption with new buildings and then the old buildings resume that's a bombing pattern\nAnd if you go up blocking turn left and left again you'll see the same thing repeated in the next block over and so it just cuts swamps down of London and you know if you were in the law and you got you got hammered but it was it was a you know people wanted to know\nWhat's so it's different than you know a natural thing like this or is anybody with him to get angry here well I guess you can blame it on me for global warming argue\nBut yeah yeah that was there was a lot of that going on by the way ... and they forget the Labor Day storm of the Nineteen thirties the destroyed a lot of Rhode Island they forget Camille in the sixties I mean it it's convenient the Gulf goes up and down and different years it's up to share and that made it tougher\nMhm yeah it\nDid and uh and it if you live on the coast you know and what we see in this Michael thing is living right on the coast is\nDangerous if you live in the Gulf from the Atlantic seaboard but uh if you know she lived five miles and that's not like you're enjoying wonderful coastal living now and so those people are getting punished and that's too bad\nYou know I talk this morning with a northern Virginia beach family or because they have two hundred thousand people without without a power down there and so it started in Florida went through Georgia South Carolina North Carolina an exit in Virginia [noise] that's just never happened before that is a weird thing that we're going to have to see the president respond to it but now\nWhen I told everyone a chamber of a con usa dot org if they want to help out let's turn to the other tragedy which was the violence done to the presumption of innocence\nAnd I think this is a answer the mob rule that with legitimize a and to the difference between political rallies and chanting lock her up which I don't particularly approve out but it's a rally and it's a chance [noise] versus menacing Ted Cruz and his wife in a restaurant with the imminent threat of violence or the ... the mobs in\nPortland I think we've lost our capacity\nTo distinguish Larry between political speech and political violence\nTo two weeks ago a\nIn a ... I read something by the ... and I heard a talk at Hillsdale by Charles Kessler and they both use the expression cold civil war and uh you know this is like the early Nineteen fifties right entertainment news zooming Eighteen Eighteen fifty Shia Eighteen\nFifty and what's the future of it the point is we have to have an agreement\nThat we're going to decide our political differences through a process\nAnd the process has to be agrees in advance and especially if the process is hallowed then you don't want to mess with it\nRight if you read Lincoln's great first inaugural address he says that the first time that\nA ballot ever placed bullets in a fundamental political it was just it was an eight hundred in the United states of America which I think is true so so the point is you're going to so the the people elect under the constitutional process that he's a majority in the Senate\nAnd the president of the same party and he gets to elect a bunch of people on the Supreme Court that can't be planned in advance that's you know that's how the constitution works and so\nTo obstruct the process because you know what what I think is\nIt was a shame for this thing even to be taken up and the reason is\nThat that lady seems like a fine lady ensues sincere but there is no evidence for this and it happened you know a human generation ago when Brett Kavanaugh was it was a kid so the thing is that something that you just would not be able to get to the bottom of\nIt is it is a problem of proof that the very beginning\nThat ought to have been recognized that interminable but it was politicized who was weaponized I Want to pause\nFor a moment of cold civil war veteran I have a disagreement about this from Charles and I I went up the ante them two weekends ago and that's a hot civil war that twenty three thousand people that in one day from a dunk or church all the way down to burn side bridge and\nEven in the Eighteen fifties we had you know John Brown and the Bush sweaters in Kansas and stuff like that or we're not there but I Do think the warning about what happens\nWhen we don't realize that debate can be fierce but you cannot men is that is the constitutional pests by the way and in the in the Supreme Court\nWhich is the intention and the ability to incite violence is illegal it's not protected speech\nThat's right that's right and you know the so I I think I said this on a couple of weeks ago but\nIn in the Nineteen forty five Winston Churchill last elections the socialist whom he said what ultimately result in a ...\nAnd the socialist got forty eight percent of the vote and they got over sixty percent of the seats and so\nOf course the conservatives rumblings about that and Churchill gives them a speech he's the leader of the opposition now and he says we're not going to complain about that this is the constitutional system this is how they got in and this is how we're going to replace them and so\nYou know it it contrast that with the ... of the electoral college and now the Senate in the country in other words there isn't any constitutional range but that shouldn't be it's not subject to a salt in the interest of partisan politics of the day\nIt is that is true everything is under assault and if you're not on the right team\nThe media will absolutely demonize you and by the media I mean the broadcast networks

that that is true that you can't go low [noise] there is nothing so low about Trump that will get thrown off the air yeah me neither I Am in violence may be a threat of violence that would do it\nWell that's a crime as you said and then not protected speech and violence against the president is a particular crime\nOr so they don't they don't do that but I mean lord is a movement to impeach Brett Kavanaugh going on right now\nAnd it's in you know the uh the chief justice his referred to as a complaint that he did not manifest judicial conduct in answering the charges against him before the Senate that's been transferred the tenth circuit but the point is\nEverything is going to be harassed at every step and that's the tone of politics these days\nWhen we come back from break Dr Larry on
