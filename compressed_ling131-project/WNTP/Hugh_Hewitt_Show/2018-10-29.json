beginning Josh Hawley who's the attorney general of the state of Missouri is running for the United States Senate and the show me state against Claire McCaskill and the most recent polling I obscene\nHas him ahead by a very solid poor points I actually believe it's further ahead than that Josh Hawley welcome back to the show my right your father had in most places in four points\nWe feel uh we feel very good about it you but we also know that we've got eight days ago and we can't take anything for granted that it's going to be a tight race going to be tied all the way home and we've got to get out there and a while we found that I expect that\nNo I haven't heard a lot of places in Missouri from St Louis we got a big flame thrower there to cross campuses city et cetera so tell people in Missouri specifically are they still able to do early voting or is that close to\nWhere we have this traditional absentee voting in Missouri we don't have a we don't have early voting like other states but the traditional as a voting and a look of a we need folks to start planning to get out on November the six to make sure\nThat you set aside time to vote talk to your friends if if they uh I Need help getting to the polls or make sure that you know you're you pick a friend with you through the bowls and we're going to need every last vote because it's going to be thought\nJosh Hawley it seems to me though that the Democrats are basically folding their tent in Missouri in North Dakota to try and save by boat so there were Claire McCaskill at an awful debate performance she and her ads calling other Democrats crazy Democrats how did that play with their base\nWell you know I I think it does show that the ethical really has read the desperation phase of her campaign I mean you could see that in in our debate\nLast Thursday these very angry very frustrated but your ear the thank you for restoration is really not with the with the voters of the state I mean she has not done what the voters of the they told her to do is not done what he promised them she would do\nAnd they're not happy about it and and that's the problem that we're gonna lose\nA role and Martin who's across them into the lab but he's a friend of mine just pointed out that Claire McCaskill not quote one of those crazy Democrats quote and was one of the dumbest ever recorded in political history she needed a strong energized space in twenty Eighteen her appeal to white rural voters\nWith that ad ticked off black voters if she loses that ad is the reason so you can see right there uh\nJosh Hawley that she clearly is flailing\nWell I I think there's no doubt about that I mean is ... that's a good word or she is she's frustrated she desperate you is you know let's remember what we saw from the Democrats\nAnd the Kavanaugh near the few short weeks ago is that they are willing to stay and do anything in order to regain power and I'm afraid that are McCaskill who was with that mirror every step of the way that is no different than so uh this is really this election as a referendum\nOn what they want to do to our country on their behavior they're just the disgrace that they are carried out with regards to judge cabin on their entire\nAgenda that with the lectures about\nNow let's talk a little bit about the the judge Kavanaugh a confirmation now justice cabinet or a successful confirmation\nClaire McCaskill was invisible uh she didn't she as she voted against them but she was invisible because she couldn't figure out what to do what in Missouri and think about that because he's obviously a good man well qualified and he was mirrored what did they think about her getting from that debate\nOh I I think there appalled by it and I have people say to me all the time they just cannot believe the way that the Kavanaugh was treated they can't believe the way the Senate Democrats the coordinated your campaign and your rights that are McCaskill\nAt well she went right along with it you should never raised their voices against it but she let's not forget she was in favor of the a Democrat Sam investigation she was in favor of delaying his confirmation vote so that this circus could go on I mean she's on record for all of those things so she was part and parcel\nOf the whole smear campaign and now she says in fact she said our debate I didn't have anything to do with that oh that's just nonsense I see what their ass\nThat by the way and I think voters are going to remember\nNow let's talk about the tragedy of this weekend a Josh Hawley when you get to the United States Senate you're going to be in a body that's very deeply divided in the country that is profoundly broken but I think part of the problem is that we're monetize ing hay on television where we've created little corners for people to indulge\nTheir worst visions of everyone on the other so how do we get past this moment\n[noise] well I think we've got to send a clear message for

dialogue\nThem starting the week with a health fail dialogue and Dr\nLarry earned because we are eight days from a crucial election and we are on the other side of a terrible massacre in Pittsburgh and a ... bomber in Florida and the incendiary rhetoric across the spectrum and I thought some history\nWould be used for your doctor Larry on good morning and thank you for doing a double dip this week a good morning how are you here\nOn good I I Want to begin by asking you to put a\nWhat the no nothing movement in context is because last night I saw a lot of people on line saying that Donald Trump is leading the modern no nothing's which is simply not historically correct then I knew I could turn to you for similar to the you know ... what the no nothing to work\nAs well so nineteenth century political movement or they didn't they thought that uh Jews and Catholics and\nAnd that they're they're especially focused on them and you know I don't know why anybody would be made against Jews but Catholics\nNow that I Know that we have to have to deprive ourselves of the of our sense of humor in these days but um\nThey they ah you know let Lincoln a lot of them voted for Lincoln a Lincoln denounce them and what they thought was that that it was a Protestant country by country and that it would be better if it remains so and they and that you know they were ...\nAnd around the country quite widely they never had a huge percentage of the vote and they were important because you know and in fact there isn't anybody quite like that important enough to to make a difference today that I Know of but they were important because politics for very narrowly drawn for\nFifteen or Twenty years divided on the slavery question but then ancillary matters\nThat could get four or five or two or three percent of the vote could change things a lot so they were important in American politics\nAnd they were ah they were not a passing phase they've never really gone away the idea of nativism into the eye that white Protestants on the country but neither have they ever have been very powerful and I do not believe they make up much or even an infant decimal percentage of the Trump coalition\nI don't believe I asked Secretary Clinton this when she was on the show last year do you believe there's more than a half\nMillion white nationalist in the United states and she agreed with me that there isn't and and ... were based on the hundred and thirty million people I just don't believe it is that many people do\nOne of them can do a horrific slaughter as was done Saturday in Pittsburgh we ought not to overestimate because by doing so we encourage the over estimation of their hatred\nA trade and ah you know I and not only do I do not believe that they're very many people like that I don't believe they're very many people who believe that there are very many people like that in fact many of the people who say that there are a lot of people like that I don't believe they believe it I think it's a political tool\nYes and explain why by the way I think it's going to burn their hand for picking up his tool ah and specifically I talk this morning about uh the network to which I contribute MSNBC is running high rise to lower third the little the words at the bottom of the\nOf the screen I Want to read to a couple of them Trump's role in stoking violence among Americans how Trump sets the tone for anti Semite you see they have picked up this ... this white hot\nSlander and I don't think it insurance to president I think it burns the people who employ it what do you think\nWell so there's a really great Holleman Jenkins car column on the wall Street Journal I read this morning it might have been from last week um and he makes the point that that a\n... you know everybody except for tiny sliver of the population or all of whom are probably watching MSNBC who knows\nUm think that there's just way too much of this stuff right that that this politically correct talk\nOr you know making Kelly him I have never liked by the way but she got fired and if she just left off one expression but she said was entirely objectionable\nAnd somebody at Netflix to write and sell their chords that go after but horse how big are the hordes right and as and as you say in a country of three hundred million plus how big are these hordes and the answer is not very big\nBecause most people don't think I mean if you just walk about in society and look\nYou will see the evidence of the fact that the society is organized around the principle of human equality and what human equality means of is a person treated like a person treats the same person like a person\nSo you just see in society today and it it wasn't always true with black people by the way which is a blight on our history\nBut you but it is true today just look and see\nAnd then you know hey if you think it's always been a racist country go study the Eighteen fifty eight election for the Senate\nIn ... Illinois where Abraham Lincoln won the popular vote on the claim that the black woman may not be are equal in all respects but in her right to eat the bread that she earned with the sweat ever owned face\nShe is the equal of every person on earth\nAnd I I Want argue audience where you've added to affiliates today a doctor Larry ... who have not heard you before and therefore will take some getting used to we have to knock the only news radio fourteen ten WTO V. in Dover, Delaware and radio news radio fourteen fifty W.

M. in Wilmington\nDelaware so they will not do our was one of the states that Lincoln had to worry about keeping in the union right Delaware was was a slave holding state him at the time of the civil war and Lincoln had to work very hard as he said\nI Hope that God on my side but I must have Kentucky he he needed the states and so he acted as a political person with regards to everyone in there but those sorts of politics that sort of new one is lost in cable when\nI mean it's just it's all your evil or you're not evil and by the way it's not just on the left is on the right as well and I think it's destroying politics\nWell I I don't so that I think that's right and and you know there was a lot of extremism in America in the Eighteen fifties goodness sakes you know there were plots to kill Lincoln and one of them succeeded finally [noise]\nBut but it's also true though that those debates between Lincoln and Douglas or very worth reading\nAnd then if you read them fairly in my in my argument if you read them fairly will see that the inspiring man one and the man who spoke for the meaning of America One and it's just a remarkable event in human history because\nThey would get twenty thousand people out in the sun sitting for four hours to watch\nThose debates and and that that means that in America there is this you know basic way that we get along as Americans and it's the principle that everyone who demeans himself as a good citizen quote George Washington\nHas the rights of a citizen and must all and and that means that the bias is there's a bias the bias is when you encounter somebody on the street treat him like a human being\nWho spoke for the meaning of America One I think that is so ... would you explain what that means\nWell the you know and so you know all political history\nBy the way has tragedy in it and there's even an argument it always ends in tragedy spent a are tragedy\nThey're very many remembering that it's the most glorious political story at least in modern times and the tragedy is that for the first time we found that the country according to the principle that all men are created equal and buy all men they meant women too\nAnd and then we had savory among us and been here for a long time here under British Rule\nAnd so what do we do about that and in the founding there's a consensus that that's a really bad thing\nSomething's got to be done about that eventually and in more than sixty percent of the union it was quickly abolished ah but then new ideas took this route and this is where the tragedy is in my opinion these new ideas said that no we're evolutionary figures\nAnd we evolved to be different kinds of things and by the way if you look at the thought of modern liberalism radical modern left wing liberal is some you will see lots of thinking just like this if I were talking about gene solved time now\nSo it's like it's like somehow your genes control your behavior which means the human soul is not free anyway that gets going and by Eighteen twenty that's a major force in America\nAnd then what are you going to do about it right and in the end what we did a bad it was we fought our worst war over the question is human being a product of his heritage or is it a free soul created by God\n... will come back to discuss more of that in a moment a documentary on my guest president
