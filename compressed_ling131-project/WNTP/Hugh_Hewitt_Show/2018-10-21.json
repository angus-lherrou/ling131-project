{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "And uh and again why do you go through will do this um I think partly out of spite\nUm but also uh to to put a marker down to force the legislative Republicans to make some compromise somewhere else to buy back and what that meant that attitude that approach\nIs is just so wrong headed that we need to have leaders who won Pennsylvania to be able to earn this kind of private sector investment because you know I said all the time but you got to keep in mind we live in a world where talent and capital is more mobile than it has ever been\nAnd that people can choose to go wherever they think that they're going to get the best\nShot at a at success and so you know the attitude in Harrisburg too often as well so long as we're not quite so bad as New York and New Jersey that were okay and that's not that's not true we need Pennsylvania to compete with the high performing states with the Indiana's and the and the north Carolina's and and the Texas is the winning Pennsylvania\nTo be one of those top performers because if we if we don't we don't aspire to excellence what happens is and this has been Pennsylvania's experience for decades that we only ever grow at a fraction of\nThe national average even when we're in positive territory other states are moving ahead farther and faster than we are and so over time this you know this compounds itself\nThat uh you know this is why we have stagnant uh a job growth and wage growth of population growth because people you know ultimately they go to where the opportunities are both more plentiful in more promising so yeah Harrisburg needs an attitude adjustment\nWe need leaders at the top who are looking at big bold reforms that will unlock the promise of Pennsylvania right we need policies that make sure that every single individual every single community and every single business across the commonwealth is free to thrive\nAnd we don't have that right now to your point David you know Congress passed a a tax reform bell that saved the legislature in terms of having to deal with\nA budget death on the other day and advertising the first thing that happens is the governors that you know what we're going to take away some of these wins that you've out from Washington ah because I Can't see the forest through the trees here so we need that kind of big bold bold vision and citizens\nTalk about it when I travel across the state you know we're missing opportunity here for every single citizen to have their greatest chance to thrive\nAnd that involves having a business climate that gets are entrepreneurs are innovators are small businesses are large businesses looking forward to their own big bold vision or to create the kind of economic environment that can only make life better here\nYeah and I really hope that this experience that we've had as a result of the federal tax cuts and motivate some Pennsylvania leaders like you said too I and I don't know about you Everytime I Try to have a discussion about tax cuts they talk about how much is it going to cost [noise]\nUm well we're what we're seeing now is that the economy grows when you cut taxes and um we don't need to talk about um cuts when we talk about um you know cut the budget when we're talking about tax cuts because we need to look long time that the economy is going to grow which is in fact what happened\nSo every time I have a discussion in Harrisburg about cutting taxes I Hope to answer from now on isn't going to be well let's find where we're going to cutting the budget so laugh and he's\n... we're talking about reducing tax rates we're not talking about reducing tax collection and in fact that the opposite is true that the by the by reducing the baseline costs of creating and keeping jobs in Pennsylvania\nA and whether that's through tax relief or regulatory reform or limits on lawsuit abuse or modernizing workers' comp unemployment ... they are all kinds of ways that state government could help\nTo reduce the baseline cost cutting in keeping jobs that wins state government does that it improves the environment for investment and as a result you get\nMore of that dynamism you get the willingness of people to take risks to start their own small business and and that's actually one of the key indicators the concert everyone is the Pennsylvania is a small business start operate is totally anemic\nWere one of the worst states for um for family and it's a small business startups um math I think I saw me right now the number five worst business to a state to start a business that this new good\nThat's a designation that you don't want a half\nAnd that's not an environment for population growth that's an environment for young entrepreneurs young innovators people looking to start their own path forward to leave here and go someplace else we want to keep them here\nAnd that's exactly right in Pennsylvania is our home and and we want to have the best possible a chance to to succeed uh and and to see that prosperity not just for ourselves but for the next generation will\nI Want to thank both of you so much for being

T. Q. person to win a seat in the U.S Senate\nThe thirty year old Harris challenge three term democratic Senator Tom Carper of Delaware and our ads however Harris ran as an air force veteran who served their country in the middle east after nine eleven\nYet another is Mikey Cheryl a female Naval Academy graduate who flew helicopters in the middle east she's running and New Jersey's ... district eleven talk show host Andrew willpower who lives in that Republican district marvels at how one could watch ad after advice Cheryl and never learned she's running as a Democrat\nSo the Democrats find guys like the Nickelodeon lambda try to win conservative districts like those of ...\nAnd then on a dime they flip the switch to run socialist like Ocasio Cortez and some early and Sarah ... auto and they're super liberal city districts in between they nab candidates like Kerri Evelyn Harris and Mike is Cheryl I asked the Democratic party have you know principals\nActually they do while they have one overriding principal or I should say purpose to win and secure power and then above all they hope to achieve the added purpose of impeaching Donald Trump\nFor American radio journal I'm Paul ... check out my latest book up hoping the president on John Paul the second in Ronald Reagan\nIf you miss hearing Lincoln radio journal on your favorite radio station audio of our complete program is available on our Web sites Lincoln radio journal dot com and Lincoln Institute dot org\nFor twenty three years later and radio journal has been heard on public affairs minded radio stations throughout the commonwealth including WC E.

FM in Danville along with W W easy up em in Elizabeth town Pennsylvania\nBut none more than Missouri doesn't come a Democrat Claire McCaskill wants to hang on to her seat against her very able challenger Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley my colleague Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project maritime\nThis time keeps investigated team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign\nWe've got the news because Claire McCaskill\nCharged responded to our hidden camera investigation she attacked a video of course she made a false statement in this state that she put out a she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Paul II\nHad brought you normally embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct I had nothing to do with Josh all that never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved with the ...\nAnd just to your listeners know our investigation Claire McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her an McCaskill on the bottles policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that uh other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles and McCaskill herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be a gun than the sum type so the capitals not just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only does the staff or talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talk about handguns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets into the Senate will vote with the so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there's the red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not leftist their their their moderate the pro life pro gun Democrats it's the only thing in Missouri do than these like state so whether it's investigating exposures that in order to get elected\nIn order to get elected you have to lie to people and that's what all staffers are saying he's saying the moderates we'll just have to get over being allied can very devastating very powerful I mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because it involves a sitting\nUS Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling or wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill response James okay well it is some startling that Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently in betting on me and my campaign\nUm he's the attorney general of the famous Harry he's supposed to be going after fraud not participating in it [laughter]\nSo um there was nothing there have been very upfront about all my positions I made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment really telling about this is how far they're willing to go too far jointly embed somebody in my campaign\n[noise] well first of all it does it mean to own faith lie categorically unequivocally falls\nJosh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I've never met him and she didn't live on local TV in Missouri Larry what's gonna happen next to this other Senate candidate John always say that had\nNothing to do with it chicken after respond to that so I think we're or cheating our goal of holding people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nHurricane and ravaged the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly unpredictable so that does now past thirty Kendall air force base near Panama City took a serious and it's one of the size of our elite after twenty two fighter jets whites anyone concerned with our nation's fighting ability to be concerned about that\nI turn to a regular on my program Congress remind Gallagher of the house armed services committees are defence expert at a Marine Corps intelligence veteran himself\nBut get right down to it the danger zone has receded according to I'm reading a real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will hurt Andy Barr Mike Bost Rodney Davis Brian Mast John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory\nIt if we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and very sound pretty optimistic it on hold the house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party offices we have around my district or northeast Wisconsin which in an upsurge in volunteers coming in people coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful\nThe signs and ask what can I Do to help so I Do sense they light momentum shift I always thought this was going to be a nice that when we talk about control the house you know five seats one way or the other ... but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats from Democrats in Minnesota and that the Democrats are pulling out\nOf a couple of states that look you'd be training in our direction so again we got to run through that you have this you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down the candidate quality and sort of that twenty to thirty states that we are talking about here [laughter]\nSorry let me talk to you about some defense so she was first of all the F twenty two at ten dull a it's a murky picture or I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt that bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe a danger to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment at why by the way do we keep at twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell and trying to read through that and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask\nThe hard questions of the deed figure out what exactly happened it seems like Seventeen twenty accuser damage I think ten of those are cats in the storm rated hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus mile per hour winds and seven of the seven of the Seventeen were in Leicester rented hangers\nI think it's important to note that no one thought this would be a fortified little bird imported our prior I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here um but the planes are based in those so that they can have access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want a budget that twenty two going into super cruise over Kansas is too disturbing to the local community\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country so as best I can tell him talking to officials plugging experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired\nBut the problem here is the skin on the plane there's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive and my understanding of the missile site survey suggests that the air frame\nAppear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back on track but repairing the skin um will be a very expensive proposition finally I just stay out of your question\nYou know why we're so many their ground\nThis goes back really to the Obama administration decision to halt the program that you down to nine factory gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on the air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so\nWe had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground in the first place with their engines pulled it because of the lack of spare parts\nAnd a lack of train people to repair that President doing we're the job campaign when candidates in vulnerable critical house and Senate races in Ohio he took time to praise the work of some of America's political and military heroes who hail from mistake\nTo salute the civil war general Ulysses Grant was preceded by the mention of grants number one\nBlurry older shows a medium as users soundbites to paint Trump is a racist\nTrump is being criticized for praising General Robert we\nSay that gave us a great president who has been properly recognized OK William McKinley he has not been properly records it also gave you\n[noise] have general [noise] who is incredible he drank a little bit too much [noise]\nYou know what I'm Talking about [noise] still Robert\nDaly was a great general\nCan you hear that he says so Robert he went to great general\n[noise] though Robert\nDaly was a great general she got that [noise]\nPan [noise] Abraham Lincoln develop a phobia\nHe couldn't be Robert ... he was going crazy I don't know if you know the answer but Robert Daly was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln gamma reason I can be really\nAnd one day it was really bad and like you just said you\nHardly knew his name\nAnd they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem [noise]\nAnd I said I don't care what probably as you guys aren't women [noise]\nAnd his name was grant general [noise]\nAnd\nHe went in and he's not a lot of ... [noise]\nHe started\nTo win grant really did he had a serious problem is serious drinking problem but man was he a good general and he's finally being recognized as a great you know [noise] but\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared it's intelligent Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me\nThat they are in possession of audio and maybe a video of from inside the conflicts showing who did what in the ... you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence counterparts who often work very closely with the Turks\nThen that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on the U.S\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared\nReally All right now does it impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stressors Jordan and Egypt in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to construct ... sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome a as being a necessary course correction in the middle east\nUh I'm not sure they had any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish tennis whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis began to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accept certain moves on because it as an exotic story and read like a trailer I'm Jamal Shelby has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this\nAbove the fold for very long David Kirkpatrick\nYeah I think they tried to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is with elite opinion you know look at Wall Street and Silicon Valley uh she's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and they're no out to help diversify the Saudi economy\nHe's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia\nOver the not too long term has got some real issues in terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nListen to the entire interview with New York times reporter David Kirkpatrick on channel review dot com coming off\nLast Monday I got a closer eye cancer he said to me to be honest I don't understand their against him and I have to be sensitive to that\nGod

learned\nDoctrine without hearing a personal word [noise] see you can learn\nAll the Bible and not be changed by it [noise] you can be a Bible scholar and make no difference in your life because the relationship with the Holy Spirit is not fair\nAnd if the tree guy off the page and play\nSays that God might write his law\n[noise] football\nIs a rule book this one book come down from the link often and then the fabric of the rules by which\nFootball game is to be played by the rules of standards for every team and every play offs to alcohol Willie\n... is one book\nThat covers the\nGames are paying the players\nThe Bible\nIs dogs\nBook [noise] in in the standard\nBy which every Christian Christians are to base meditations on when\nYou have to make a decision on the football field they do\nBased on both\nSometimes you see them getting a little circle and having\nOther gosh and in light\nOn the field what the rule book saying because bad decisions must be based on the\nBook is banned in for everybody\n[noise] has a book\nEvery team have old\n[noise] the\nThe team is going on in light of the battle on the field that they're\nFacing now we the poor little changes every week based on who they're playing they come up with\nWant in light of the team they're playing\nNever changes that standard across the line but the point folks shifts Washington is no playbook ship for the game the playbook chips with him again\nBecause of the things happen to change their approach if they're losing too much like I thought passing a law when they were planning to do some run because the situation has changed so much sitting up walking\nHe's called coordinate I look at all would have to check what's going on and when something happening that ... votes for what\nAnd spring comes into my\nAnd say here's what\nChanged the play is John\n[noise] the Bible and dog\nOn the whole it's burned gives you you're playing\nAgainst you but you're supposed\nTo speak and to you\nThe individual decisions you make with your life\nBook but be running the wrong place [noise]\nRead that\nBecause you're not into\nLike real quick I'm not sure\nThat he can can change things you plan\nThat today but he says no no no don't do that because if you're going to see if you used to hearing your voice [noise] become very good relationship with the Holy Spirit [noise]\nSo here's the question [noise] how often would you need to hear his voice [noise]\nWell you would need to hear his voice damn well wait a minute if ministry until the lord\nLet you hear his voice\nAnd you need to hear his voice every day for the planes you might call for that day that may not be minutes into the on daily [noise]\nWhich if you wash up on Sunday [noise]\n[noise] so you have to live is why we got the spring and the Monday through Saturday we\n[noise] every\nBuilding has a receiver to pick up a signal from happening so you can see a clear picture\nOwners and he says you all have been known to let me tell you how powerful the only thing is when you're worship leads you to a relationship with the Holy Spirit your annoying it's so powerful that he goes on and saying first John chapter too so that you don't need any non Christian to teach you any more [noise]\nOn my TV hip I\nTV receiver [noise] I'm\nThe church on Sunday about\nIs living on human opinion man way that kinda makes you wonder\nHe calls it the annoying thing where God wants to and brings clarity in our lives\n... chapter six versus one day [noise] let me tell you about Isaiah says in the year the king is I and\nI [noise] I've\n[noise] there was when he thought the thing that was in control wasn't around\nOf a human being human circumstances died\nHad human things your banking on the dial on you a situation that didn't come through for you well we'll look for God when something die\nBecause of the year then can you buy a dollar\nDay I saw the real king on the throne\n[noise] and he thought that if you have to\nTo fill the temple that dog ate overpaying holy\nArm is going to be filled with the glory and many\nThe angels after they worship him into the author\nWood fire watching us now and he came and took the\nDon't know if I'm a drunk something to your lips\nSometimes ever Thomas Joanna\nYou and your daughters rebel jumps in my little unclean but the angels were going to the altar clinging to live and\nAnd say you never knew and when it for my sins\nMissing Somali\nHe was going to have\nFor you what do you remember\nTo see how how the challenge of truth gets under the skin of those who knows they don't know the very\nTruth they are encountering we're not going to be surprised when our friends and neighbors wander eventually just throws out frankly we ought to get thrown out a lot more than we do many of us\nAnd the reason we are not throwing out the reason we're accepted maybe because we are more represented by the fear of the parents than we are represented in the face of the main ones blind we're ready to find\nThe question well I don't know about that oh I'm not so sure about that well maybe you could ask someone else about that law and have the courage of your convictions\nHow dare you lecture us You're gone and they threw him out\nNow let's just pause for a moment and think about this man\nI when I was born in a story I I I just sat\nSaying to myself what incredible few hours or a couple of days however long has recorded here it was in the life of this man this is not\nNot an inventive story this is an historical narrative this is an encounter with genes are there is one of the science that has been placed in the gospels so that as a result of seeing the sign men and women might believe that Jesus Christ the son of God and then I buy the lead and they might have life and his name so this man stands as assigned to it\nWhat it means to be spiritually blind and how we need Jesus to make us see in the same way that he needed Jesus to restore his physical site what it means for him\nHe must have awakened to are fairly normal day I Would imagine a routine for him would either to lead or to go buy his routine path to his place of begging and there he would sit and make the usual thousands and listen for the passers by in the hope that it would be a good day\nLooking at him as he sits there having never seen the sun's riser said over the seal guy let me look at him as he is identified slowly and specifically by his predicament\nHe is a blind man he is a beggar\nWas the aware I asked myself off his becoming the focus of the conversation as inverse too because if you have friends who are blind I'm not sure blinders even politically correct anymore but\nBelieve me there is no use of the verb\nWith any pejorative aspect to it so I have to stick with it 'cause I don't know what the politically correct thing is that you can you ... site impaired or something\n[noise] and\nIf you have friends who are blind you know that there are sensors almost inevitably are heighten their other senses their sense of a fragrance their sense of sound their sense of hearing their sense of touch their sense of taste\nThey are able to teach those of us who can see a ton of stuff that we don't see even though we can see it therefore it is not difficult for us to imagine that as the men sits there his ears pay top stuff\nDid he hear somebody say who send\nThis man or his parents and did he say to himself I Wonder if they're only ... I Wonder if they're asking about\nMe and then the ... then he says oh they are asking about me who send this matter as parents that that he was born blind or they are talking about\nMe I don't know what I Wonder who they're asking and then they answered neither ... nor his parents Simon said well that's passing but\nThis happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life can you imagine sitting there trying to think yourself then do it you know been\nBlind since you're ... you're sitting on the side of the road is something new routine to Europe bender and suddenly you're the focal point of the conversation and whoever it is that as an ... says\nThe blindness blameless that I Know is there in order to do the work of God might be displayed in his life can you imagine him saying I Wonder what that means I Wonder what that is going to mean\nAnd then he hears this that and then\nAnd then whoever this individual is says to him I'm going to put it that much on your ice\n\nWould you said okay go ahead\nUnless you inherit the dialogue before you see the words of Christ given basis to the works of crisis\nThe work of Christ was an evidence of the world you've spoken he said this is in order to do the work of God might be displayed in his life now that says the work of God the man is its submit to this and does his he's told\nAnd he comes back seeing what an incredible story and then to his parents\nAnd then for the community all the confusion and enter the religious leaders he's a walking medical he's a challenge to the religious foreign to listen and then they attempt to the fire ceased to intimidate him despite what he knows to be true he gives as good as he got\nBecause these individuals' these religious formulas couldn't wouldn't believe their eyes\nDon't tell me that you can't believe tell me that you won't believe\nTell me that you won't\nBecause there is enough evidence of the living God in creation and in your life and in your ... very sense of moral arguments\nAs to condemn you for your own belief in God that is not enough in nature to save you but there is nothing major to condemn you do not telling me you can see tell me you won't see\nThat is what is pointed out here that is what has made so graphically clear\nAnd John and somebody said in a couple of chapters later in John chapter twelve summarizes the response of these Jews and he says in verse thirty seven of John twelve even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence they still would not believe in him\nThey still would not believe in him\nIt wasn't the absence of evidence it wasn't the absence of good evidence it wasn't a compelling nature of the truth that they confronted they flat out refuse\nTo believe in him and he's been thrown out now why do you must have said to him self what do you do now\nHe knew what it wants to operate as a blind man but he had not no track record or seeing man\nOr I pictured him in my mind's eye\nWalking away from this a confrontation with the religious leaders I saw him walk out into his community\nHe was in the crowd\nBut his whole existence have been defined by his blindness walking down the street like a like a sheep without a shepherd almost\nThere what do you needed was a shepherd not look at verse thirty eight which is the end of the same time the beginning for a long introduction resident Jesus' hair that they had thrown him out\nAnd when he found him when he found to\nSee Jesus is about to identify himself in the very next chapter is open on the page beside you as a good shepherd what a shepherd is do they seek out cheap Jesus is identified and looks gospel chapter Nineteen as the son of man who came seeking to save those that were\nLost\nOn ask the man had been healed on saw the man had been found and Jesus finds him in order that he might confront him with is most important question\nAnd when he found him he said do you believe in the son of man the question I Want to leave and your mind because this is the great question do you believe\nIn the son of mine's son of mine is a self designation for ... for the price for the savior\nDo you believe in Jesus the nature of I Believe the significance of that belief the some in some sense of I Believe it's far more than an intellectual awareness of the existence of Jesus of now is that it it means the\nCasting of myself upon it means the line with myself upon it means in trusting all my life and all of my attorney the into the hands of Jesus of Nazareth believing that he is the person that he

do not see the devil or in the language of William Still an old Scottish minister one\nOf those yet so welcome parts in the story very very early on genesis chapter three the very beginning of the

gone so there's this Invisible War going on all of the time the devil is not prominence for the rest of the Bible he's not mentioned but he is every where president\nBill tells us New Testament rights
