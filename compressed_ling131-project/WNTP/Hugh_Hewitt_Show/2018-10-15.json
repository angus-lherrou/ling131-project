secretary of defense Mattis and it's important to refer to ... because he was a civilian job\nHas to look at losing Seventeen twenty twos\nLet's say who is that on\nWho is responsible for that that is a ... that is a\nStrategic why is\nThat the idea of Seventeen after twenty two fighters they are not stop all\nThey are not they are our front line of defense it's it's just a match unable that they left on the air force base\nAnd service culture and accountability in the navy fired five senior admirals last year over three collisions and the grounding\nSenior animals that navies\nA culture of a

hurt\nIf you listen closely he will also give you leads but but yeah the unfortunate dynamic in the blue bubble newsrooms is if you don't interrupt them you're seen to have been a roll over what in

to strike\nA being someone who can be both in the ... camp but also work with and then they go she ate or try to have some kind of agreement with the Europeans just not working as an appetite against globalization and the ranks of the conservative party they won it there's a heart attack that I mean the barrage\nBlock of the Tory party is really the heart and soul the Tory party and there's still a lot of anger about Theresa May what she's trying to do to maybe salvage the relationship with Europe rather than moving away\nThe I Would watch that story very closely on to another story and I I think this has implications for last night's interview when the president brought up secretary of defense Mattis suggested maybe he's not long for the administration\nRobert I Am stunned there were Seventeen twenty choose left behind and Kendall air force base their presumed damaged at least and perhaps destroyed they can't get into the hangar that's eight percent of our strategic weapon our number one the greatest fighter ever made we only have two hundred of 'em or something like that\nThere will be accountability here is this going to be the occasion for the secretary of defense to fall in the store and say a buck stops with me I run the department of defense does planes were my watch and Mr President here's my resignation\nSecretary Mattis has signaled to a lot of\nPeople inside of the Pentagon and the administration that he's probably going to eat after the terms that this is someone who's on his way out though this whole situation with with the planes it could be the winner but it's always been really heading for the exit and the president kind of like a Democrat on sixty minutes\nWas revealing it as a secretary of defense is really worn out his welcome highly respected by the president and others ... but not the one who's going\nFor your secretary of defense he's also a huge proponent of accountability and they they fired five senior admirals last year over collisions and grounding and I think this is a way for him to send a message about accountability that it's just a huge strategic blow to the United states ... the early reporting is correct [noise]\nLet me move to Maggie Haberman you mad you know the president about as well as anyone and she interviewed a bunch of rally at tenders a four story yesterday\nAbout why they loved Trump and then there are four things quote he wins regardless of how fungible the definition of winning maybe he takes the directly to Democrats unlike previous Republican presidential candidate to prefer comedy ever controversy\nHe does not about a politically correct culture and he does not condescend to them tend to quote\nIt is that last thing Robert concept that I think is so critical people really resent the blue bubbles of Manhattan and Washington Silicon Valley in Hollywood they really have gotten the sense\nIn the first man plop the movie flopping confirms that send me the elites do not know or care about them your comment\nI saw her and why it I mean the I thought it was a really inspiring film or about the country and about\nThe space program that was very accurate in about ... is the courage it took to go to space uh but I guess that there were different issues surrounding that film and\nThe American flag and different things that I Do it not being successful at the box office ah but I think you're right Maggie ... story is strong and that it shows that I was just on on the trail with the president last week I was on air force one in Erie, Pennsylvania\nAnd at the rally she's the crowds are still there and he is an answer for years and they see him is for all its problems controversy that he has been gone swam in their eyes and he's still a thorn in the side of the establishment and that really more than any ideology is what seems to attract them and President Trump\nYes yes he hasn't gone swamp by the way that is a great phrase I I Will give you credit for that he hasn't gone swap I Know here it pretty well that's where I went to summer camp and kept Notre Dame and it's a\nIt's a part of the land part of the northeastern Ohio western Pennsylvania beaver falls Joe name as you named Bernie ... is our land and they love Trump I mean they just I Can't stay how much he loved in my home town of war in Ohio but I'll talk to you about first\nFirst man plop a Robert written Neil Armstrong grew up in Hollywood and born there but he grew up there and I really was looking forward to I Will not see a movie that does not show Armstrong the iconic moment that picture we all know of him planting the flag they made an artistic choice\nBy of and two hundred about that choice a decision to serve the world rather than the American audience and history and therefore I'm not going to support it and I think no means of Americans into it at the same I guess it's sort of contempt for our intelligence do they not we will react this way\nSpeaking here I I was\nI saw the movie and having not seen any article about American Pie controversy that not showing Armstrong why\nThey do show the flag on the moon I guess they don't show Armstrong putting it into the ground on the moon I thought the whole movie was about American perseverance and grit and so I was actually kind of stunned when I saw that a lot of people will say oh we'll never see the film\nI thought the film was terrific but I I understand I guess now looking but there were some that that's not\nThere's not that scene at the flag being put in the ground but I don't know you I mean it's a good movie but I\nI'm a moviegoer and sunny bunch says it's a wonderful movie reviewer right at the Washington Free beacon a great man and he is with you that I'm a lunatic pronouncing it but I Am into it and how can you take the central moment that it is the iconic picture why would you exclude that Robert and I would expect\nThe president to eventually get around that is why would they exclude that planting the flag because it's a moment of American trial and went through trial\nI I I I'm Still surprised by that controversy because\nThe movie shows the flag in the moon just not the plant you know the flag\nWas not like the whole thing about the American space program at all the whole movie is about the uh the American flags everywhere throughout the whole\nPie I Would I don't understand the\nFilmmakers news caused such a feud started the whole movie almost\nPatriotic team it does not have that that scene\nBecause it makes sense like that because you're you're really preventing a film from having traction\nSo easily preventable so predictable and yet\nArrogant to continue on in the face of the controversy which has been six weeks and like I could have cut it in I mean it just wouldn't have been hard let me talk to a little bit about it ... what's coming ahead or in these elections as I read\nThe tea leaves in Ohio and probably going to Tampa on Thursday talking to people across the country I've got Kramer winning in North Dakota Holly winning in Missouri Braun tied in Indiana Scott winning in Florida Rosendale creeping up on and going to be assisted by the president black burns pulled away and Sally is pulled away Heller is I had\nThis could be a great night for the Republicans in Twenty one days in a day Robert Costa in the Senate do agree with my assessment as it stands right now\nI have a slight disagreements about such a competent production I have a story in the front page of today's post that rent a bit of caution for Republican in Senate races in the mid west in what Lou Barletta\nRunning as many drowned them Pennsylvania struggling against Bob casey in Michigan Republicans are struggling in Ohio Sherrod Brown looks like he's on the way to re election Tammy Baldwin Wisconsin ... vulnerable months ago she seems like she's on pace to probably win Wisconsin\nAnd so it ruined the tests are still pretty tough candidate I think you're right about North Dakota that's probably it looks like it's gone a\n... I I think the Republicans have to find a way in the mid west to get some of the Trump like candidate come across the finish line I mean the president has his agenda that voters or their their their their enthusiastic but at the bar letters of the world and the leaves you're still ten points back\nYeah the I've been told that the ... is not right that Walker got a little bit of a leading these pulling her up but that general you're right Rosendale is not a hat and test to interpret land yet but he's getting the right direction and the cabinet or this is my last question Robert costs I don't know if you talked about it on Washington we can review on friday night\nIt's a defining moment in American politics it really did remind everyone that there are two parties not just Trump and everybody else but there they Republican Party ... and it stands for the judges and it stands for cabinet and Gorsuch had they did not like that at all they they reject\nThe ... you know the job

I had had a larger instead of working with that guy is that their home states it's tied appropriate at national nominee or they can see the ...\nStay with California had a senator white Democrats\nAnd two senators particularly who has that leaders of the resistance and it turns out these judicial bias we're talking with Diane Feinstein who of course if that had Democrat on the set of judicial committee and come on I ... through the new member of the Judiciary Committee but also as a as a\nAs a leader among the last um and the and the\nPresident and potential presidential contender in twenty twenty the White House have held off on their aid agencies much used the frustration of conservative such as yourself and I'm finally what happened you know the than the Kavanaugh up I was over and last week he thought those three vacancies\nUp with nominate put forward and we heard very clear from Democrats from from Colorado Harris at a at that and find that you are not the nominees that that consulted with the White House thought what was that I like all the names of what was the coach someone someone that\nThe Democratic senators and the judge said who it up during the Obama administration said that day and\nThe two senators thought these were consensus packs\nAt the White House disagreed and they put the nominees forward and how far they than\nI think that there's not a lot of I'm less and less than a year um will be interesting to watch as well because I you know the candidates out until after the election a lame duck I'm not quite sure you can push through all those nominees in a matter of the week but we'll have\nThere are twenty nine confirmed federal circuit judges already under ... on the Trump and there are twelve or Thirteen more pending and I believe at least a half dozen of them will get through I bet you're Mitch wants to get to forty but up to your point\nI had been told that Andy guilt bird was going to be a Ninth Circuit judge Eddie go for it as a friend of mine and he's my age would be a little bit older than the normal the sixty one or maybe sixty Robin but he would have been a little older than the normal uh appeals court judge but everybody loves ... he's a great judge and\nI understand he was going to be nominated by I'm Wondering if they\nIn response to Feinstein's attempts to take out of cabinet that that basically burn there is no bridge the ... but there was a bridge to find science do you think have you heard if that's what happened that they just said screw this you're going to pull this stuff on cabinet we're not\nPlaying chess with you on the Ninth Circuit\nI don't have definitive reporting in that sense but I think you can either you know the timeline of events and that that's fair conclusion to drive because I had gotten her party earlier in the year I Believe back in April about the struggles of the White House during those times that if they could be the sources at that time told me that while I'm\nThe why they'd been stricken has ignored the blues but boost the tradition\nI suffer all their circuit they can see that we see David traffic they there could be one of the more prominent example that up in Minnesota they there was a different situation when it came to find time because she was really a democratic senator thought she was the leader of the Judiciary Committee and you know there is a certain deference there now\nAnd the fact that you know you know ... you have to as Senator Chuck Grassley has to push the nominee but he does great good working relationship with the anti inside\nBut there are a lot of these dynamics that play that fact that you thought that the White House you know kind of defiantly release the greed out and he said that I stuck it out on yet just days after the bruising fight with a with judge Kavanaugh and that\nI think that's a sign that says but you know we try to you know you know they're they're thinking that look we tried to work with the two Democratic senators were clearly not going to land on nominees there'll be agreed with and the White House either like how many people who they the fat and they just look for a while but\nI also think that the improving prospects of a\nNot only retaining but increasing the Republican majority in the Senate are involved in the White House I'm Talking with them and can you ought to be falling or on Twitter as the EU and G.

to go for it and and forest Feldman was Chicago\nI'm reporting now that senior members of the department of justice are planning on a transition that\nThat Jeff Sessions is not going to make it to the new year I don't know what their that's their just planning on it and that means they got to find a new attorney general I'm writing for the post about it this week I think it should be Michael ... and but I'm reporting that they're planning on the transition I Do not have reporting that the White House as a preferred candidate do you\nAh have reporting segment on on who will replace Jeff Sessions'\nJob but I think there's a transit is that we've actually thinking for a long time because of that one of the vote the dark I traced back to the president's relationship with his attorney general a former Senator Jeff sessions to lead\nA horse Donald Trump when he was a presidential candidate he tried to hide it turns out that they have probably the the most toxic relationship within the administration\nBut the comment because again we'll have to wait and see what the results aren't that November ... election after Republicans retain control of the ... or pick up a\nDiet and attorney general after ... ... ... with all the dynamics around the nomination not only the fact that the attorney general is generally I can touch at the high profile nomination\nBut I mean the other Russia that as soon as that continues ethics that they're going to be pretty hard to find out on at I think that it's hard to see at this point um and we've got the senators say\nWe're not quite sure who can get for this device that environment and you actually have one senator\nSenator Ben Sasse who's on the district many a Republican from Nebraska when's the last ... ah you know the spray between at President Trump and Jeff Sessions blew up in the public that that made it clear that he has not confirmed any\nUm any replace efforts I shouldn't that be that comes from the fact that sessions has fired you see some resistance even Republicans about that relationship and potentially who could take over\nUm but I think that we've been kind of being a duck passions effect but it's for a while I'm ... years is not an abnormal attack right attorney general they'll just have to raise the um but I think everybody has pretty much expecting him to a you know read the article at the door\nAnd and I think people have to be aware that if the\nAttorney general resigns or is fired the vacancy act exists and they can move Alexander's are over there for a total of four hundred days you can nominate Michael ... or anybody else Henry says so point them\nWhen the Senate leaves if they're nominated before the Senate leaving before the end of this Congress that can be appointed during

is\nIt's wonderful to talk with you again I think that ... cabinets going to move the Supreme Court further to the right I think there's a number of issues where he's going to be more conservative than Anthony Kennedy I think these include abortion rights affirmative action\nGay and lesbian rights criminal punishments and civil rights I think we've moved from Anthony Kennedy being the median Justice John Roberts being the median justice and all the years I mentioned John Roberts is to the right of Anthony Kennedy\nSo I'm John Eastman there's also the rule of four or with a predictable

terms with cases the court's gonna take justice is only want to take a case where they have a choice if they think that they're likely to win that there's some instances where there's realistically no choice if a lower court strikes\nDown a federal statutes Supreme Court is going to take the case is a significant split among the circuits the Supreme Court's gonna take the case but I think you'll see the Supreme\nCourt even then turns it down and I think that's because there isn't confidence the fifth vote now the conservatives will have that confidence", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show",
