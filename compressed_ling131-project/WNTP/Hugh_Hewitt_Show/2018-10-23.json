immigration reform it is an extraordinarily important organization that really has their finger on the pulse of what's going on with respect to the ... now the caravan is the lead story of the morning without question and a and that includes last night's massive rally in Texas for Ted Cruz\nA held by the president of the United states did you see\nNot just how many people were there but there was ongoing coverage throughout the day yesterday on Fox News and in other places of the thousands and\nThousands of people who waited in line overnight some for twenty four maybe even pushing up to thirty six hours\nTo get in to hear the president in Texas a rallying for Ted Cruz last night and oh by the way what do you know what a strange strange sight to see you know it was only two short years ago maybe two and a half a\nA little bit I guess when you go back to the summer of twenty sixteen and the primary season in the in the spring of irks me some are twenty fifty and then the primary season in the spring of twenty sixteen when\nDonald Trump and Ted Cruz we're not exactly sharing stages together in warm embrace a lying to head the calls and accusations of you know National Enquirer stories about a a Ted Cruz's father and related to JFK and animal or you know these\nAre all of these kinds of strange things but I'll tell you what nothing like two years of Democrat insanity to bring former political rivals together in common cause\nAnd at the end of the day that's what this is that's what this was\nThe president of United States last night rally in for and he's done this with others to\nYou know President Trump and Lindsey Graham didn't always get along very closely as you know Lindsey Graham was more closely aligned with one of President Trump's fiercest critics the late John McCain\nBut it's amazing what the Democrats can do for Republican unity and unification simply by being well very democratic and that's wrong way say but being very Democrat\nAnd that's essentially what has happened last night so the president of the United states last night a rallying for Ted Cruz and they came out by the thousands and thousands of people seem to at least ... people the media\nThe media the left\nDemocrats whatever you want to call them and kind of it's kind of all one in the same those are all synonymous with one another the media and the Democrats and the left are literally all synonymous with one another they want to say that these are Trump crowds are overblown\nThey tell you this bronco Obama held a rally in California a short while ago filled with about three million just to just the the area in the county he was in about three million very very blue voters it's a very blue district hip seven hundred and fifty people come out to sea of\nPresident Trump has tens of thousands at all of these rallies there were always overflow crowds outside they're setting up big TV monitors\nYou know big screens for them to watch from the outside they just want to be a part of it and the reason why isn't just enthusiasm for what President Trump stands for\nIncluding his very strong statements yesterday about um about the caravan of about migrants that about securing our border and so on and so forth it's not they're not just rallying for what the president is preaching and what the president President is is I'm advocating\nIt's rallying against the tactics of the left rallying against the bullying rallying against the intimidation rallying against the harassment rallying against the physical battery and assault in some cases\nRoute rallying against um you know the media calling for these things rallying against the left a laughing when Republicans are treated in such ways\nI Know you played this yesterday bad boys and all he played a lot or yellowish yesterday and I'm surprised you didn't play the whole show an audio form because this voice was so bad and get well soon hopefully you are ah hopefully not listening right now you should be sleeping after a night in Pittsburgh God Bless ya\nUh but you should be sleeping but a Phillip range of course former Obama a W there is a deputy deputy assistant secretary of state\nUh on on MSNBC essentially mocking Mitch McConnell who was a\nBeing harassed in a restaurant the way Sarah Sanders has been harassed and restaurants the way so\nOthers have just been attacked or just for being Republicans just by rapid liberal protestors who listen to their masters on national television\nOnline they listen to note that while they can listen to their own um there are no Democrats elected positions or other well respected positions of authority calling for an end to the harassment in the intimidation\nThere are no no one is calling for an end to this\nHave you heard Nancy Pelosi have you heard Chuck Schumer the two ranking members of Congress for the Democrats have you heard any of the more popular\nOr Democrats or who are kind of in the news you know the Elizabeth Warren's the Cory bookers the Kamala Harris says have you heard any of them denouncing Maxine Waters and those who would call for more violence intimidation and harassment of Republicans no\nThey're not saying anything former President Obama who is still revered by the left\nIs he's speaking out and saying no stop this this is not what it's about we don't win in the streets by by uh intimidating harassing and and and quite frankly battering people in certain circumstances we don't win that way we went up the ballot box no\nNone of them are saying this instead they're on television law allowing the media and people like Philip brains using the media to call for more of this and guess what it has done\nIs this rally those thousands of people to all of these places where the president is holding rallies by the thousands the you know the kennel get him to start enough seats and yet they're willing to sit outside for twenty four hours there for thirty six hours\nHe'll getting like there were at a at a football game just on the chance that they can get in and if they can't get in then they'll cheer from the outside of the venue like they did last night last night down in Houston\nThat's that's not just pro Trump that's rebelling against the insanity of the left that's rebelling\nAgainst the coals for violence and the lack of calls for civility that's what's happening so the president of the United states really found a a tremendous you know has found really a tremendous rallying cry you know and and that is against what the Democrats he latched\nOn to something I Know he didn't coin it but a lot of people are truly brought into play and the president seems to have embraced it and that is jobs not mobs Democrats if you vote Democrat it brings you mobs if you vote Republican the president has taken a saying now that brings you jobs\nAnd he's a hundred percent right over four million jobs created since he took over and of course the lowest unemployment rate we've seen in this country in nearly what five decades literally five decades I Want to say goes back to Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nAh the lowest unemployment rate and of course the lowest all time unemployment rate for so many of those subgroups including African Americans Latino Americans are women and youth\nIn terms of unemployment rates so you\nBring your what do you want jobs are mobs and I think people are responding they're coming out to see the president if they're coming out to listen they're coming out to hear him rally not only for his policies and for you know a continuation of the tax cuts\nAnd the things that have a you know that a sport our economic growth to the level that it has but also for those members of Congress that need a little bit of a boost to make sure that we maintain the majority in both houses and also for those who are running new candidates who are running\nHis own party to keep control but he would be ... you know he would be bucking political history in the same way that he bucked up when he won the office of president in the first place it would just be an amazing thing\nBut at any rate the president last night obviously are spending a great deal of time talking about votes and voters in the United states and tying it\nThe caravans why and how quite simply because the Democrats are trying to import more

line that David M drunk or follow him at David M director David morning how are you\nI'm good how are you\nA fantastic thanks for the times of the press you know it's funny I started the show this morning\nTalking about it just seems like yesterday the president was calling Ted Cruz lie in bed and suggesting or a you know the national Enquirer suggesting that his father was complicit in the murder of JFK and all of these other things and it's amazing\nWhat a little bit of a democratic extremism can do to bring a political rivals together and last night they were embracing one another as if they were long lost friends\nDo you see that kind of unity happening just a you know on an on an individual or an anecdotal scale or is this widespread Republicans are all coming together to combat what they see is democratic extremism\nI don't know if I put it that way I mean I think that you have a lot of Republicans that were at odds with President Trump twenty sixteen that understand where their voters our number one Mm their voters like President Trump so arguing or being at arm's length President Trump when you're running for reelection in mid term election where you\nNeed Republican base turnout to begin with a ... that's not going to work or you know number number two\nI'm the president has been helpful in\nIn firing up the Republican base and especially the way politics has become so incensed Balkan eyes um and they're just there's not a lot of currency out there for um\nFor running a running intellectual especially in a red state like Texas and I could you know we could take off a list of red states where there are better do Senate races are potentially competitive Senate races it just doesn't do any good to 'em\nRun away from Trump so if you if you want to make sure that the turnout but you're going to need and if you want to make sure you're going to get a tournament you're going to campaign with the president and you're going to make nice looking up and I think it's just it's as simple as that\nYou know what ... David I'm director is our guest a buffer inserting a preview of that it's not so much just the the campaigning with the president and and being aligned with the president\nIs being United against the Democrats I feel like the Kavanaugh episode of this as late summer slashed ball a along with this caravan episode now it is it is driving a lot more unity among Republicans because they feel like the Democrats have just become so extreme\nAnd are basically resorting to any measures necessary to try to stop President Trump I feel like more than rallying for president it's rallying against that Democrats push and that's what they're trying to do\nWell so I think that if if you will get correct look I think they're trying to use those two episodes we know that have a lot of impact on Senate races you know it has an impact\nOn some house races and you know on the territory where you have solid Republican territory where Republican voters in this ... gauge dramatic place it and that's what happens but he called Washington it for all the White House in a midterm year I think having a kind of served to re engage Republicans and sort of wake up\nThe conservative base and and so I think that's a big part of it I just think that when you're when you're looking at a Republican like Ted Cruz\nWho had previously battle with the president and they didn't always get along and there are a number of Republicans in that boat if you look at senator Dean Heller in Nevada and then the calculation wasn't so much gee these Democrats really scare me I'm I'm going to be with Trump the calculation was\nThat I'm going to be with Trump because that's going to help me win because that's where my voters are and because fighting with a Republican president and find a Republican is it going to do me any good in the situation that I'm In\nI think with Kavanaugh and some of these other issues have done a native a little bit easier to unite with Trump from a policy perspective because it has put in the background maybe\nSome of those issues that were problematic about Trump in some of these states but I I Would contend in a state like you know and a senior Arizona Texas\nA North Dakota in Missouri and the best place you could have been all along is probably with President Trump\nDavid I'm drunk or is our guest a this morning on the Hugh Hewitt programs so the the ... let's talk about why people want to align with the president the president that it was supposed to be so unpopular the latest poll I think it was just yesterday NBC Washington are are are are not a washing the wall Street Journal poll\nShows him at forty seven percent which is a peak which is pretty amazing thing and when you compare it to a President Obama going into his first midterm in ... he was that around forty five forty six if I saw those numbers correctly yesterday\nHow do you explain that given the and I think you've seen the the same surveys done by the media Research Council and others that Ninety two percent of the press coverage for the president this entire summer has been negative Ninety two percent of stories including the word Trump had been negative yet he's up there at forty seven percent explain that\nRepublican voters just don't pay attention to news stories that in that regard I mean I I don't think it matters to Republican voter what are right or what anybody in the media\nRight it wasn't just a survey of Republican voters there was a survey of ...\nBob is doing ... minutes because if he got in mind veteran Mayfield early if he hadn't been such a Sam

there's started with two thousand and it's not what the seven thousand and by the time they reverse the one thousand miles they still have to go to get to the southern border of the United states it'll\nProbably go ten twelve Fifteen thousand whoa whoa whoa whoa we can't just take all of these people in we\nCan't just you know a release all of these thousands of people into the into the fabric of the continental United States of America on a wink and a nod promised that they'll come back for an actual am there are no asylum\nHearing at some point we can't do that and also why is that why is the overwhelming majority of these individuals who are in this caravan why are the men of working age because there aren't a ton of families according to those reporting from a you know that caravan\nThere aren't a ton of families it's mostly males of working age that are coming here are these people are really seeking asylum is there really something that terrible\nGoing on in the middle eastern Asia or Middle Eastern rather Central American nations although the president pointed out there are people from the middle east who have joined in as well remember our southern border is essentially a revolving door for people to come into the United states from not just Mexico or from Central America but quite frankly from all over the world\nBecause these other countries are not taking their sovereignty as seriously as we uh we would like to hear\nBut anyway [noise] all of the Central American migrants are being things really so bad in their countries that they need to seek asylum from persecution and fear that they face in their own countries is that really what this is about is this really humanitarian issue where these people are being persecuted and they cannot\nYou know they they cannot stay in their own countries without dieting\nWell let's put that to the test for a moment we'll give it a little credit to Fox News here and do a one of my listeners at my local show in Cleveland ah for sharing this with me this was a Fox News report from Sunday and I'm questions\nBy the reporter here from Fox News of a member of the caravan I think are extraordinarily revealing well the questions but moreover the answers are extraordinarily revealing I Want you to listen very carefully to what is really going on in this caravan of quote unquote migrants\nThat many of us believe are actually more like invaders trying to circumvent us immigration law please give us a list\nI can see as far as the eye can see I can see on during the immigrants headed north to the bus it through Honduras they went through about a mile and now they're trying to Capitol Hill right now they are in the north of that river\nNorth of the bridge that you saw people on yesterday so last night people got frustrated found a bridge Mexico's process about six hundred and forty people can get a visa for potentially asylum here could forty five Ninety Days apricot process they weren't worth it so last night in\nAcross the river swimming people came in droves I had to see maybe two hundred immigrants last night maybe in a thirty minute time\nProcessing the river coming here and now you see them now and I said they're going to be as a caravan me claim and they're on their way to a town called ... we're right now about twenty miles north of that river\nGoing ... right now some of the people here you can see they're taking a break you got some shade here they're getting something great guy will be joined now by one of the members of the a caravan his name is Louis you're from Honduras tell me\nWhat are these people going and why are they doing\nAre we going to ...\n[noise] is the ones who goes at it for the border of United States and we come they coming over here because um [noise]\nA situation in our country is going back\nOh let me ask you this so as you know\nThe un ac ours here un high commissioner revenues refugees actually was brought them in to try to help processing the standard that they're going to use as unless you're a victim of reform have a credible fear of persecution from raise nationality religion or political views don't qualify for asylum so what are these people going to say when they get the United states\nFriday will face on then\nThey they gave them something they they are on the United states somebody if they can go to school so they get a permit and they can go to work as you know President Trump is that's\nIt that's it that's what\nYou needed to hear and I hope you understood what you just heard you cannot claim asylum in the United states\nUnless you are fleeing persecution on the base of race or religion or sexual orientation et cetera he ran down the reporter ran down the things that you can claim asylum or you're being persecuted in your country\nWhat is if you ask this ... this caravan remember that you're going to say when you get up there and he said basically we're coming to pick your jobs\nYou heard him\nWere coming to take advantage of your educational system are going to put our kids in your schools and we're going to take your jobs he said we want to go there and we want to work and then what are you going to do with that money by the way are you going to spend it in the United states lost at least helping to contribute to the United states economy\nHe's not going to let people in Mexico said they're not going to let these people pass I Will tell you aren't out earlier today we saw about two hundred wire police were going to stop them on this highway a brief they pulled back they retreated I don't think they want a confrontation but the point is held ... said he's not going to let people and you guys will\nSay that I found a lot less ... than we do we have over there\nAnd the people with a voter nail radio in the United states\nThere's a change though as you know that Mexico in the United states it's supposed to reach us third party saved agreement unless you follow fire sweeping request asylum in Mexico we're not going to the United states is not going to like you and that's going to be the reason for denial\nThey don't look back\nWay they send them back to our country we're coming back\nAnd that's what that's one\nOf the if they send us back we're going to turn around and come back again\nSo he says we're going to come here we want to take jobs and we're going to take money and we're going to send it back to support our family's back there this is why it's the vast majority of the members of this caravan are like I said working age males because they're gonna come to the United states to work they're not fleeing persecution for the race in Honduras\nThey're not fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation they're not fleeing persecution because of their ah of their uh ethnicity but not fleeing persecution because of a of any reason whatsoever they're coming to the United states because their nation\nCan't give them work\nAnd so they're coming to take jobs for people in another country and then they're going to repatriate those dollars back to their own country they don't want to come to the United states to be America\nHow do we know this\nBecause they're not walking under the American flag they're walking behind the massive street wits banner of the Hondurans live and then there are flying hunter and flags over themselves as they march\nIf a group of seven thousand people tries to enter another country flying their own flag that is not a migration that is an invasion\nThey don't want to abandon the nation that has essentially made their lives unlivable in their minds they want to move that nation north indoor better nation but not swear allegiance to that new nation\nOne would think that it might be more beneficial for these people to be flying an American flag over their heads saying we love America we want the American dream instead they're flying the Honduran flag saying we have a right to come here and still be Honduras we're bringing Honduras nor\nThrough Guatemala\nThrough Mexico into the United states and you can't stop us and if you try to we will turn around and come back again by the way the president of lettuce and last time he's going to have to let us in this time to\nNow the president of the United states last night speaking in Texas at his rally for Ted Cruz said really not so much I don't have to do that and I'm not going to do that\nAnd I'll let you hear a little bit more about that coming up after the break with the president says no we're not going to do that we're going to use whatever means necessary including as many troops necessary to secure that border and not allow this phony\nWith about a thousand now it's over seven thousand\nIt's organized this isn't just you know legitimate grass roots and just people are starting to walk and somebody else followed like Forrest Gump they're not just running alongside just random laying off the cuff this is an organized effort these people are funded and they're fed\nThey're given rides it's not all walking [noise] for taking turns robbing Trump's [noise] to what links do you want the president to go [noise]\nI Want to know

what we need to do and I said this not mocking Lee I said this legitimately because the president of the United states does have this power I mentioned this our number one of the broadcast this

already has congressional approval to stop this it wasn't given the Donald Trump the man\nThis was passed in Nineteen fifty two\nSection to twelve of the immigration and nationality nationality act

or there is a difference because just aliens could mean\nA immigrants trying to come to the United states legally or illegally but literally trying to immigrate to the United states that's different from those seeking refuge in the United states or seeking asylum in the United states there are different classes of people who want to come to the United states\nAnd that's why the language of this law passed by Congress in Nineteen fifty two is so important\nOne of the president finds that the injury of any aliens or any class of aliens in to the United states would be detrimental to the interest of the United states he may buy proclamation\nEnforce such period as he deems shall deem necessary\nSuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or not immigrants again meaning refugee seekers or asylum seekers or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions that he may deem appropriate this gives the president plenty ... power\nTo decide who gets to come

headline\nTrans people will be nonexistent in if Trump Trump gets his way in essentially what it what it means is that the Trump Administration as the New York times tries to ah you know a ... you

I Want to play something for you very quickly this was a part of a Fox News report um from Mexico or just on the northern side of a ... with a Guatemala and I'm\nA reporter is talking to one of them one of the migrants are one of the invaders depending on your point of view\nAnd saying you you can't claim asylum in the United states unless you are claiming persecution by your home countries government on the basis of one of of several things and those would be race religion nationality political opinion or social group\nSo if you can't credibly claim one of those things what is it that you're going to say when you get there and he was the response\nFriday or long face on then I don't know they're going to rally as\nThey they gave them something they can stay on the United states and they can and can't go to school so they can apartment\nAnd they can go to work as\nSo ... it's ... it's it's this plane is as the nose on your face they're saying essentially we don't have a claim to asylum we just want to go there and go to work we want to go there and take American Jobs away from American citizens or from illegal immigrants legal residents in the United states and then we're going to repatriate the money back to our own country\nThat we can't stand because we're leaving but were flying the flag 'cause we march northward anyway\nThat this is not about asylum there is no persecution and Honduras these people are just trying to circumvent immigration laws and come to the United states illegally\n[noise] if that caravan consisted of journalists lawyers and potential politicians or TV talk show host you can bet that wall would go up you know hurt the\nFact of the matter is that the vast majority of illegal immigrants are coming here for jobs or simply to take advantage of the system I mean that is a fact what ... what the journalists tried to spin a Bob Let's play identity politics for just a moment okay the progressive love\nMe let's act like Democrats yeah well you know kind of like that the question is what to do that okay\n[noise] um the fact of the matter is new and I've talked about this or the sewage commission has conducted hearings who studies on this issue [noise] those\nMigrants as they're called who are coming up here which is truly an invading force on ...\nThe vast majority of them are military age males Ninety percent of them I was looking very closely for the alleged families I didn't see an adult needs to be harsh about the schools are just affects the journalist seemed to gloss over [noise]\nBut as we've shown them civil rights commission\nOf these individuals are going to be displaced the low skilled American workers and what we found that the commission is that one group\nMost harshly affected by that displacement are black males blacks in general a black males and it's profound that forty percent of the decline in the labor force participation rate among blacks over the last couple of decades is attributable to competition\nLow wage competition from illegal immigrants who tend to congregate and compete with lax in many of the industries that blacks have been historically concentrated switches construction service agriculture so on and so forth when you do the math on it and we have\nWe're talking about nearly one million jobs where blacks have lost due to competition from low wage\nIllegal immigrants and I just do this but illegal immigrants [noise] now\nIf that were to happen in any other circumstance you can just imagine what the outcry would be American citizens were being harmed if we play the game of progressive on identity politics it is one of the most vulnerable cohorts in America in terms of\nTheir status in society but we don't hear anything about that from the politicians who are currently running for office the upcoming election and if you take a look at the Democratic party and their dependence on the black\nVote we know that Ninety percent\nOf the black vote traditionally goes to the Democratic candidate for president\nIn the same is true with respect to other officers but ... percent and if you only peel away a couple of percentage points\nOf is that a group from the Democratic party then they effectively become as competitive as weak part\nJust a couple of points that's all it takes it doesn't require ten percent or Fifteen Percent and that's why the whole county west German ground who have a [noise] a cause so much consternation on the left because it was a break\nIn the solid wall that the Democrats are progressive ...\nSo that's simply you know if they want to get your identity politics this is ... ... ... this is damaging to all of America but particularly those fever groups of the Democratic party and I would suggest that those favorite groups take a hard look at whether their interests are being protected by progressive\nPeter cursing our is our guest is the is a a commission on the United states commission on civil rights Pete um you mentioned the wall and your first remark I'm about how fast it would go up if it were those other individuals coming to this country\nAt the wall is is a very interesting point here because correct me if I'm wrong even if we were to build his wall it would not stop what we're seeing right now now it would would stop those we're branching off from the caravan when it gets to our border\nAnd rather than going to our point of entry and it's just crossing the river or jumping over a a lame little barbed wire fence you know that we used to consider a barrier for\nA to stop immigration but if they come that way yeah so what would stop that but all people would have to do is continue to go to the actual imported point of injury which would be gaps in the wall and say asylum I'm claiming asylum you gotta let me in and you got to lead then let me lose 'cause you're not allowed to pay me or my family or my children\nWe found that out with the last caravan of came through or else is going to be a political price to pay and a judge to tell you can't do that you gotta let me loose into the continental us and uh yeah I promise I'll come back for my for my asylum hearing which we know they don't do but won't wouldn't stop that would it be\n[noise] well it it would I think present a a a symbolic barrier\nOr it would make things a little bit more difficult I think that it would now you write that setting yourself at a\nQuarter century licking silently you seen that happened and again we started this civil rights issue within happens is no war the three to four percent of people\nWould turn for their hearing slips guns and disappear into the jury or the United states so President Trump is exactly right the laws need to be reformed they have to be more tells you put a wall\nWill have a I Believe to be a significant impact let's just take a look at current events [noise] we had a migration similar to what we're\nWitnessing right now in Europe from
