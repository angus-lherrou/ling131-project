helping us to recover the end of ... and I really do think that in the in the end argument is the answer\nUm it's it's not that that that's what the constitution really is it's a framework to argue it it doesn't it doesn't provide you with a clear set of answers it provides you with the ... which we argue\nAnd each generation needs to be able to\nDo that all the time terms\nAnd Madison's example is I think maybe the best because he's not gifted as Hamilton is with charisma or physical size you haven't got Washington's rectitude ... to ... or a legend but he just works at it he just works\nAt it every day he gets\nAny he thinks like a lawyer even though he's unlike Hamilton or at others or Jefferson he's not trained as a lawyer he just thinks that way and um\nAny you know he can change within his own mind that ability to sort of step on step across the chasm and occupy the other side and the and understand what balance names and\nSo I went to hell yea I'm if I'm pronouncing correctly about three months ago and spent some time around here but I tell ya and and I I went up to the second floor just looked at that window where he where he wrote those ... minutes of the constitution and I just thought to myself what a brain what an amazing\nYeah up here it's actually more impressive than I ever thought I mean I've been there to assist especially they've renovated it's about Fifteen miles from a lot of cello though a lot of people go to mount a cello don't go to the op ed at about a month to\nLand and the drugs are working\nFrom the relief factor dot com studios inside of the beltway answer welcome my first guest this morning Florida's governor Rick Scott is calling in from the sunshine state\nGovernor Scott welcome in the first question is how the recovery in the panhandle going\nWell that a lot of people working really hard with down to about twenty three thousand for some good morning or good had horses better\nDown to about twenty three thousand people\nWithout power right now homes and businesses half hour or so was ... on goal is to get most everybody back on ... there'll be some pockets of people off its left by um first of November the first part of next week so with our utility companies\nThat annoy National Guard our response I call the whole ... number the national guard these communities don't ever do home until ... or so and\nSo we've got a lot of work to do a yesterday I was with vice president Pence which was a good day because he came down to announce that the president's committed to rebuilding tend to air force base which is just to the east of Panama City\nUm that is a got a great military presence got a two and a half billion dollar impact\nOn our local economy there since ... about twenty thousand jobs so\nThat was a big deal we went to a a church that was a providing\nA a really nice lunch to our National Guard the coast guard members and families from ten to ...\nSo you know we're working hard every day and it's going to take a while um but for the ... we've had these were Kansas or I had one last year we come back you we build stronger people love to live in Florida we got the nicest people helping each other down here and got so many people coming from all over the country\nA serving food helping people parks on their house and then it's really nice\nYou know I've got a lot of support for ... over the last couple of weeks here because they they go down and do the heavy lifting I'm sure you run into him but back ten dull announcement is huge trucks out and I were talking when the hurricane hit\nHow homestead never came back after Andrew twenty five years ago and sort of get the confirmation from the president the vice president D O D the turtle is coming back that's a big deal to everyone in that community\nIt's a big deal and the truth is they need they need to come back a source of military mission you know we we don't have drilling in the eastern half of the ah the eastern part of the Gulf there that allows a our military to test I'm\nTest different um pieces of equipment aid they can do a lot of training there which is where you know where the air force in the navy that's where you're trained to learn to be a pilot and so they can do it on uninterrupted by um\nA commercial activity there so it's it's an important a mission for the for the United states we have twenty military bases and reunify command and as governor I've tried to do everything I can to help them to fill the mission\nAnd make sure all the military members enter veterans have all the resources they need to ... everybody want to live in the state\nNow governor Rick Scott let's turn to politics or I've heard it's sad that you would be running away with the Senate race but for the fact\nMichael wiped out the voting ability of many Floridians in the panhandle I read an executive order you sent out our ... going to be able to vote because they want to send you to Washington as their senator they really do want to replace Bill Nelson I Want to send you but they got to be able to vote and you know there aren't any school to go to\nA huge ... what we've done is we had eleven counties impacted and some some in fact a little bit less like a state capitals the ... county so we sat down with their supervisors election they were lifted the uh by county and we said how how can we work with you to make sure\nYou know people have the right to vote and they can get out there so you can vote by absentee or by mail um in our state um\nYou can do it by early voting and you can do it on election day and we've worked in every county to make sure of that you can get off the boat to what they did in Lake County which is Panama City they have five of supervise election wanted to do they have to stop by big mega sites 'cause that's what we've got\nA more damage where there's a lot of people and so the supervisors doing of elections down there is doing\nTSA I'm just making sure everybody gets off the boat and and clearly you know campaigns will do make sure people know where to vote because you know you what happens a lot of people they wake up on election they say okay I'm going to go vote and they just go to the last place they loaded on the last time\nAnd so there are everybody's working hard to let people know that you might have to be going to a different place\nAnd so how do you feel about the campaign right now I I look at the CPI average three of the last four polls have your head but you're busy doing hurricane recovery it's not really a campaign mode and the Rick Scott style which is a hundred and ten percent or how you juggling these facts\nBut my first job is to take their I'm an ... governance okay here's my citizen so that's what I've been doing my wife has gone a ending campaign for me I when I ... I wanted to run back into it and she says that score eight honey but I hate public speaking I'm scared to death well she was given four to five speeches a day and has done a great\nJob a so she's working there but here's why we're going with\nIt and actually become evident when you see her and so in hurricane here's the difference between the two of us I've been in the panhandle in ... county is generally three or four counties today\nMy opponent did three or four days a photo ops and he said oh there's nothing else I can do I'm going to go back to campaign either quicker and everybody knows that he doesn't want to work is not a worker\nI'm I Am and so people see that and they're losing we're going to win is they've watched for eight years\nBut I sat there and every day whatever whether whatever's going on I showed up and did my job\nSoon and all of a sudden he can't he actually won an additive saying one thing he's done nothing on education and that's not in the environment nothing on transportation there's up one day and it's become evidence and so he's the biggest example of why we have turned them he's been nothing in forty two years in ... in the public office\nForty two years wow you know and and the whole astronaut thing I actually thought he was an astronaut until someone informed me that he hitched a ride on the shuttle because he's on appropriations I really didn't think he was an after I ... I think it's one of those things that gets into the public psyche\nAnd they said you went through the whole program and all that stuff and I'm just amazed that in my living right I don't know that so Governor Scott what what's your agenda going to be in D.C what you want to bring to DC\nWell here's here's will give you and I'll give you why\nOkay I grew up in a family I don't know my dad I Lived in public housing going off\nAnd I watch my mom's struggle with food on the table get healthcare it all the struggles that people have so when I became governor my goal was to say that the three most important things to a family or one\nGuy had a job and plus to your children have to have the British patient because that's the chance to live the dream and number three you got to live in a sea change is it a little bit when you go to Washington but it's the same thing what do we do to to make the sec Hamid better for everybody\nWhat do we do to have an education system and most of the education issues are going to be done at the state level and how do we keep people safe at the federal level more but it's going to be tied tied to the military\nUm and so my my gender age is is to think about every family and how you make every family in America in a better position and so I think it's I think if they ... at the federal level it's gonna be the economy is going to be how do we make sure we defend the feelings of this country\nThat Governor I always tell people I Lived in California took two years ago I moved to Virginia to most diverse places in the country or Florida and California you've got lots of demographics or it's either to a greater ... parts of California the Central Valley doctor quite diverse\nBut how do you but you did very well with the Cuban community the Latino community Puerto Rican community the African American community the or the Asian American community do very well in every community why is that\nI show up with a simple as that\nUh I show up and I in my eyes I tell everybody and the sitting governor of the state I'm going to represent you I and so so in so I'm I'm going to focus on issues that are important to you I Know I Know for the Cuban their theory is your is\nOver with Rocco bomber incident building also did with regard to Raul Castro\nAnd his weight and they're furious that their country has basically been decimated by by uh the ... and the Nicaraguan fifth series of what happened um with are taking ... he's killing peaceful protesters and then with regard to Puerto Rican\nWhen they had Maria I showed up the next eight times we brought resources we brought 'em I sent them highway patrol vehicles National Guard um utility workers just show up and do your job and take care of everybody when you do people say look I cared about me for him\nWe could we could use that in some other campaigns Governor Scott it looks like you're surging it looks pretty good right now so last question what's your feeling about between the last ... you know we got ten days down now it's only ten days out\nA living when we just got to get you know right now it's we've got her message I just got to get people I don't know if everybody gets out of a then we're going to have a we're going to have a big win because people know there's a big difference so\nEarly voting underway already can people go vote today\nOn one point seven million people have already voted or by absentee early and so early start is by county so in the pan ... I think in the pan handle it starts on Saturday in other parts of states already started so that people voting that I think yes that was going to be something like sixty five percent will be before election day\nFor all my friends in Orlando and Tampa Sarasota in the panhandle all throughout Florida get out and vote early don't let it get their way to go today Rick Scott go talk to you governor and a kid was posted on on Kindle and everything else that's great news that the vice president brought down there yesterday\nA Chuck Todd and I were indeed thank you weren't they talking about whether or not it would it ever get back and that is great news I missed that yesterday and I'm Glad to hear that come up after the break turns into Joe secretaries are also is our next are Stanley McChrystal of course secretary of state Mike Pompeo we got lots of stuff happening on this Friday it's not a regular ... it's\nThat I can I also think that President George W.

had to visit the pharmacy this week for the Z pack and all the other stuff that goes when you get bronchitis a tell me and I was little sticker shock then I've got an insurance what were you in the president talking about yesterday about lowering drug prices\nWill you great to be with you again ah yesterday morning here at ha chess we actually revealed data showing that in one of the most important parts of our drug program\nMedicare pays one hundred and eighty percent of what Europeans and Japanese pay for the same medicines under deals that farm it gives them and the president came over here to ha jets and he said that's going to stop that for the free ride into the stop\nWe're ... we're going to be done without paying sticker price in that part of the Medicare program\nAnd we're going to get the benefit of these foreign prices here in America and all said Seventeen billion dollars over five years for the program and three and a half billion over five years for patients like you when you get your drugs\nNow ... I Want people to know your very find a lawyer you are what we call a litigator having clerked for the right honorable Michael ... my correct about that\nIndeed I was his first Locklear okay so I Want him to be our next attorney general but it was a litigator you all have concern for what the statute permits you to do and whether the regulations which will go up through the nose for comment ... are going to be labeled an overreach and you know the big pharma spends a hundred and Seventy one million bucks you're alarming so you're going to get\nA zillion comments during the notice income and face when do you\nThink uh and without pre judging the outcome ha chance we'll be able to issue a regulation from the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation to implement this proposal\nOur plan is to have this up and running by the end of twenty Nineteen so the end of next year or the beginning of twenty twenty\nWe're going to take input but let me be I Want to be really clear view\nWe're going to be doing this we're gonna get input to do it the right way but we're going to end of this foreign free riding that's not debatable it's gonna it's gonna happen but we'll do it the right way and we're doing it open and transparent process to ensure we're seeing around corners and doing everything right because we want to make sure this works for hospitals want to make sure it works for\nFor our providers for our doctors and want to make sure absolutely works for patients and will do whatever it takes\nTo make it work for all of them so they save money they have access and we stopped us for free riding in and help farmers taking advantage of us\nNow senator or is there I agree with all that but I go back to the fact I think by the time your regulars out and into the courts Chevron doctrine will have been greatly limited so I expect the Supreme Court to look very very closely at the statute under which you are proceeding\nHave you already done that as a litigator and can and persuaded yourself but you got the authority to do what essentially it looks like a referencing to me and mid point average and like the real clear politics average of drug prices and implement that as the will buy price preventive care\nThat that that's correct you know um I actually have through a what's called the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation\nExtremely broad authority to test alternative methods of making payments in Medicare to improve patient quality access and affordability and efficiency of the program\nThat's why this is a demonstration project that will take place in fifty percent of America it has very clear metrics to be studied ruin\nI have not the least bit of concern about our legal authority to do this to do this project\nThat's very good to know which ... now what about the Americans are on the other fifty percent of the country they're not going to be happy [laughter]\nWell you know I'm using as you just said I'm using the full authority that I've got I Do have to test a proposition I Can't just do it\nAcross the board for everyone now if Congress like this idea they can do it tomorrow across America I'm and I'm happy to work with them if they're interested in that up but for the rest of Americans who are not in the fifty areas the fifty percent of the country that will be doing this they're still going to see a benefit because as we the way the system works\nAs we hold down the reimbursements in this fifty percent of America\nThe silly way that we currently fixed prices in this program will also pulled down the reimbursements as a result in the other fifty percent of the country not as much but they will still get some of that benefit\nTo conclude secretaries or of health and Human Services you've got a new ...\nWell as what's going to notice and comment rule making you expect to have it in operation by twenty Nineteen what do you expect a health care premiums to look like in the year at\nA so we actually have had great results Medicare Advantage and part D these are two of the most important programs for our seniors\nThe premiums for them under President Trump's leadership have gone down and you know I I we we get some golf for this but we don't we don't like Obamacare we think it's fundamentally flawed we think it's broken we think the premiums are too high and it needs to be repealed and replaced\nBut President Trump's doing a better job running that program the guy the guy whose name is on it premiums actually for the silver benchmark plan on which everything is based\nAre going down over one percent in the coming year for the first time in the history of that program and choices of plans are up for the first time since two thousand Fifteen it's still a broken program it's still not meeting the needs of our citizens but we're at least making it work as well as it can until Congress and replaces it\nEighty five percent of my voice after suffering\nAlways because of his standard\nGraduate General Stanley

back always a pleasure to talk to you it's my honor thank you\nI I got to tell you this is a it's hard for me because I've spent hundreds of hours with dark I help Richard Nixon write the book leaders and Winston Churchill's great contemporaries is one of my favorites so when I saw that Stanley McChrystal had done ... talk for the new millennium\nSix pairs of leaders compare plus one stand on I thought I cannot wait to see the Thirteen are but I didn't allow myself to go to the table of contents I wanted to be surprised are you still and I bought my surprise are you still surprised by the leaders you and ... and mango and chose to profile\nWhew I actually am you know I thought we were going to come out with sort of a more expected political leader or even business leader group we tried to get diversity and what they did and their sex is in the background and whatnot and and I feel really good about it\nWell you said we lack I'm quoting you're now we lack the leadership equivalent of a general theory of relativity so you set out to outline and underscored the complexities and I teach the book and I thought to myself I don't have a formula and I don't think he wanted me to have a formula\nExactly right you know we we were writing this book and partway through we came out with the realization that leadership is it what we think it is and studying history we realize it never has been and show as we went back to deconstruct what leadership actually costs\nThat is we learned it's not something that leaders possess that they aim at followers and they make things happen it's really like an interaction between contextual factors followers and leaders and it's always changing and therefore endlessly complex\nSo now I Want a war in the eye and talking about some specifics from leaders myths and realities so if you want to be surprises I was you can just turn it off and go over to the book on Amazon dot com leaders Mitt than reality by Stanley McChrystal Jeff ... and Jason ... what if you don't mind getting a little bit of a a spoiler\nLet let me just say the biggest surprise for me is to find rubs fear and Zarqawi at the middle of your book but boy does it make sense when you're done with reading about these two villains say we're villainous leaders of extraordinary ability\nAnd the effectiveness that's exactly right and we we called it was jealous\nBecause their strength came from ... T of their conviction and the fact that they wouldn't waiver from what they believed even though we might think what they believe was completely wrong it gave them a magnetism for followers\nI also picked up general ... names I mean a great deal um zealots in other leaders end up with different sets of name for up spare became being corrupt double ... we took on many different ... that name for him and so this renaming process is part of our myth building\nAnd to get back to the core person you always went back to their childhood as grant recommended we do if you want to know the man find the child\nThat's exactly right because\nI don't think people stray too far from what initially forms and we talk about ... ... is this tough upbringing in Zarqa in Jordan industrial town he gets cat too she's kind of a bully he gets his fight she he does these things and so the rest of his life\nIs both a journey to move away from that to become a leader to become an\nIdeologically pure Islam is but also\nHe can't step away from the fact in many ways she's a thug\nAnd when he personally beheaded people he's not far from me she's\nThat's it and and it to bring up a full portrait of the evil and the ... tree and and do it in thirty pages is amazing there's lots of disgust Coco Chanel is a wonder\nAh Walt Disney is far more complex than I imagine and I got a confessed to I've never even heard I Hope I pronounced it correctly John who I've never even heard of him I'll be talking about him and not president she is using it with the secretary of state and a few minutes how when did you discover ... am I saying currently telling you\nHey John\nI hadn't died this year when we were studying this we wanted to find somebody from Asia China preferably and\nThat is that they ... it was a lot of what he's he's known for being seven feet tall and having a five foot waste\nBeing a made a unit get aged ten and then yet but coming very famous admiral all of those things don't seem believable and of course many of them may not be accurate\nBut the reality is she has become a symbol for modern China\nAnd so he symbolizes that China's past was international and show that the bell road initiative that Xi Jinping is pushing he can go back and point to somebody love Joan ... and go look this isn't new for us\nThis is legitimate because we've been doing it for hundreds of years\nThe astonishing success of the treasury play again I'm admitting my historical ignorance I didn't know about the treasure point I did not know that China had ventured as far as they did on the seas and then when you bring up the president is using it in the road and belt rhetoric\nAnd they're building this blue water navy there got more ... than we have right now General McChrystal it's a great warning to people to read leaders\nWell names better so called me stand whew [laughter]\nBut but no that's exactly right you know leaders get leverage to and when I say leaders get leveraged in their lifetime they can get leverage but their legacy gets leverage it has a purpose in value mean Coco Chanel is still a brand that sells things Joe ... is a symbol\n... Pierre in some ways is a symbol for some but it's also a cautionary tale for others\nHow somebody who's a lawyer by training who becomes fanatical in his beliefs so fanatical that he essentially leads to reign of terror we look at that and we say even somebody trying to achieve something as arguably\nAdmirable as a virtue in a new French Republic\nCan get so horribly off track\nNow I wanted to say the last three minutes of our very brief introduction to leaders and it's an every book stores on Amazon right now and I'm gonna try and get a General McChrystal over to the studio to do a long conversation about this\nUh the marble man Robert healing coming up is my bond payment other West Point man you're a ... point man but the sort of archetype of West point man is Robert Daly I didn't know that I'm reading from page twenty five\nOther general like either in our MacArthur Patton were depicted in statues at West point how 'bout for studying but for the league was reserved the special honor of emulate ... Iowa with many other young leaders ... to him for his unwavering dignity stoic commitment and courageous leadership but I've got a compliments you Stanley McChrystal because\nYou came to grips with the other side of the way and he was cruel to the people in slate and he broke his votes of the United states and so while he had to what you call the extraordinary ability for war deeply mixed record\nThat's exactly right I mean I grew up literally wishing I could be robber daily but never thinking that I could achieve that level of performance or actual as\nBut yet he really at two things first\nHe lost now people can make excuses you didn't have as many soldiers or logistics but he lost so if it was a CEO you judge that way but much more importantly he chose to betray the shame of that I made and that\nThe U.S secretary Palmdale made in the plane at West point tried to destroy the United states of America which his role model George Washington and helped create and then did it in defense of slavery\nAnd they almost no way to square that\nAnd I won't tell people about the portrait and your personal story 'cause that's worth that that gripped you and people need to read about it but I Want to know something you know the merits how many American family McChrystal rack up at West point\nOh that's an unfair question [laughter] zero I think I can see everyone [laughter]\nLet's let me let me close by talking with you about I'm not I've seen in Bernstein that's fascinating Harriet Tubman now I Know about Harriet Tubman from being a small child but boy did she have guts I\nDon't know that many people in America I Know that today\nI think when we think of Harriet Tubman we think of this small African American former slave she went back into slate controlled territory serve gene times if she'd been captured on one of them he would have she would have been re enslaved are probably executed\nTo bring out fellow slaves and so for personal courage\nHer personal dedication and yet she wanted nothing for herself\nAnd so as a consequence she lived to old age still very modest in our lifestyle very modest ... in for symbolism she became\nBoth for African Americans and for females proof that you can do things that matter and that ... she became incredibly important and I would argue still is\nToday and then finally the unusual pairing you're following the ... method here boss treated Margaret Thatcher is the most unusual come too but it works I mean are you surprised that it works\nYeah we we really short of wrestle with that one because they're very different but\nBut if you think about it Margaret Thatcher has this conviction of a set of beliefs and she's very effective\nTruly sort of a normal arc of a career and then of course she's
