FBI that could have reviewed this matter confidence shout confidentially then they leave it to the media I re reading the circus environment you're saying for the last two years\nNow he went on ... number twenty four\nOn first off let's understand why we had to have this hearing miss for these allegations that are confidential letter time Feinstein in July shortly after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for very not he was nominated Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader\nSaid that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happened for three months the Democrats have turned advise and consent process into a search and destroy mission\nThese allegations are completely unsupported my any evidence what evidence there is twenty thirty six year old climb all support judge Kavanaugh's denial but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate\nAnd the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they've run against judge Kavanaugh their argument of course was that doctor for an ass to have this housing confidentiality and if they tried to do that\nAnd that's what it was what limits limits on it I don't know now now now now John let me talk to you about that when I talk to your listeners about your views about that\nThere is a well established process of confidentiality on the committee\nDianne Feinstein could have show that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI who could have discreetly conducted\nThis inquiry in July and August without betraying misfortune competent says and they have betrayed her they pointed her lawyers Who Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge\nThose lawyers gonna have to face a D.C more investigation and in the midst their misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face an investigation for why they leak that\nIt could have been done discreetly happens hundreds upon hundreds of times every year and there's this year it's made it doesn't happen\nAnd then more Tom Cotton ... twenty five\nTo John any impact this entire episode has had on women's willingness to come forward and report sexual assault trying carts and also do immediately after it happens is caused by the Democrats is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respected her request for confidentiality mail when you come forward with an accusation as serious as the U.S\nIt has to be tested against the evidence and against ...\nAnd we would have known that confidentially inside of a new sheriff maybe aren't wasting its time\nAnd I don't know I don't know what the FBI is going to find that the committee has not already found that the committee staff has already interviewed all the witnesses that missed one sided they interviewed miss Ford and judge Kavanaugh for six\nHours after ... and she sent them a letter that was an interview you're not right about that so they've either interview them or they receive letters under penalty of perjury I sat for nowadays are actual interview so I'd be surprised if any of these\nPeople under penalty of perjury change their statements that they've already given this year well\nRead yeah one or cut from cotton because in the that is the bottom line you do not lie in a letter that subjects you to perjure you do not change your story when they arrived to talk to you in person twenty six\nJohn we already know what everyone who's alleged to be at the party a sad face committed statements urban interviewed under penalty of perjury I Would be shocked if any of them change her statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI but if this makes a few senators more comfortable about going forward and voting on judge Kavanaugh is\nVery highly qualified nomination\nAnd in the face of an orchestrated democratic smear campaign then was that may end up as a good I was just cannot truthful and everything he said in his testimony I found him to be truthful throughout his testimony I found them to be turns out he he was and I found him

was in there it's for our country I was in there for the behavior of Washington and um and in particular the Democrat\nAnd and they're treated there there's no there's sort of know caring about what the truth that everything is about political gain and be damned no matter who's like that you take out\nAnd when I when Kavanaugh came forward um ... in his testimony on Thursday I thought that was so over the hill so powerful Phil Ross who fad and heartbreaking because you can imagine what his family has gone around\nAnd and you know I I had to repeat that I'm In there it's the way that watch ... and ... and I know the only one I talked to a lot of people who had shared that same sense and who have been a cry\nHewlett been on both sides of the aisle and and ... and ... it's it's an awful\nI Am talking to women only callers this one\nYeah one eight hundred and five two oh one two three four had a half dozen already and they are angry too and and the ... people are not political are just outraged that this father of two young daughters is somehow indicted by being angry at being accused of being assessed criminal\n... we have to be able to step back and think and put yourself in that position whether you're a man or woman and we'll let you know went forward in his testimony where in Denver he had that he had\nUm experience I'll almost don't leak out these accusations\nMaybe more I ... at this point like time frame that are right but it was over a week and just he's on the legal accusation ... absolutely no way to defend himself and he had the white he had killed and he you know he had a parent\nAnd if they can if you will that leads you kind of reaction are you going to have\nWell if you're normal it'd be unless you know it's going to be angry it's going to be ... ... it's going to be every single thing they used to come out at an ... an army what he did what normal and you can't kill our normal\nAnd I hope that you go out and do your Salinas Ito thing which is to talk

good guy I Know when I talked with him I Would love to have dinner with them so we were talking about doing that I Am deeply deeply disappointed in that he did not rise to the defense of judge Kavanaugh's anger\nBecause he's a dad like I Am and I understand a dad who has been accused of horrific\nSex crimes or with a ten year old and a fourteen year old and friends and neighbors not able to

there is a furious backlash growing against Democrats for their descent into McCarthyism over Brett Kavanaugh but the Saturday Night live mocking them\nFor the latest reporting I turned to Mike Allen of Axios\nAm Mike good morning I Am told my reporting is that Mitch McConnell may bring\nA file for cloture tonight which would mean the culture but would be Wednesday in the final broke on Thursday do you have any contrary or additional supplemental reporting on that\nAs you I can tell you that the White House and Capitol Hill are anxious to see this very quickly reporting the New York times this morning that the president in an epithet\nLay the call we\nWould call a had a scolded\nMitch McConnell and a leader said that they should just damn bombed this through earlier and you here's why the her\nA ... popped up a story saying that Brett Kavanaugh is too big to fail now this is the administration to you that it's Brett Kavanaugh ... or ... they do not have a plan B there's not someone that that it there's not someone they're preparing to send to the game if for some reason Brett Kavanaugh should go down\nAnd fascinating a quote from uh from what was your fault in this process who said that they're worried that any male nominee could have what they called the Kavanaugh problem\nAnd a source told Jonathan Swan you dominate any man and you're worried about an act that's\nThirty six years old how do you vet or that\nThat is in fact what I'm hearing\nInterestingly Mike I'm living my calls today to women because they're worried about their husbands sons and grandsons fair worried that McCarthyism in this sort and McCarthyism is defined\nAs the taking of a terrible charge that is true in some contacts as against the Rosenbergs and his\nAnd applying it the innocent people as it was against the Hollywood blacklist and ruining their lives as a consequence here we have genuine me to her as a Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and a number of people in our business who have been outed as sexual predators\nBeing applied to Brett Kavanaugh with evidence one bit of testimony from Dr Ford which the women who are calling this morning are not buying and they are furious I think Heidi Heitkamp is going below the water as we speak and Joe mansion in diving in\nAnd I'm sad to say that I was so disappointed in Chris Coons where I think is one of the nicest people in Washington not standing up for the righteous outrage a judge Kavanaugh what are you hearing\nTo do it there's no question is emotional when I can tell you that there's a lot of women who are angry and even you feel violated and ah I can tell you that uh this is in addition to the\nPoint of view the you express but there's another one which is that\nThis could be a problem for Republicans if it looks rushed Republicans should have called for an FBI investigation earlier they should not let it be perceived\nAs being streamed constrictors constricted\nAnd limited as it is being perceived they should have a real FBI investigation and then everybody would feel more confident in the result will be better for Brett Kavanaugh it'd be better Supreme Court for short for sure for sure would be good for any Republican who's on the ballot\nYeah Mike I I have to say that I think that's how it's being perceived inside the beltway\nBut in my ten phone calls this morning I have done more reporting of women outside of the beltway than every other talking had I have seen who have been repeating left and right both pro Kevin on culture cabin on I'm actually talking to women and they they can't get through their seminar callers we know how to do under this Nineteen years\nWe know how to find first time caller who are outraged and the reporting is contract\nWith the blue bubbles on the news rooms believe and I don't know how we break out of this one of the things they're mad about is one point of view has been wildly over represented in the media this week and I don't watch pocket because I I don't like confirmation bias I watch MSNBC and CNN\nAnd do wild over representation of anti cabinet sentiment is in fact fueling the outrage by people who think he's getting slammed\n\nThe only good news for him is that a use than a played by Matt Damon now has a permanent ...\nWell yeah but that also feed into it I\nSaw that and I thought Matt Damon who are ... you don't have to agree with me on this who has contributed very little to the public good as far as I Know comes on and mock so good man it would be like mocking in the army McCarthy\nHearings chill Welsh Matt Damon should go and play Joe Welsh and the army McCarthy hearing and say have you know decency and the mad sputtering venom filled spittle flex rage because that's the parallel and\nIt is McCarthyism Mike and I think everyone who stands by and what's a good man gets married who has a ten year old and a fourteen year old daughter and a wife and parents they are complicit in this that's why I you can tell I'm furious I didn't even know Brett Kavanaugh never spoken to him in my life\nBut I'm a dad and I just cannot imagine this\nYou another piece of reporting we've popped up on ... years\nAnd this is related to the ... or ... idea a swan is picked up that we could well have a four four or\nFor a while if for some reason the Kavanaugh's nomination does not work out and do you add to that that a Democratic Senate certainly is a more likely than it was about to go\nThere is no sentiment inside the White House for nominating somebody that Democrats would confirm Swann has started shooting a
