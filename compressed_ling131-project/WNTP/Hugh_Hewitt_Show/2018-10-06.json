blame him for being angry and this is ridiculous\nEdition of the judge will somehow be a partisan or heard not display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nUh there were a couple of times where I think well the one time in particular where he asked judge or sugar corporate short question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut they shouldn't be expected just to take a\nThis was slander these allegations are criminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damage she goes family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and be justified in a showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be obliged some good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for\nJudge Kaplan I I I think it will be a huge mistake unless they're direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her career done as a Republican I never seem to be this way is that the general sense in the caucus\nWhile I think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for ah for the judge\nIn the middle of this political debacle another letter blurred it was from the president of the American bar association Robert Pearl so here's my Salem College Larry Elder that letter that the president\nOf the ab a sense urging the Senate Judiciary committee to

other quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump had his press conference and one of the points you made\nIs he said look I Want to use these terrorists has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with the tactic but what is it working 'cause these countries are reducing their care or\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of top economists found Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on\nRich Americans have been better off close but with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually help cats now that back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally passed at one Bill Clinton was president we got the Republican Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved the best of all worlds you know I my opinion we have a new free trade agreements now called the new apps M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer but it is a new on North American trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries\nIs modernized because America has a better deal and so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage on other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about this do you also very it got me on that one that is not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that well that's one of the things I think is bad economics and this plan so I'm going to agree with you on\nThat one so on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for a candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just idling just one quick thing are not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know we talked about this on your show the pro war and more what Americans producers called intellectual property we there's\nComputer software we hundreds Patton sent

I mean every important area flex let me give you a list right a list of\nAnd if I miss them eight I Would ask the two gentlemen with who I work to come up with something I missed or right now and by the way this is not an order of important it's sold in order of their appearance in my brain actually in my in my mind so for example\nHealth children parents spouse an over the marriage work right how many people\nCan say that in all of those areas of life\nThey have been the recipient of great happiness the answer is very few\nI was with somebody who has a spectacular life spectacular children in great health\nAnd a fair marriage affair marriage not a bad marriage at all not a particularly good beret\nAnd this person that can even say male or female this person or did I say great career as well do I mentioned that I don't think so children career health\nTerrific marriage fair\nAnd the answer it with the person like a better marriage absolutely is the person basically happy you absolutely\n\nBecause you have to find happiness where you can that's the lesson of today's happy this hour on and very few people find it in all major arenas\n\nAll right that's that's you ... you don't like your job okay you have a good marriage All right so be happy\n\nWith the the ability you do have happiness supplied as it were by every major avenue\nIs a rare warm for most people want any Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six is the number if you take this seriously you can have a happier life\nIt just it just doesn't work out for everybody to have every major area a happiness producer\nSo your task if you want to be happy as opposed to unhappy and I I this is one of the revelations of my life is how many people really don't work and being happy\nAnd I to me that's more amazing the people not working on their health but maybe it's maybe it's analogous\n\nYou know if if people do X Y or Z they would be healthier and they don't do it because I guess it's hard but maybe it's hard to be to work on being happy so\nIt is what it is but if you want to be happy or happy or you have to understand you have to accept the fact that very few people for very few people this life deliver in all arenas\nOf life that's that's key\nBecause otherwise what you do is you fixate on that which isn't good so this person was a a fair marriage that you know nothing to write home about and ... not worthy of divorce\nUnderstands that there are other avenues oh excuse me I Can't believe it I Can't believe it I missed one\nI should send myself the punishment room but I've never I've never done that I've the punishment room\nIs only earned for\nCarelessness not for content but I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe content you should apply anyway friends\nHow am I forget that one\nSo friends health marriage I said parents I uh I Know of course children I Know but I I'm thinking I it's the one includes parents in the look if you have wonderful parents it's a big bonus in life is all put parents and\nSo parents children friend's health work marriage there you go if you got 'em on all cylinders that I mean that's like having an all wheel drive\nAnd be and I was thinking of a brand name but I don't want to push any particular brand name here but you know what I mean I mean in all wheel drive super luxury s._u._v.\n\nAlright that's it's not most people can't afford it or just don't have it won a Prager seven seven six\nI get a cold and obviously you have a question or um you see few differ you know if you don't have one of those well the truth is if you don't have health that's a toughie\nI Would say of all of them that may be might might be the toughest but it depends what health means\nIf you if the health is debilitating or not for example Charles crowd hammer the wonderful late commentator you know it was paralyzed almost fully from the neck down that's bad health\nBut he he he was a fully functioning highly functioning more functioning that most people who are in power one\nIndividual who loved life [noise]\nAnd every body you gotta find happiness where you can and few people have it in all the arenas of life that I mentioned you are listening to the happiness our second hour every Friday on the dentist\nPrager show the Dennis Prager show live from the relief factor pain free studio\nAccomplished so that makes sense\nAbsolutely it's a very good answer I think yeah [laughter] oh You're welcome thank you that's the best question answer good\n[noise] ah I liked that\nWater if you do this is from tripled ...\nWant to do with the other person in your life fails to realize this can you be happy with someone who doesn't realize this he told me about a a a a love interest you're talking about a friend\nFor ... well I Would answer it let's say even a spouse let's say you have a spouse that isn't on board and in these matters twice said then you still have the pope fully\nHealth friend's children parents\nOr work and remember or not in order to be sources of happiness [noise] this is so I wasn't I was kidding about nine point nine four seven six for three to four seven three six to but I'm not kidding about how important this is\nAnd you can't that's why Julie's question was so important you can't pay this is how people live I'm not happy but I Will be happy when I get a raise\nWhen I have a better job when I Move to a to Baltimore oh well as a bad choice I'm kidding Baltimore I'm kidding I'm totally kidding don't be offended okay\nWhen I get married when I have children when my children got to get married when I look around right that's good when I lose this weight that's right yes there's always a wedding I'll be happy when you can't do I'll be happy when\n[laughter]\nThat that's the point that all this time until when that happens is wasted\n\nOn ... and you don't know how much time you'll get anyway you know people die young just for the record you don't you don't we don't have any guarantees you celebrate what you can\nNow yes it's very important the when issue ... people have that\nOf that I have talked about but not as the when the issue I liked that as the when issue I really could do another happiness book\n[noise]\nI I sit here and I do believe this is helping people that that gives me a joint [noise]\nYes\nExactly [noise] back in
