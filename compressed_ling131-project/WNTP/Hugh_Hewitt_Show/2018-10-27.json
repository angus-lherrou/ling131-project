to Ken Ken you're on was mark [noise]\nUm yes I voted for President Trump simply because he said he was going to drain the swamp it didn't mean if you were a Democrat or Republican you were bad he was trying to your your out\nAnd make America great again and it didn't matter what side you're on but if you were bad and all these people that are against them or running like little dogs which are terrible three are like\nThat and I think the Democrats overplay their hand let's go to Joe in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania you're on was mark\nHey mark I just don't understand I Can't get this through my head why Hillary Clinton isn't being held accountable when she opened recalled for civil unrest last week um until the Democrats are back in power when you do that and you have a national or international audience\nDon't wackos or want to come out of the woodwork and she should be held accountable for making that statement\nYeah but Joe she's on the other side she can say anything she wants [laughter]\nRight [laughter] [laughter] I you know what ... me the other day as far as ... concerned how the how to eliminate all media coverage say hey we're going to let them in but they have to register Republican in\nThe delivery you not hear anything about the cabin anymore yeah you're a great\nIn fact a ... you know I I agree with you if there was any thought that illegal immigrants were voting for Republicans in huge numbers certainly even even a majority\nWhy do I have a strong feeling that the Democrats would be against illegal immigration like they were four years right there are a lot of clips from buying into um Clinton or to Hillary Clinton all of them are against illegal immigration but now that it's convenient and they need the vote by the way\nIf they lose a minority votes in the proportions that Trump seems capable of doing the words they Democrats are always get what Nineteen Ninety five percent of voting Obama's case if it ever starts to go the other way they are in huge trouble\nBecause that's what they count on\nThat count as I mentioned the story with ... that they cannot just wrote here's what we do we vote for the Democrats they care about the poor the fact that they have and help the poor the fact that if you looked at the school system I teach part time and see what it's like in the inner cities none of that seems to matter their immune to that\nBecause what they have on their side they have to press they have the media they have the schools certainly have the colleges they have so many things going for them that it's no wonder that the Democrats get so many votes from minorities because they don't know\nThey don't know that a lot of the stuff they've been hearing and listening to all these years has done them no good\nThey told over and over again Republicans are evil they teach you there for big business yeah we didn't even get the big business vote last time most of the rich people in this country voted for Obama and certainly it wasn't a Trump vote for Hillary Clinton\nSo this idea that Republicans for for all of our big business and the Democrats or the poor and the people who and we had a court challenge me on that or for the poor and and the disenfranchised eats not true\nAnd that's what President Trump appeals to so many people because one of the things that gets them in trouble like everything in life there's a balance theory also helps and they know he says what he's thinking there is none of this spin and all the stuff the politicians usually do would you say one thing and then lose another way\nTo do with a different way\nThis guy is different he surprised me\nHe says some things on Twitter and do you know to eat some things you wish you wouldn't\nBut the American people are thrilled that they finally got a president that standing up for the United states of America finally got a president that understands that free enterprise is the thing that builds everybody that this is what makes America

we stayed in ... shape from Gulf packages of South Carolina who helped put together the trip the flavor of the town\nSo that our country is a good mix of cultures here you have failed midwinter colony than the north Easterners who come down here and spend the winter and a big equestrian component here and then you also have their history\nAnd the railroad history and you also have the savannah river site in Nashville lab out there bring some of the most intellectual and a lot of people\nIn the world fair none of them were on our golf trips by the way they've found maybe next time [laughter]\nAh but I like [noise] among many other things the small town atmosphere of a can of many of\nUs from the northeast\nIf you go way back were involved in small towns those small towns run away as factories closed as the suburban sprawl moved out of that shopping malls replaced mom and pop businesses\nThe small towns went down then may have come back\nIn terms of an economic redevelopment but not in a small town atmosphere as bedroom community communities of the big cities [noise] as a places where millennials\nNow live while they work uh after they've escaped their parents' basements and uh they tried to uh\nFind cheaper housing because they can't afford the expense of suburban housing so these small towns are still exist but not in a small town format a can is still the place where people are born grow up go to school go to high school football game on friday night church social on Saturday Night\nGo worship together on Sunday raise their families and live in a slower nicer environment [noise]\nYes I think one of the other things that we have going for us to is University in South Carolina it can cause a vibrant small college and it's been voted again it's one of the top ten by US News so I think that keeps free generating the area you have\nThe winter colony a lot of retirees here but then you also have the younger folks that are coming to you at the age can\nFrom within South Carolina and nearby a small college that appeal to them which keeps that the culture going\nAnd speaking of voting there's signs all over town because you're very proud

unique it is a combination of older houses and stayed homes that had been put together in this thirty seven room or sweet in\nWrite in the middle of the walking section of vacant and it's so comfortable to be here even here some of our golfers having a good time they're sitting on the side porch\nSmoking cigars by the fireplace talk and tell lies and I guess that's a big part of it but ... and ... when you started this [noise]\nParticular business right here did you ever think you'd be getting some golfers coming in a\nUm [noise] no I don't I really didn't think about who was who would be staying originally but I'm from the beginning we had a\nMom Augusta National has helped his client and continue to do that we have a big way from Australia that comes in ... so I'm happy golfers are great I Can't\nBut they certainly they certainly are great guess there's little question about that\nUm take care of and sometimes I don't understand\nWhy [laughter]\nI hear you on that one a trust me I've been on enough of these trips I have to take care of all I'm I'm a big babysitters sometimes but I'm the best part about him though is basically good people they're fun loving

all happy for you to\nBe here yeah well it even the ones from Pennsylvania I've got 'em all saying you're all\nRight [laughter]\nYou know\nOne of the things that I Love about the carriage house in the

pants this morning I don't I Can't comment that by [laughter]\nOkay All right well we thank goodness talk loud doesn't have any pressure on that um [noise]\nAnd the the other part about it is that they're so close to the rest of the action in town in the bars and restaurants and that makes it fun for them they don't have\nTo get out and drive at night right for all life and we give him bird seed when when when they lean\nSo they can find a way that\nIt takes a little golf version of Hansel and Gretel courtesy of van Thomas in and everybody here at the carriage house in\nUm [noise] I think that uh what our listeners would be most interested in is that ah\nThere's a large equestrian industry close by here too so but anybody is listening in who wants to take part in some of the worst shows in steeplechase is a thing around here in the cards houses are perfect spot for that you're so close solve that action as well as all of the golf courses\nTo had to uh make good on that yet yet in Twenty years\nNow the second stop on our tour was the river club when you talk about being across the river from Augusta National ... it really is across the river is about a river goes right on the side of the force or\nAcross from downtown\nThug Gostin a\nAnd a little bit different topography from some of the other courses or you play this week uh is flat\nGym ponds yo design there is this is a great lay out\nA lot of water but as you would imagine ... next to the river but there's a friendly course a it's a well received grains that up but really well not a lot of manipulation home so uh it's it's a good chance of\nBut also if they are tested\nThe brains were absolutely perfect absolutely perfect [noise] and uh everybody comment on that [noise]\nIt it is different it it's

or\nThe topography there is a [noise] is is just hard woods are\nRolling hills and and I tell bugs is one of those courses that that you look at [noise] either looking at the whole from the tea or get on the green and look back at the tea box and you say gosh what a great golf oh yeah\nAnd and it's very reminiscent of Augusta National shot replica replica holes but the topography the style of the golf course the\nHills elevation changes and the undulating greens huge undulating greens [noise] um [noise] it really does there has come holes where you stand near Santa my ...\nIs just the whole feel the golf course like you're saying it's a it's the way the courses laid out\nThe static sort of course the brick bridges the wall to and from the grain [noise] uh it's just it's just a lovely

center square golf club and it will be the final round of golf played ever on the\nGolf course and it's being closed for development now because it didn't do well it did amazingly over the years one of the busiest courses in the entire area but fortunately it was just too valuable piece of property and those are made an offer that the owners could not refuse\nAnd we're going to lose a very popular golf course on October thirty first that center square golf club very first golf club I ever played a full size golf club so a fond farewell to center square golf club [noise]\nNext week well

decides to be happy like one decides to do anything else in life\nThat's right it's a decision for the for the great majority of people some sometimes it's not but overwhelmingly\nIt is a it'd be seasonal boiling seeds will be there all say gee a coup meant no sit and they you\n\nKnow we are definitely flipping out and when your engineer flips that we've you it is not a good sign only one of us should flip out at any one time I've done is\nPrager I've written a book on happiness lectured on happiness all over the world even to penguins in the Antarctic that is correct we should put that picture up\nActually I spoke to penguins in the Antarctic a Mitt to subject happiness and ethical monotheism\nAnd they ah they were equally interested in both there was one paying women will be a hundred or so looking at me the other is most of the others had their nose under the butt of their partner\nWas just strange pets\nWhy does that make me straight ... because the beat [noise]\nThey don't have ... okay they beaks banquet seven penguins have beaks and I guess you're a member there birds there at Quantico birds I guess why every body and this is the happiness our today's subject\nI admit at the outset so here is a trigger warning we need you know what we need a musical or some sound effect [noise]\n\nIt's not a dog whistle it's a trigger now there's not a dog whistle this is a trigger\nFor the sensitive\nSo that they will know that they may be challenged or even or God Forbid really God Forbid offended that knows that works\nSo here it is every body and\nThe what made me think of this topic was actually the last hour the previous hour talking about nationalism so I have a theory and you've probably heard me say that ... thousand or so times 'cause I have a lot of theories about life Barbara theory\nThat identities are important to happiness\n\nWith me and I'm thinking of three and there may be more and if you have more or if you defer certainly if you defer one aide Prager seven seven six but first hear what the identities are\nAnd they are in no uh in order important ... three identities that I think are\nThey are necessary or they are major additives to one's happiness but they are not sufficient if this is this a low doesn't make you happy they are great\nAdditives supplements contribute towards that is the word they are great contribute towards towards happiness or sexual identity male or female a national identity and the religious identity [noise]\nI think in my lifetime I have seen that these things are real contributors now the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those and I won't even identify them cause it to happiness our on every body to listen and everybody to be as comfortable as possible\nBut there are those who are working\nTo notify those identities and\nThat they they really are not real and if they are not even good [noise] but that's and therefore I truly truly believe\nWell look I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what what she says is true\nSusan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find tendered spirits otherwise you'd be very lonely and we'd be\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't that interesting I of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she said she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics\nBut interesting it's a very interesting defining element in the ideological rift in America thank you Susan I appreciate that uh ed in Chicago hello ed Dennis Prager\nNana thank you so much for taking my call long time listener I Am driving with my son who is Eighteen years old who is away at college and they're\nDriving in the car and expose them to your show and or your radio shows that you're a you're a university and with regard to identity his name is ... and you want to talk a little bit about his identity issues and he's in college in California\nYeah yeah pretty much I I I grew up in a\nBox of Chicago and then I I just moved to California I Am a pretty much when I'm In a classroom like I talk about that are led by on at like a lot of questions like that and\nIf I if I buy on that like I get back by what like\nWhat is the best way to react I hear a lot of like it at all\nRight All right I'm going to answer you I'm delighted that you're both such such a nice thing a father and son wants to make the show in the car I\nHave a very sweet ... of the two of you think you look this is again this transcends specifically the happiness\nIssue but my general approach is to clarify where we differ it comes across as extremely non aggressive totally non defensive\nBoth so you're not defending you and you're not in attacking them just say listen we're we're both here to study and we're both students and or you know we're a good guy and so on and so what I like to do just what I like to do is I like to figure out where it is I I might differ with somebody\nSo then you just you you could ask a if a few questions or a\nAnd one of them might be you know I celebrate\nI Wonder do you celebrate being male\nThis this identity issue would be fascinating\n\nNine nine images
