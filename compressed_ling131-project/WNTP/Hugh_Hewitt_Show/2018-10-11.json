Republicans have a woman problem this is not new that just seems that gotten worse how do they find out that ...\nYeah I mean I think this is the most potent potential\nProblem that Trump has brought to the mid term that tension problem I ... I ... that look I think he has taken a group of maybe swing flash slightly right leaning white college educated ex urban women and mom and\nShipped in them to more fully swing voters or even folks who will lean left or in the future and that is a problem particularly in these vulnerable how the I Will say also though that this cannot buy I think people are potentially underestimating how much it did energize Republicans on the other side including Republican women\nUm and the issue for Democrats I think that their enthusiasm was already here it was already way up here and art and the Republican Party is that is to bring parenting and so I think they actually do have a chance to gain a bat\nAnd it will matter more in the Senate races than it does and he's vulnerable house races where those women really mattered\nSwitching last share and and care pointed out energizing at Republicans and in your thing Republican to win and that you think that they really ... the Republican strategy ... strategy of a weapon I sing Brett Kavanaugh you know they just do this for the next four weeks do you think that that's a winning strategy\nI definitely think it's a winning strategy for the midterm there could be a long term consequences that we look back at this moment ... said that this was you know one moment on our way to Republicans having a demographic problem but in terms in the mid term I think Mary Catherine is exactly right Democrats are already motivated\nDonald Trump like nothing that happened uh you know last week is going to matter to the person who's already upset about all the other thing Donald Trump and Don Democrats were motivated passionate\nAngry Saturday are either going to turn out or they are not Republicans there the theme that needed the the excitement the past and the energy they didn't have it\nIn mid term that's what matters for turnout and now I think they do and it's because I Believe it's the overreaction of a lap when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word totally a mop it is without\nA doubt that I don't know whether we're now you\nKnow put a stop on a mob\nIs what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go by what we saw the thing I don't think we've right\nAbout the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls\nThat simple protest or without a mob I think he is only a mob\nYeah and if there weren't any party or as we call it a mob ... come up with the area now let me let me let me move past the\nN. word because I Do feel like that in part of the the weaponization of of what's happening now on the right but at the same time I think you do make a really interesting point and a piece I write in your day that while this whole issue with cabin on Ford has been incredibly does this in this country it has been unify\nAmong Republicans like Republicans had a Republican problem and you had the Trump or isn't the never Trump or in your whole point is that this is what\nCauses Republican to be one big one by the family again\n[noise] yeah look I think that that\nThe Brett Kavanaugh okay now there are never Trump or prominent never cropper who aren't and ... and intellectuals that this was very ... uh the Kavanaugh case really split the never Trump movement and you had about half of them the era era ends of the world who are basically they hated Donald Trump but now\nThey feel pushed into Donald Trump camp I think it's a backlash against the lab\nUm and then you add other people like the ... of the world the dinner for Ruben ... of the world that were pushed the other way but in terms of the rank and file average Republican voter\nA lot of people out there around the country they don't really like Donald Trump but they\nSaw Brett Kavanaugh as just a regular kind of conservative they have Bush or Marco Rubio would have Pecker George W.

that the Saudi kingdom could play a very large role in that new policy\nAnd that he meant what he said during the campaign about taking on Iran\nBolstering Israel working on a peace plan to try to

on your on the relief factor that comes through you know inside the beltway Michael living daylights out of Panama City we don't even have any photos yet or\nVideo of gender male air force base I'm joined by colonel ... ... a retired United States army author of militant normal\nNo most important for understanding what is going on in American politics today militant normal is shot up bestsellers everywhere and everybody loves Kurt but I Want to begin with your army hat on your retired now Kurt a tend to help that means a lot army family I airport families lost everything yesterday\nYeah it does a hue and look I did disaster relief for a long time with the California National Guard I was a hell no a earthquake in Ninety four the LA Riots I commanded forces in northern San Diego in the San Diego fire crisis in two thousand seven\nSo you know I I I've been in the middle of these but nothing nothing like this this is going to be incredible and\nThe the devastation or military families are military equipment uh and and of course the the people on the Florida coast it is it's going to be incredible and we're going to see a huge effort or a huge collection of a military and civilian\nEfforts going into what will leave all I think I think this is one of the things that Donald Trump has done very well Hugh\nWhich is a a focus on these disasters course got help Rick Scott too because it shows competence I mean would you would you want to trust them with us a kind of recovery ...\nIt's a real test of seriousness for the people for them right\nRight and and I think seriousness is on the ballot in fact after Eric Holder yesterday to talk to you about Eric I got a plan for people so that if they are just tuning in this was the former attorney general now presidential candidate Eric Holder caught on a cell phone video at a small gathering cut numbering\nThey have to use the power they have gotten poor but all the wrong things\nThey want to keep themselves in how they want to teeter to special interests me this time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are going to be as dedicated as they are to be in a minute as they are Michele always ask them all over you know\nMy wife went really tight hum when you're willing to give me an ra [laughter] it was always says that you know when they go low we go [noise] they go low we can\nEncourage slick their what their military normal ... think about that\nWell look militant normal are saying yeah I I Know you know I guess I guess when we go low you run guns to Mexico and get held in contempt of Congress you or a sick the IRS on us say it looks like they ... the uh\nUh FBI on our leaders uh the the folks we elected I I mean really you how did these guy how are these guys start playing hardball did they resurrect stop from nursery school I mean we're already at ... with that Stephen Miller article about eating aced as a kid I mean we're already at third grade I mean how deep do we go\nIt's triggered some CNN anchor as like Don Lemon you're not allowed to use the word mob around them or they they go into meltdown you Don limited mix it up before but I get to a more profound thing right now the media is trying to say how long will the cabinet backlash yesterday I saw Chuck Schumer come out with a bunch of Democrats they didn't mentioned Kevin I'll watch that tells me\nThat Martha Mick Sally surged a Marsha Blackburn surge Matt Rosendale surge the surge of my Bronx that it's very deep and wide\nWell look at it so bad for the Democrats the Dino Rossi is starting to win something in Washington\nYep how bad it is that\nFair that may give everything to make sure dino loses yeah that's that's like a certain number one thing check check dino out of a win but I think it goes to this military normal phenomenon that you've been talking about and and explain for people who live in a cave what a militant normal it's\nOK normal people are just you know she were or are the kind of people don't spend all their time on politics they're too busy building this country feeding it fueling it even defending it on their regular folks who who trusts the elite go run our country\nRunner institutions I Want security and prosperity as long as you do that you know you take a little off the top you have your power your prestige or money\nThat's fine I Want to live my life I Want to do things like teach my kids basketball team go to church even enjoy the occasional beer\nUp but when they screw up you know the normal come back and react the silent majority throwing out Jimmy Carter the problem now Hugh is not only are leads incompetent or refusing to accept any kind of accountability they actually hate normal people\nAnd you you can see the I mean you get Amory Clinton interview the other day saying well you know there can't be any civility I I mean we're in charge a good that's the civility of the great pass\nIt it it is and I I Do believe that when they asked the question how long will last their tempting do message Democrats not to talk about this I don't think you forget getting mugged a month later I really don't think\nYou put the mugging behind you are getting hit by a car or watching someone get murdered ... not over in a month and a and I don't think the militant normal are going to forget cabinet and Chuck Grassley a funny belly you might be said yesterday remember cabinet ... that is the militant normal rallying cry\nWill look is is the uh you know as the hip kids say the militant normal Scott woke by Kavanaugh we're kind of OK things are going good we're\nWe're just going to go back to our lives and then they realized what complete lunatics the people on the other side we're in and and frankly evil lunatics I mean you don't do what they did the cabinet any way that that is unacceptable every every normal man out there thought\nWait a minute this is a license to destroy anybody pops his head up and opposes\nThe elite this you know in every uh every woman had to think ... I got a husband and I got a brother I got a son he can be destroyed in an instant by these people if we let\nThem take shelter for ...\nIt was a cookbook and if it had worked there I you know I I joke to some of us that there will never be another white male Supreme Court justice but that is probably not true because it didn't work but all of a sudden if we've got Stephen Miller third grade picture\nPosted then we know the extent and depth to which they will go and I this is not political it isn't the way we do things church like there\nWill look like I'm ready to militant normal we've really got two choices we can accept this and say okay you're beaten us I'm I'm taking this whole infatuation with participating in my own self governance off the table you can do what you want or you can say no\nNo I'm not going to do I'm going to vote for the dino Ross is I have over ... ... in the hallways and the blondes and and the ...\nI'm not going to let these people\nWhen and and we're seeing the ... ... last week when we talk we talked about anecdotally we we both talk to you talked to a bunch of people on the radio I I talked to a bunch of people in real life and I was treated to such amazing insights conservatives calling me and say ... you know who I Love Lindsey Graham\nYeah [laughter]\nNow we're seeing it in the polls liquid black burns pulling away mix how he was up what six yesterday\nYeah sad yeah and you know why she looks at them and goes man you're a loser and he's winning and I think we're\nVeering into their given up on ... I've been all day he's gone and and they're giving up on a very very slowly but they're giving up on them I don't know how bad it will be for them because early voting it's it's hitting this could be better time I guess they wanted to wait another week of embarrassing themselves\nBut last question courage like your when you go to your book parties and you go out and you do your signings how often do people bring up cabinet to you\nAll the time a ... and people are angry\nThey're furious because this was a grave injustice unless you're some weird social justice warrior who thinks that a due process is some sort of an infringement\nOn on human rights as someone who turns a thousand years of Anglo American Jurisprudence on his head you realize the central injustice of being\nA a judged guilty before you have a chance to defend\nYourself and normal up with that\nThere's a Politico story GOP closes in on Heitkamp knockout and control of the Senate or by ... the north Dakota Democrat double digit last ah looks like it's coming that is just a pure repudiation of what she did the cabin on she was down but now she fallen bumped the poor\nWe're seeing that all all across the country here I I think that we're going to add in the Senate and I ... and it's looking at her in the house I think we keep the house will lose ten Fifteen but I think we're going to keep the house and I think that they're going to melt down it's going to be hilarious\nYeah ... thirty seconds what will that the you know I was in Bertie rock on twenty sixteen election night I don't know what will happen if it happens is the second time\nI'm hoping that we have compilations of videos of Democrats screaming at the sky and crying [laughter] because you know I Wish debate than their tears and they brought it on themselves you want no civility let's play ... let's show you wouldn't know civility looks like a I Want them to lose\nAnd I want them to learn from pain right\nAbout where you don't pick people when they're down we merely pointers of them and posted\nYeah we point out that they failed and that maybe you ought to appeal to a normal Americans instead of a weird campus breaks\n[noise] and I\nSaid is that I mean the party of crime that's what's happening [noise]\nRepublican\nParty of order and says we are also party of jobs jobs jobs you see that\nThat is by the way a killer a closing argument and the president's going to make it in rally after rally I watched the beginning of the Pennsylvania\nAround like of an area where I went to summer camp for people not nothing works here and he's not a tyrant one hell of a politician said for you to a child [noise]\n\nNews dog nine Ninety [noise] here in the middle\nA nonstop action pack information [noise] she she was just coming right back [noise]\nYou know what not smart job sites that overwhelming with tons of the wrong resumes but you know what is smart\nZipper critter dot com slash ... ... per quarter dot com slash H.

was an arms race we weren't even part of it that your choice where do you want to go first about either of these incredibly important stories\nAll we can do either one of just arbitrarily pick a shaggy\nAll right go ahead what do we what what are the stakes and what are we to be demanding and doing\nWell the stakes are huge and I think you know where I went to with this you was the context\nOkay and the context is that Trump has done a pretty good job to this point of rebuilding the paradigm the the set of partnerships that we've always used I mean since Camp David accords and the Iranian Revolution in Seventy nine that we do is to protect our interests and that is a partnership\nWith you know Egypt Jordan Israel several of the Gulf states and often on Saudi Arabia so\nAh yes we need to put pressure on the Saudis to make very clear that we don't like this but this is one of these instances where we got to remember\nYou know we're the friend that liberty everywhere but the custodian only of our own\nAnd we have to tend to America's interests and I tell my friends who and I share this you know who who want human rights to be an object of our policy I Believe in that but I'm the I'm the ... the prospering of human rights around the world that hands on the continued security\nAnd vitality of of the United states so yes we have to pressure them but I think we also have to understand that right now we're working with them and a lot of areas\nDo you think that the market collapse has some concern over this down down eight hundred and thirty one point yesterday it's often other two hundred and twenty and the free market there are some worry that there's a rupture a foot\nWell potentially although they are going to ask about the market you either get Kudlow or somebody like me I you know I don't know we'll see if this continues I'm actually I'm I mean I always do these things as kind of a correction until something you know something emerges show different\nAll right let's move over to the fact of the Bloomberg report that the Chinese had been weaponized seeing the commercials say a commercial product stuff that everybody buys they had been weaponized saying that would be an arms race in which we were not participants 'cause we don't do that\nYeah and they do this and first of all\nThere's almost no civil military divide in China\nAll the companies all the efforts are are directed towards the end of the state or they're producing a lot of the components that are used in information technology communications infrastructure around the world and there's been a concern for a long time about what they may be planting in those components and this is going to get\nThis is going to get bigger as five gee comes along and and and the number of those of those devices and the importance of them to every aspect of life you know multiplies geometric when it's a real challenge and I'm I'm ... glad the administration is focused so much in this national competition is long overdue\nWho has the lead on this\nIt's an interagency thing you and that's part of the problem is\nThat's not good yeah\nWell I understand but we're not organized I mean Trump is Trump's people had to do a lot of things at once and one of them has to consider how we organize as a government to deal with this you know it's like\nTrying like when we built the architecture of the Cold War national security policy took a decade right so we got to do it quicker than that I Would say that the commerce trade representative deal do you have a lot to say about it because the court they have a lot of these devices it's homeland\nUm it's a whole lot of different agencies and organizations involved\nNow a center of town in terms of of sanctions against China do we concerning ourselves with for example the fact that they are relocating a million wires into concentration camps is that our business\nWell it's a it's a good pressure point it's a yes it is our business because uh on one level of the United states speaks for human rights around the world\nUm and and we should do it by the way with regard to this out and I'm not suggesting that we are seeing them I mean what we need to call him out on and we just have to be censored but broader context here I think it's a\nTremendously good pressure Boyd against season not just the ... what they're doing in Hong Kong or what they're doing generally just social credit system they're developing the minute control the lives\nThere are people yeah they're sensitive to that and we should use it as a pressure point that's one area I've not seen a lot out of the Trump Administration yet although the vice president's speech the other day and kudos to you for that interview a was a really good opening wedge him now\n[laughter] I Hope it keeps it up Jim Talent always a pleasure by the way Claire McCaskill just wrote off the Boot Hill of of Missouri what kind of politics is that\nUh [noise] I don't think it's very good but I don't think the trend line the last couple of weeks her in very good for Senator McCaskill so that\nKind of like holding up a tent and going to St Louis and hoping for the best right\nNow we got to keep working on and we're nobody's fully up any pant leg room line\nGory America what was your eyes Canada to hear it from the relief factor dot com studios inside the beltway joined by meet the press house Chuck Todd\nChecked because you were a Floridian I Want to begin with Marco Rubio sounds distraught and everything I see from Panama City and I hear from ten they'll air force base says homestead after ... what's your ear and\nYeah yeah and you know you got to remember this part of the state you know it's interesting [noise] it just doesn't get hit\nWith with the mild hurricane the that this is\nFor some reason the way that things turn they either make a you know go slightly south of that area and ... you know across the state\nEssentially just north of the act or a interstate or they fear a little farther to the west it hit where I have family in Pensacola I mean this was so odd perhaps a pan handle hidden and to call it basically all I got to understand um it's so this part of Florida see it's it's a double whammy here it's the most\nYou know one of the most powerful storms in the history of the state in an area that had been hit very often so it just adds to the devastation because you haven't had the clearing out of trees with smaller storms in the same way you do in other parts of the state to just doubled impact and then this thing was just the only good news is that it moves fast\nEspecially on the good now I remember after a homestead the Indians were gonna move spring training camps that ... that was gone that air force base has gone I Wonder if ten Dale isn't done what I'm hearing is true luckily they got all the people out with her falcons of military families and then the left\nAnd here's here's the thing you and I both know we ... the ... the Pentagon think there are too many base within the country but there's no political will a closed them but if any of them I don't work they get quote what happened on his head yup look I remember that was going to be our new airport you know that was that was another idea to try to you know\nInstead of trying to ... you know try to expand Miami international airport which is some argue too close to downtown as it is\nRight for flight paths and things like that and and you know what it just didn't happen unfortunately home states to to to sort of not wasn't was which is too far south for the rest of the population and that's my fear of what's going to happen to Kendall ended up my fear of what's gonna happen look the beach communities will rebuild\nUm because you know those people are pirates and and I say\nThat as I Know that God son and I I you know that they're not ... or some of the and the elements of the call for some of the ... these are people that I Want to be in my next nine to five and a resilient\nTheir resilience they'll rebuild but it it is going to have a big devastating impact on the economy\nWill follow it let let's switch to a story I Do not know ... I read his stuff in the post for a long time I was suing the story with the vice president yesterday and will continue to do so a senior administration officials today\nIt comes in the context of a very delicate relationship last night run dumber and Yusef our typing actually had dinner together at a a event honoring Mike Pompeo said this context is an incredibly sensitive relationship but an outrageous extrajudicial apparently murder\nDo this is going to be look I think this is going to be a long term fight inside this country and say this government about what to do and I said this country really inside the government I think you made the\nI think that I as you know the Trump Administration has very close ties with the Gulf states and all the Gulf leaders led by NBS um all of it has been about trying to create a coalition essentially against Iran you know we know what the strategic reason is behind it it's all about Iran\nUm but you know how much how much can you look the other way on that\nI mean this is and I can tell you you can't and I don't\nThink the diplomatic humidity is going to allow you know this idea you know the president is already pushing back on the ideas of sanctions hey we've got too many other things going on with the country the relationship is too big\nI have to tell you I think when you see I think there's going to be this is going to be just like with Russia where there's going to be a bipartisan\nUm groundswell to punish Saudi Arabia here including from corporate America look I think at the end of the day the most effective tool\nAgainst the Saudis on this affect the punishment is going to be inflicted by corporate America more than it is by the United states of America or in the government because uh you know and the scares a lot about it about Saudi Arabia's reputation around there are and\nI I I I that you already saw\nA company that there's that gets a tech conference wary of the times pulled out a whole bunch of tech leaders say well I didn't know I was on that press release so I think they went to sing on that\nYeah five desert is over a ... why do you think it is likely that the Henry the second ... comes up you know he says well no one read me a bit meddlesome praised in Port crusader run over and killed back at do you think we'll get\nThe the offering up that uh some low and just read this the wrong way and that NBS didn't want to kill the wanted and brought back\nOh well I've already look or Richard Engel reported on my show two days ago that there's already shatter that this was a rendition gone bad it was supposed to die um and that that was an accident um\nThat'd be a better measure that make that that one thing to say\nUm but right now there's still just denying anything ever happened so look there is I find it fascinating at how comfortable ... how aggressive Turkey's being on this\nI I have to have to admit I was skeptical that they would be the ... district ... ah I I'm I'm Still waiting for him to get there to one on this one all that said\nWe should live in the real world on on this when it comes to Saudi Arabia NBS is trying to essentially eliminate all his enemy whether their family members are not bright he's trying to consolidate power people that try to consolidate power also become um become\nPotential targets on again BS\nI just think that that that the Saudi Arabia power struggle is something that it's going to be come be a foreign policy challenge for this country for some time I have a feeling that it may get uglier inside the kingdom for him but yet\nInteresting answer they are at let's switch to the cabinet of fact I think Eric Holder's videotape Secretary Clinton's comments\nHave armed with the Republicans to take what was\nA big
