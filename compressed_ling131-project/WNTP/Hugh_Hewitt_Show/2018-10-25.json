have Andrew Gillum God\nWhen officers in the way I really can't imagine Florida voters Andrew Gillum override the census rather says jail a\nHarvard law naval officer a jak deployed to SEAL Team won

over deployed with the seals\nOr they could take Rhonda sent us but CNN being ... and John Burma Nelson Kim rada Frank Bruni talking about it was Hamilton tickets play the music again and this is Frank Bruni tried to downplay\nWhat happened when we got him re\nI I think Trump is worse than the situation but I think in all fairness this predates Donald Trump and you know and I said correctly that Floridians have a high tolerance for this sort of thing I don't think it's confined to Florida I think most American voters to assume that politicians are not totally clean\nI mean they assume that they hang out with some people who may take favors from and that sort of thing and in the context of that honestly I don't think a single Hamilton ticket\nIs going to ruin Andrew Gillum campaign I also think\nThis new information is not does not resolve and solve everything I mean he's correct that test just sort of ambiguous he can say that that text does not prove that the ticket was from the FBI agent or from\nThe guy trying to buy influence that that that you know visually reference to the crew gives Andrew Gillum enough wiggle room to kind of say what are you saying I think a lot of this is just noise to voters\nGuy tickets in the room where it happened again you're on the subject of an FBI investigation\nI think it's not going to be limited to that Floridians vote for him they should expect to lose their governor mid term to corruption\nI'd vote for the census anyway because one of the centers deserve to be the governor of Florida\nThey are exactly what we need right now which is the protection of the free exercise clause within the Supreme Court\nAnd by the way the reason you both for senators like Martha ... and John James in Arizona and Michigan like Josh Hawley

the twentieth century um gap between the rich and the poor head first appeared really it was a sense of immigrants coming in abroad as scapegoats for the fact that the working class felt that they had

and the wage worker he had learned to\nSort of moderate his own blistering language which he had used early on he became a president rather than a campaigner and I think that's what we're looking for

York city Pittsburgh in Philadelphia with the Pittsburgh play so I sound like horrible but before I go to the president's tweets this morning your reaction to be a suspicious package is the most recent one of which was delivered to Robert De Niro what do you make of this\n[noise] uh you know I agree with Trump's with what the president said it's it's despicable I mean there there's no place for this I'm Glad they're vigorously investigating and I hope they catch you did it and uh catch them quickly and respond quickly I think that would be very appropriate\nAnd it ought to be condemned uh these kinds of tactics you I I wrote a column was about the violence of violent protests they have to be stepped on right away and um I I I I really liked the response at the highest levels of our government\nNow they um there's a new emphasis on a facility in Newcastle county Delaware I got a question Jeff it will not take the FBI very long to give them eight or nine or ten\nInvestigatory leads and that's what each of these packages is needed nine or ten of them they'll find whoever did this unless it's a hostile foreign power messing with our elections again and I'm not ruling out until I get a name and number whoever is doing this what do you make of that\nNo I ... nothing would surprise me\nI mean I ... we need to but I think we should be able to figure that out too now how much of this there'll be able to reveal up that's what it is is a different question you or I wouldn't rule anything out at this stage um and and they're doing exactly the right thing and investigating it very vigorously condemning it I'm\nNot I don't give me your assessment of the caravan what are we going to do when Twenty one thousand people show up at the border of the United states\nWell I think we have to force the laws of the United states and we do it in a way to insist that with the values of the United states that uh the H. S. has had a long time to plans and I assume that they have plans in place it does to me show why be nice to have a wall\nUm because it's a humane way of protecting the border and enforcing the laws so\nUh you know ... they're going to respond I think in an appropriate way and it shows also how the catch and release policies of a few years ago have incentivize people to try this\nYear I keep telling people that which gets rewarded gets repeated yes ... if if it Fifteen to twenty thousand people show up at the border and some our allowed in that will have forty or fifty thousand march I made it to happen\nIt's a it's a magnet effect and it's real and a number Romney talking about it you into and the two thousand twelve campaign um it's an issue by the way the judge how it's used here in Missouri Senator McCaskill co sponsored a catcher released bill\nBecause I got to play the senator McCaskill's new ad ... number two\nI don't always agree with Claire McCaskill work hard fighting against those terrorists doing all those town hall or carve out a braided dammed up against her own party and Claire is not one of those crazy Democrat works right in the middle and find All right\nJim Talent when you've got a democratic talking about crazy Democrats that's an attempt to not be Chuck Schumer is reliable vote does that work in Missouri is anyone fooled by that she'll vote for her to be the majority leader show vote for Dianne Feinstein to be the chairman of judiciary that's what she'd do\nWork against or senator McCaskill's had a bad few weeks you know beginning with the ... well beginning with the debate which uh which just it really well on despite the fact that the question is Raul hostile to even ask her about ...\nAh the chief video the bus or the bus tour when she did a ride in the bus and now this and look it's Democrats in Missouri who are who are really upset about this I'm\nSenator ... who's from a north St Louis county is saying hey this is who you're talking about are you talking about us when you're talking about crazy\nShe is talking about them she was talking about a Chuck Schumer Maxine Waters Nancy Pelosi you bet she's talking about them Jerry never\nRight and it's playing both ends against the metal and no it doesn't work and I'm really surprised that they looked at it you know I don't know what's happening in that I've seen some\n... not specifically and Josh is saying\nAbout Missouri that shows Republican intensities is way up now and that uh the suburbs are much stronger or for Republicans and they were even a month ago was very urging I was talking to us ... last night so I feel good about the trends here and I just hope that their national\nNo I I Know the president tweeted a very big part of the anger we've seen it in our country has caused by the purposely false inaccurate reporting in the mainstream media but I refer to as make new fake news has gotten so bad and hateful but it's beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast what do you make of that James Talent\n[noise] uh yeah I could not agree more you and you know it it was when I was running\nFor office then officer course of twenty five years I rarely criticized the media I just think the last few years they've gone completely off the rails and I don't see that as a Republican I mean his willingness to print anything uh just I mean and and this this this uh assumption of of a war\nI'm joined by meet the press has Chuck Todd\nHere I have both been on the road Chuck I've been down to ah Columbus Tampa Pittsburgh Philly New York city and I did get the Pittsburgh play you've been out on the road as well I Am curious as to what you heard even as we look at the breaking news overnight suspicious package addressed a Joe Biden being intercepted in Delaware this morning\nA looks like we missed each other and Tampa was your in your schedule when it looks like you have the same water voice that I Do yeah from all the dry air airplanes and et cetera [noise] actually what I learned you know the thing that is less they get their things and uplifting aggression someday but I Would say that\nThey let it slip extra pressure on me I go back to Phoenix, Arizona\nUm and how shell shock for all the taxes and having their first we'll competitive like the number of voters who complain to me about the negative ads Bush higher there than anywhere else and what I look at the places I weigh it gets to impose ...\nUm it's the first time the Knicks never really experienced Arizona literally experience one of these knock down drag out fights and I've ... boy go look to ... to\n... they've been doing dealing with with this for ten years um it it is interesting to me to watch the Phoenix independent voter toward out more so than any other place\nI like what about the cabinet affect what have you seen is an enduring my eye those but I think that what's her with Chuck Todd\nYeah no I Would say um I also hitting Missouri I it it is [noise] you know the jury race as slipped ... there's no other race\nThat I think outside of North Dakota I just hadn't drawn a dramatic more dramatic effect a post cabin on the Missouri\nWhich was one of my other stops I forgot embedded there um and then I Would say of the other places are linked Nevada's but the place and they have I think the second biggest impact\nI take less so than in Arizona and Texas looked\nActually she was a whole as a whole separate ball game when I was going to talk about the time when I Would\nSay Missouri and Nevada is where you could see steel here ...\nChevy Cruze is actually coming up right after I think he's listening to you right now what did you find in Texas\n[noise] you know it's interesting it's it's it's um\nThere's clearly increased turnout there's clearly ... an increasing agents that you see um [noise] but it's a race to stabilize they don't want I I ... when I Can't really put my head around is that when I when I compare I'm watching Beto O'Rourke running a red state as a Democrat\nAnd compared to here since it on my own Arizona\nCompared to frankly Claire McCaskill of Missouri Bill Nelson of Florida journal mansion and ah and uplifting Bredesen all of those other Senate Democrats I pointed out [noise] how are making some play for the center [noise]\nUm what I find fascinating and this was the great experiment at a selection is this is at Central park is it you know he's on a passionate about is is is positions just progressive ideals\nAre on one hand it's paid for I think it very clear choice between ... losers but it's probably the type of course a choice the cruise cruise a lot\nSo I ask him running ads saying\nThat because it it is you know I think you could make a case that it's possible he could have been bombed them different way I'm just going at a while or kids excited the Democratic base in taxes and I think it's a little bit bigger than I think any of us anticipated\nI I Can't you know part of me thinks boy she ran a little more like Phil Bredesen my guest is Ted Cruz would would be would be look he's acting like he's nervous or you know a lot of money that's been raised except for I think it'd be more than if\nI were gonna leave with their Chuck Todd and we'll see you tomorrow night on meet the press daily and of course if it's Sunday it was ... I Hope I Hope we both get our boys\nHome ... got to stay on the news reports birds [laughter]\nTalk to the jak now over to Ted Cruz senator from Texas who just started with a Chuck said I think he's thinking that was run away so far to the left what do you think\nThat we got ... with us Sen Cruz\nYeah I'm a I'm interview your Chuck what do you think I I I think\nThat's right I'm also glad to join the horse boys club like a two week that from election day at ... and anyone who spend their time doing politics that's a little bit of horses right now\nThey are um he he was saying beta was run hard left how can any have run hard left intact 'cause you get to\nAt you know that that has been in pain from the beginning that typically in Texas Democrats at least at least pretend to go to the middle and end from the very beginning\nA battle roar made the decision to go forward left he's running like Elizabeth Warren is running like Bernie Sanders not what it's resulting is meant\nThat money is the number one democratic fundraiser in the country ah last quarter a bed or walk raised ... million dollars that is the most money ever raised as a single quarter by any candidate for US Senate in history\nThat a lot of money and and and what happened is every time O'Rourke embraces a left wing position every time he comes out and calls for aging President Trump which he has\nMillions of dollars ... flood into the state every time they talked to a a abolishing liked what she has\nMillions of dollars flooded to the state and I think in many ways he is playing\nThe national liberal donors national liberal activists and and the people that he doesn't like it or or or actual voters in Texas who care about jobs and care about securing the border and care about the constitution a heat is responding to the interest of the people\nWithout Sen Cruz talked me a little bit about these nine a suspicious packages at least one of which was a real bomb\nThe president's condemn it the vice presidents condemned that Rod Rosenstein condemned I'm sure you're going to condemn it but the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either something not in the basement or it's a hospital power messing with our election but what do you make can be attempt to blame Trump\nI Love it it's the media dealing with the media does which which it any any narrative that they can twist against Trump they will do so\nAnd this is terrible I mean ... this is terrorism and whoever the terrorist is ... needs to be\nCaught you need to be prosecuted needs to be put in jail for a long long time and uh and and I thought that it that'll happen you know it's it's interesting you remember ... months ago uh we we had the bomb or in in Austin\nA that was setting up bombs throughout Austin and and I met with uh the ATF boats the FBI of we're leading the ads for sun and at the federal law enforcement had tremendous resources to put a bear it to track him down in terms of the components of the bomb I Know there I'm sure\nThey're analyzing all of those now\nWhere the cats has got to put it behind bars but but it is wrong violence is always role or wherever it occurs on the political spectrum I you know we saw tragically a year ago\nA appraised gunman\nComing to Washington DC or with the objective of shooting Republican Congress and and and ultimately go into the congressional baseball practice and and and shooting in nearly killing states elites an end\nTo this should not be part of our political discourse disagreement is fine even healthy to disagree on policy issues ah but but violence has no place it in and and and we need to be able to disagree with each other or with stability and with respect\nNo Senator Cruz you are cruising and that's great we need to back in D.C\nJust a final question to you about the Supreme Court which is now the the Thirty Years' war for the court is over at least for a time we have five conservative I Would argue originalist judges there when he regretted we get two or three more we've got twenty nine appeals court judges and fifty district court judges\nHow important is it that the Republicans keep the Senate and this is about more than ... fell in Arizona\nAnd my brought in Indiana and Josh ... how important is it the Republicans\nMaintain their control of the United states\nIt is massively important that the last two years at incredible victories off the people that the American the land and and if we can roll of the Senate\nOr either better what oh it was actually expand our our majority at a barely fifty one\nGetting up at three fifty four fifty five which I think it's a very real possibility um I think we could accomplish even more in a way to keep the house to get legislation through\nThe judicial side uh not only do we have two Supreme Court justices which I was proud to help lead the fight or both Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh but but we have been from the first year we confirmed more court of appeals judges that any time in history of the first year of the president's term\nWhite now today one at a six federal appellate judges of the country was appointed by President Trump's and and so it's made of the norm is difference\nOr if we have another two years I I I think we could see it as much as half\nOf the
