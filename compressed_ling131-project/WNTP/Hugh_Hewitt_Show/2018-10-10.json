would be proud of your family as well and family services\nOut Mr Vice president a UN ambassador Haley's announcement leaves us all a little bit started last time I saw what was it the swearing in Richard Grinnell to go to Germany he is on the shortlist to replace her along with Robert O'Brian admiral staff readers when you talk to the president what qualities as opposed to name you're going to urge him to look for in a UN ambassador\nWell before we look at the future let me say how how grateful we all our president myself\nOur entire ministry ... for the extraordinary job or that and bachelor Nikki Haley's done for the United states at the United nations or she is she has a tick you taking the president's America First agenda uh carried it\nInto the the for the United nations should choose to traveled around the globe advocating American interest uh and uh we will miss her in this role she is a personal friend of mine and\nShe and I spend a little bit of time or after she was in the oval office with the president and I just I just told her I personally grateful I was uh for for not only the job she's done but the way she's the way she's done it with courage and character and grace and we wish her and her family every blessing in the years ahead you\nVery tough act to follow so how do you follow it\nWhy they will be a decision for the president but uh there are a number of men and women ah that ah that that would be a very qualified very able to follow on\nIn that role but what I can promise you as the policies aren't going to change I mean one one of the things that has is I think than than most uh\nUh admirable about the job that ambassador Haley did at the United nations that are secretary's day my ... my ... who is doing now John Bolton is doing is is every single one of these folks and gets up every day or to carry the agenda that we were elected to advance\nOn behalf of the American people that America First agenda on to the world stage and so we're we're we're looking for folks that are that are not only can follow in the big shoes that Nikki Haley is going to leave at the un but we're we're going to be looking we're going to be looking to fill that spot a with someone who comes in with just as much bigger to advance\nAmerica's interest to advance the America First agenda and to and to continue to see of America um\nRespected again on the world stage you know Nikki made that comment in the oval office today and I I can tell you having\nHad the opportunity to travel around the world over\nThe last two years few um and uh I'll be headed to the Asia Pacific here in in about a month or as a as I've met with world leaders as I have witnessed or the response to President Trump's\nLeadership uh on on the world stage there's no doubt that America is respected again and that has a credit to the president the entire team and and uh and we are so grateful for the contribution to Nikki Haley's made to that causes well\nIt does take some sparkle on some charisma like ambassador Haley that's why I bring up Grinnell Robert O'Brian and and James ... we got to have some sparkle there\nWell look it's a it's the United nations is a big state\nAnd are having having the right talent they're all of those people are are outstanding people were other people there's actually there's a great number of people that have already expressed an interest in that position but I\nI I can tell you I'm I'm I have every confidence that the president or we'll we'll make sure that the United states is a once again well represented on the floor of the United nations and continues to advance to\nAdvance that uh agenda that's making such a difference of the American people and for American credibility in the
