{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "The Alice it was very subjective qualitative you know when we looked into this you you mentioned the the five rankings\nAre each ranking has sub category for example under stability the sub rankings are prevailing of petty crime prevails violent crime threat of terror threat of military conflict a third of civil unrest or conflict and these were all all the state of measures this was done by an expert in the area\nAnd an observer here locally so it was very qualitative or non American in in nature of this thirty ... sub criteria only four of them are quantitative only four of them has some kind of values usually from the world bank\nOr from Transparency International or or whether a temperature rankings precipitation rankings but at the rest of them\nYou know eighty seven percent were all all qualitative for example you know you you have in in in health care you know the fact that a private health care quality private health care availability of\nPublic health care quality public health care available to prescription over the counter drugs I mean just again very very generic very subjective criteria\nNow when we get into you know how the Pittsburgh ranking these sanctions and this is really where it's funny\nBecause in education Pittsburgh scored a perfect one hundred\nThat was their highest score now what we find funny was that you know the course on our side of the state you know we we've spent years and years looking at Pittsburgh public schools and the aging public K. through twelve education in the area\nAnd an education there's only three of the criteria in one's availability of private education seconds quality of private education is something called private education indicators of those three only the last one has a ... as a quantitative measure from the world bank\nBut they don't say what kind of education is in fact K. through twelve or is it colleges or is it both you know we really don't know\nAnd if you're you know I guess if you're real interested in real curious about their methodologies they'll give you solve it on the website but you have to pay for the article and that's like four thousand dollars to get to the details so we'll go from there but you know when you get into these rankings you know we've looked at Pittsburgh public schools they're underperforming their expenses are twenty thousand dollars of student\nHeck he was a about a year and a half ago there was a group called\nThe great city schools I mean they ... the city on the fact that\nThey hadn't had any real academic improvement over ten years from two thousand seven two thousand Seventeen so it's not just us we know that the quality of public education around here is not all that terrific especially in the city of Pittsburgh and the fact they score perfect one hundred just kind of raise an eyebrow\nYeah that is pretty surprising and again somewhere where you would think somebody could go to come off of Pennsylvania's website look at the education rankings or you know whatever indicated want to say okay this is one where you just have\nHowever they're putting these random together is going to compare your city to city on education says another surprising one was infrastructure [laughter]\nI Know they're going to be our road network and things are going underneath the ... well or not great qualities house a little bit about that for\nAgain infrastructure came in had Ninety six point four out of one hundred\nAnd infrastructure what was really funny to us and if those of listen to our program before was a quality of water provision what makes us laugh is in Pittsburgh water and sore three which is over a hundred years old it springs leaks all the time\nThey figure it's going to cost them five billion dollars replace the entire system they're just now getting around thinking about replacing the entire system is so bad the over the summer\nThe state legislature put Pittsburgh water and sore authority under the oversight of the Pennsylvania utility commission so it's so bad that they had the states have the state come in and and keep tabs on them and they're going to put together they're forced to put together a long term infrastructure plan and and that the class I'll pass rate hikes part of the PUC and\nAnd and they really under this oversight so how could a city with a water system as bad as Pittsburgh rank Ninety six points for on the system and again like you said you know we all know about Pennsylvania roads you know potholes are us um you know this is certainly another area where we can't really see quality of road network being all that great\nIt's especially at this we don't have a in Pittsburgh we don't have a belt where all the roads lead into the city I'm not really sure what kind of qualitative measures they were using on that one\nWow that's interesting stuff Frank and we'll close there on this live ability topic but again our listeners can always visit our website which is W. W. W. dot Allegheny interest you talk or to see this brief\nAnd look a little bit more in depth on the economist ranking in another one as well to deal with not the city but also the ... the the metro area which is larger and how that rank and came about\nFour Frank camera this is Eric ... party and this has been the Allegheny Institute report on the Lincoln Institute radio journal\nThe left and the ride our uniting behind a wide range of criminal justice reform issues here was this week's Lincoln radio journal commentary is better and Mumford from Americans for prosperity Pennsylvania\nThere's been a lot of talk lately about our nation's criminal justice policies and the barriers their act to citizens in need of a second chance\nRoughly Ninety five percent of all incarcerated individuals will eventually be released from prison and will return to our communities sadly statistics show that about Seventy five percent of them will re offend within five years of their release fortunately Washington lawmakers have a chance to\nFight this crisis the U.S house of representatives recently passed the first step back\nBipartisan legislation aimed at ending the revolving door every citizen\nBy rehabilitating inmates in equipping them with the tools in training they need to successfully reintegrate into our communities now is the Senate turned support reforming our nation's prisons improving public safety and extending second chances to those who have served their time\nBy using evidence based rats and needs assessment tools the bell will provide job training treatment education and other programming\nThat will help incarcerated individuals return as productive in law abiding members of society this approach has already been demonstrated to work in a handful of states that have enacted similar reforms\nState Senate implemented these programs have experienced the drop in crime and incarceration a lower likelihood of recidivism and have saved billions in tax payer dollar's Pennsylvania can joined the list of states advancing reforms and advancing programs that keep our community safe\nLow reforming our criminal justice policies considering the Pennsylvania currently has fifty three hundred people serving life without parole our court sentenced people their life in prison without the possibility of parole at one of the highest rates and then he said in a state with less than four percent of the U.S population\nWe have ten percent of all such prisoners it cost taxpayers more than forty two thousand dollars a year to house each prisoner but elderly prisoners who typically pounds less risk to public safety after release can cost as much as nine times more\nThan younger prisoners and in Pennsylvania too out of five serving life without parole or fifty year old their state senators Sharif street a Philadelphia has introduced legislation\nThat would address this by allowing for consideration of parole\nAfter an inmate has served Fifteen Years in a life sentence that means almost two thirds of those now incarcerated for life would be able to go before the parole board\nMore than half of those serving life without parole in Pennsylvania where twenty five or younger when they entered prints and sick and elderly prisoners who would pose a little risk to the public if they return to their communities deserve a measure of compassion and their\nFinal years rather than what the abolitionist Law Center refers to as death by incarceration beyond reforming the parole process the legislatures should also address are rigid mandatory minimum sentencing for third strike offenses\nJudges need to be able to impose punishments that fit the crime that means taking into consideration the unique factors and each case and the defendants record three strikes and you're outlines are responsible for many of the injustices in life without parole sentences\nThey undermine the public's concept and justice and reduce respect for the law they also needlessly increase the cost of our prison system laugh or a a crucial goal of the parole system reform should be to increase the chances that released inmates can succeed outside of printing\nThat will happen only if they have access to effective evidence based re entry assistance plans such programs can improve the lives of former prisoners as they return to their communities and work to reclaim their life\nThey also reduced recidivism keeping the public saver and said and tax dollars we are not as a society that rejects help indeed we're society that believes in the moral imperative\nRedemption we know that everyone deserves a second chance our criminal justice system should reflect those values and right now is that isn't right here in Pennsylvania we should our during legislature to adopt the types of reforms\nThat have worked in other states to not only save taxpayer dollars that help return as many people as possible to

him to places now the question is are you making in preparation for where you're going to spend they turned it they're only two places one of them is called the lake of fire\nAnd so the preparation for that is to do nothing that is you don't have to do anything at all they ended up there but my friend if you're planning on going to heaven there are some steps the preparation is saying well I think I'm going\nWell the question is what have you done\nTo prepare to spend the eternity with God and all other believers in heaven\nAnd that is the theme of the entire message and that is preparing for heaven and I want you if you will to turn to revelations chapter Twenty one [noise] and all those three the first six versus if this chapter and this is the ... John who is writing about what he saw concerning heaven\nBeginning in the first version of the twenty first chapter the revelation he says and I saw a new heaven and a new or for the first one and the first or\nPassed away and there is no longer in his seat\nAnd I saw the holy city of new Jerusalem coming down out of having from God made ready abroad at dawn for her husband and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying\nBeholder Tabernacle of God is among men and he showed well among them and they should be his people and got himself Shelby among them\nAnd he's your wife ... from their eyes and their she'll no longer being to death their show no longer be in the morning all crying or pain the first things have passed away and he sits on the throne said behold I'm making all things new and he said a right to these words are faithful and through\nAnd he said to me it is done I Am the ... and the omega but beginning in the end I Will give to the one who first from the spring of the water of life without cost now when\nJohn writes the revelation what he's writing is what he has for what he is in the process of seeing nobody can fully understand all that heaven has the simple reason that I find I minds are confined to some degree the earthly understanding\nI'm not going to spend time trying to describe the ... going to be like but rather\nTo prepare to get there now the first question I Want to ask is what are we going to do when we get there\nA lot of people have a lot of conjecture about that\nBut there for very specific things the Bible says that you and I are going to do when we get to heaven as I Want us to look at them and then I Want us to look at this matter of how do we prepare so in order to talk about how we prepare and why we should talk about that let's ask the question what are we going to do their so\nTherefore things that I Want you to take note up in the book of revelation go back to chapter for for a moment\nOne of the things we're going to do when we get to heaven as we're going to praise God and worship him and throughout the book of the revelation that describes future things there are a number of passage is not versus but sections versus that describe this look if you will and burst nine of the fourth chapter\nAnd window living creatures give ... thanks to him who sits on the throne to him or lives forever and ever and the twenty four elders will fall down before him who sits on the throne animal worship him who lives forever and ever and were cast that crowns before the throne saying listen war they are\nOur lord and our God to receive blower and honoring power outage create all things and because of that will they existed and were created\nLindbergh sample the next chapter noticed what he says and I looked and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne living creatures and elders\nAnd the number of them was ... and thousands of thousands\nSaying with all our boys were the is the land that was playing the receive power and riches and wisdom in mind and honoring during blessing and every traded thing which is in heaven and all of the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things and then I heard saying to him loose sits on the throne the land the blessing an honoring Lauren dominion forever and ever\nAnd the ball it increases kept saying a man and The Elders fell down and worship\nWell these are just two examples of scripture apt description in the book of revelations that describe what's going on in heaven lettuce praised the God and worship praise\nAnd worship involves personal involvement and what is going on it is a God directed feeding\nWe're thinking about him and praising him an adoring him and loving him and if you and I go into having my friend and spend the rest of eternity praising and worshipping God we need to learn how while we're down here and get started with getting on to worship\nThe living holy God who has become our savior\nHe says we're going to be praising him in the heavens the angels everyone is praising the Lord Jesus Christ and magnifying him for his great work of redemption\nUh second thing he says we're going to do he says we're going to shine for him or to the world does that mean go back if you will to Matthew chapter Thirteen\nAnd the thirteenth chapter Matthew the passage deals with the judgment that is the final separation of the righteous and the un righteous\nAnd listen to what he says beginning in the for the first verse the son of men will send both his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all stumbling blocks and those who commit lawlessness and will cast them into the furniture so far and that place now she'll be weeping and gnashing of teeth then then the righteous\nHallelujah that's not a thing in this world you can do about it and not one thing\nWhat what did we say we said first of all that is the preparation of the spirit about regeneration preparation of the soul by being conform confirmation The Likeness of Christ and thirdly the preparation of the body by friends formation look if you will and the Libyans chapter three ... three look at versed on it\nFor our citizenship is in heaven from which also we eagerly wait per se via the Lord Jesus Christ who will do what transformed the body\nAs physical body about humble state into conformity with the body of his glory that his his glorious glorified unlimited body unlimited by the time unlimited by space unlimited by anything by the exertion all the expression\nOf the power that is his supernatural power that he has even the subject all things to himself that go back to first Corinthians chapter Fifteen and let's look at birth forty nine fifty fifty one fifty to\nFirst falling on he says now and just as we have\nBorne the image of the earth is that is just as in this life\nWe have borne the image of earthly human beings\nWe shall also ... the image of the heavenly that is the glorified body now I say this president flesh and blood to not inherit the kingdom of God that is something must happen to this body so he says here's what's gonna happen and here's when they hold I'll tell you a mystery\nWe shall not all sleep that

things like that is a pretty strong case for demanding repentance for for giving it also seems like repentance is necessary for for giving other people and loop Seventeen versus three and four be on your radar Jesus said if your brother or sins rebuke can and\nYes he re pants forgive them burst for and is he sends against to seven times a day and returns for you seven times saying I read parents forgive him now\nNo argument seems pretty are tied doesn't that first of all and God requires us to repent before we receive forgiveness and second it leaves the Bible says we're to forgive others in the same way that God for gives us a vision for thirty\nTwo doesn't it seem logical that we can only forgive those who are ... of their sin against us case closed or not so quickly\nBecause such a conclusion say with me on this fails to take into consideration the difference between receiving forgiveness from God there are other people and brain think forgiveness to others\nRepentance is absolutely necessary to receive forgiveness from another person or from God\nBut it has nothing to do with granting forgiveness for somebody who was hurt us and so when we're talking about this\nDo people have to repent before they're forgiven we need to know the audience to whom were staking or we speaking to the offender or the offended when meal is right that for you about Huck Finn comes to me and says you know one my wife called me red handed I've been having an extramarital affair and\nI don't know what I can do to get her to forgive me\nWhat am I going to say to him I'm going to say no buddy you better come crawling on your knees through your wife you better bag her for your forgiveness you better admit to her that what you did was wrong\nPromise that you will never never do it again\nFor his point of view the one lady forgiveness repentance is vital\nI Would say to him don't expect your wife to forgive you if you are unwilling to repair didn't have a change of direction\nBut suppose instead of him coming to me the wife comes to me she says past Rob discovered my husband is having a fair and I was so angry I just don't know what to do I'm obsessed by this I Can't let go of it what should I Do\nSuddenly I'm Talking to another party\nAnd what I said to her is\nYou need to for gas I plan to her forgiveness doesn't need a racing the consequences of what your husband is done I claim that forgiving doesn't even guaranteed that the marriage will continue but want forgiveness is is letting go\nOf my ride to settle the score it's letting go of my right to hurt somebody for hurting me for her to forgive her husband me\nI'm giving me my husband over to God I'm gonna let God suck up the score with them or other people's subtle the score wear them I'm not going to hold onto that ... as in my own heart I counseled hurt to forgive\nUnconditionally\nNot necessarily be reconciled but there for gifts so that she can be free to get on with her life you've heard you say that it's often you know letting go of a rattlesnake\nMay benefit the snake but it benefits you a lot more to let go of it the same way with bitterness forgiveness sledding do me a fit our offender but it benefits us much more we need to know the audience that we're speaking to forgiveness\nCan be granted without repentance it can never be received without\nRepentance\nLet's talk about this word repentance for just a moment what does the word read can mean we hear it all the time repent repaint repent what does the word really mean the word repentance comes from a Greek word ... no way oh\nLiterally means to change anyone's mind now this isn't just an intellectual changing of the mind and his or change your mind\nThat leads to a change of direction in life many times when I'm driving down to church I come down the hallway and I get all fed Harry Heinz and I'll be going down Harry Heinz which is one way and it seems like more frequently I\nSee a motorist to his lost his way in downtown Dallas trying to figure out where to go and he's in their late coming the wrong way down Harry Heinz for me I see this all the time and so I'm driving and I'm seeing this guy coming towards me and I just wonder how long is it going to take him\nTo realize all the headlights are facing him he's doing the wrong direction sometimes it's a media sometimes you get dangerously close to me and the other cars and do these lands on the brakes realizes what he's done a U turn and starts going in the right direction\nNow that is a perfect picture of what repentance is repentance means having a change your mind and means realizing you're going down the wrong direction and deciding to take action turn around and just start going in a new direction that is biblical repentance\nAnd there are some instances in which ... says absolutely necessary in factor of for instances in which the Bible says we must repent\nFirst of all jumped these down three pensions is necessary for receiving God's forgiveness is necessary for receiving God's forgiveness remember God took the first mood and saving us just like the\nFather of the prodigal son did he made the first move when he sat Christ to die for us Romans five ... says\nMy God demonstrators Lockport us in the ... we were yet centers have sent cries to die for us hey the first move but we must free pants in order to receive that forgiveness\nWasn't lures or first John one versus eight or nine although first John was written to Christians not non Christians it's still reveals a universal principle birth date says if we say that we have no San we're\nDeceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we can fast SARS fans that's another word for repent if we can pass our fans hey as faithful and ride just to forgive us of our sins and the Clintons us for all on righteousness\n[noise] one church father said it this way he said God only gives the gift of forgiveness to those whose hands are empty\nOnly when we open our hands\nOnly when we let go a bar denials of our sinfulness are rationalization our excuse there's only one our hands are empty can we receive God's forgiveness only when we say to God God I'm tired of arguing with you you're right\nI've been doing them the wrong direction I'm ready to turn around I'm ready to receive your gift or forgiveness only then\nAre we truthfully forgiven repentance is absolutely necessary for receiving forgive the secondly repentant those necessary for reconciliation with another person\nIt's absolutely necessary for reconciliation with another person wild God requires me to unconditionally forgive the business partner who treats me he doesn't require me to stay in business wedding\nThere's a difference I can forget that business partner for cheating may I don't have to stay in business with him until he repentance daily shows and the knowledge of what he was doing this wrong in fact I\nWould be a fool to continue to stay in business with an unrepentant sheet forgiveness\nHas absolutely nothing to do with reconciliation number three repentance as necessary for respiration to a position that we've lost\nYou don't make you chat for Eighteen this is so important to understand and Jesus describes two kinds of sends sins against the body of Christ and personal fans\nYou know and Matthew Eighteen Twenty one Peter came to the lord and said lord how many time show somebody thin\nAgainst me and I forgive them up to seven times and Jesus said no up to Seventy times seven and then he told that terrible about the king and the unforgiving slave but what Peter was asking about lord what about personal offenses things that hurt me\nHe doesn't say demand repentance first he said just forgive\nLet go let somebody else out all the score\nBut earlier and Matthew Eighteen versus Fifteen to twenty Jesus was addressing sins against the body of Christ what do you do when you come across a Christian whose life is being destroyed by thin and who's saying is hurting the church it's hurting the reputation of price in the community\nOur medical bills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our

judgment so God is already written down your death day he's written down when you're finished\nThird question is will you allowed to catch up to the end of the story\nBecause women in counting the income but the question is well you have fulfilled the purpose\nBut he has designed for you in this for a Trump for example\nFor the building building building\nYou know just starting to go get some

it and when you're walking catches up to him busy enough that you fulfill your destiny but if you walk in another direction other than his design you are not fulfilling your destiny\nAnd it's like you're on your own is like Jonah when he decided to go the other way that God intended he was on his own\nAnd so many of us are on our own not headed toward our destiny because we don't recognize that

a lot of us want to say I want to see what and then God I tell you if I Walk\nBut God you know you walk by face not by site so you respond to what\nAnd then I'll show you what's next [noise] okay\n[noise] so that's where the faith comes in it God has created a juicy piece of crap and you for\nA purpose you know he gave out I'm On the time he said here's the garden and I want you to attend that that's your assignment\nThey gave him a specific tasks to do with the devil this mess up the assignment\nThat's the devils job he wants to mess up the assignments so you don't fulfill the assignment so you have to get booted out of the garden\nWants to mess up the assignment by getting off the act independently of God and when you act independently of dog was the great send in the Bible to act independently of God to keep guard name and hang out with the church and all that but to live my life independently of him if the devil can get you to do that\nHe can get these are deemed to your light illegitimate lakes so then you come to the end of the life not being able to say I'm finished\nCity and it's not you have to\nLive in the heat and have fun and you know do all the lights stop at nothing wrong with that\nThat to your doctor they will always be something biblical that benefits others for which gets going for what you might have been you need\nTo do was talk your debt to the promised land but because they refused to walk back bay wondering died in the world and now we live in their destiny\nNot reaching the place God in designated for them to be that leads us to who is you are finally\nI Want you to know who is you are 'cause that's critical to this notice reverse ten says it says we are his workbench ship created Christ Jesus which\nYou can get prepared beforehand that we should walk in it\nIs Christ Jesus God prepared have you bought something something expensive and appliance or television or something and you bought it\nAnd it didn't work\nYou know how frustrating it is to buy something particularly if it costs you a pretty penny and you get home\nAnd it don't work you are evangelical frustrated [noise]\nYou know why you're so frustrated because of the price you pay to get it\nTo say if you paid a high price you expected to work right [noise]\nIt is unfortunate that Jesus has pay this higher price and they can't get his folks\nYou know not a frustrating thing about something expensive and it works sometimes\nIf you're like working day and don't feel like we're going to Mars feel I work in the day he would you be happy with the refrigerator that felt like cool in the day but didn't feel like calling them off for stole the felt like cooking the day and didn't feel like cooking them all a can opener that felt like open a can of the day and then the next thing is on and talking about an indicator of the day you know you're\nToaster pops up the bread and popped up one where he got for things in the other thing I Want to come up right\nBe happy with that you don't pick up the price you expected of performance that would respond [noise] some attached to the to the price to pay\nThe price Jesus Christ don't cry for not for you to the side of the Christian sometimes [noise]\nYou know what God and saying you\nOh my workmates ship I have the right away you know on the lam adjust\nTo me or as you said not mind will but I Will be done when you\nSit mentality not mine but we don't know you want to work when shit I don't want to thank God Bless me and that's OK to ask God Bless you but what God wants to know is Kenny bless you in his will\nOh you're willing to say God\nDon't understand I'm not even like it but because you you know I Know\nAnd see where you take [noise]\nGuard here's what God says the reason you do not here is that you do not belong to God and the Jews answered him aren't we right in saying that you're a Samaritan and dean and possess\nThat's their response to Jesus\nAnd it is in light of that that they challenged this sign that they challenge this mythical and they challenged the testimony of this particular individual\nBut if they thought they could intimidate him they are discovering either they actually can that this man has a little bit of metal to him and he is able to respond very clearly a second time they Simon him we know this man is a center they said and then look at his reply inverse twenty five\nWhether these are centered or not I don't know one thing I Do know I was blind but now I see\nIn other words he's released asked them if I don't know about what you know but I Do know what I Know and why is that I was was blind but now I can see\nI mean you seem to be says have all these kind of inferences and all these assertions and all these observations about Jesus and ah I'm listening to what you're saying but I'm standing before you as a testament to the fact of what has happened I was a blind man but now I can see\nWhat I'm kind of at a future ... ... it's hard to face\nAnd recognizing it invest twenty six the ferrets these retreat to the questions that they'd been asking previously ... what did he do to you how did he open your eyes if you look\nUp diverse Fifteen that's exactly what they had asked them before\nThe parents he said that I also asked him how he had received a site now they're back asking the same question now I I may be that this is indicative of their interrogation style if your\nIn the tech to programs and I must confess I don't watch any of the contemporary ones I I have no interest in them but if you give me some old ones I can go back there with your\nHand there's some old British ones particularly but that's\nJust my problem but I always enjoyed the situation where the person who was accused was taken into the white walled room with a single table and two chairs\nOne for the detective and one for the accused and then the detective would run through the questions the man would answer the questions the detective would stand up walk out the door close it and leave the man there\nNext scene the detective returns sits down on the chair as the exact same questions all over again\nGet ... walks out the door slams adore comes back next time he says would you like a cigarette and the guy said yes please or gay cigarette lights up\nAccent the exact same questions all over again\nYou say there's a what's up with us detective who have run out of questions\nYou know what he's doing is he is repeatedly going through the same stuff in the hope that somewhere along the line he will be able to identify\nAn inconsistency and the man's responds and thereby the evil to get leverage so as to further conviction that may well be that that's what they're doing that they're hoping that if they keep asking him to say the same thing over again\nHis account of what took place well actually contradicted yourself\nFor that may be and I think this is more likely that the reason they asked these two questions again in first twenty six because they run out of steam they are just run out of steam there is no air left in their balloon there is nothing left for them to say they are\nConfronted by this convertible evidence\nAnd standing on the side of truth the man inverse twenty seven\nTakes the offensive\nWe've already been through all of this he says I've told you this already you didn't listen to the first time I can't believe you want me to tell you again unless of course you want to become his disciples to swell\nNotice incidentally the progression in this land thinking\nBack inverse eleven when they asked him how his eyes wide open dissent the man they call Jesus\nThe manic oh Jesus a inverse Seventeen as they press him he says of Jesus he he is a profit\nHere invest twenty seven he recognizes that Jesus as of such a stature that there are those who are would become his disciples and his followers but now\nThe argument or the interrogation I don't think it's fair to call it a conversation that was much more than that but it is not reached the tipping point\nAnd the man has forced his accusers to play their hand they're going to have to show what they have in their hand\nThey've played poker game on this dialogue for long enough he's calling it showing me while you've got and what are they got\nAnd so they do what always happens when the weakness of an individual's argument becomes obvious the resort to insults when you know longer of anything else that you can say to substantiate your claim the chances are you going to say something like you're ugly and your mother dressed as you funny\nAnd at that point the person that you are arguing with knows he or she has got you because you now have nothing to say that is logical or progressive are challenging and you're just all you've got left\nIs to start slinging insults around and that's exactly what they did versus twenty eight graphic says that they threw their unsolved sided claiming again the high ground up their theological background we are the disciples of Moses we know that God spoke to Moses\nBut as for this fellow this person that you're on about we don't even know where he comes from\nWe haven't got a clue\nWhile of course I wasn't actually true because Jesus had already been involved in a dialogue with them you can turn by one page again and I pointed out to you\nIn the conversation where they're challenging the testimony of Jesus\nJesus as an inverse twenty three of Johnny you are from below\nI Am from above you are of this world I'm not of this world I told you that you would die and your sins if you do not believe that I Am the one I claimed to be you will indeed die in your sins who are you there is just what I've been claiming all along Jesus reply\n\nSo there was some ironic sense in which they didn't know where he was wrong but there was another very realistic sense in which they did know\nAnd it was a very things that he said concerning his origins\nThat offended that and they refused to accept what he said\nLeon Morris or who's commentary on John is arguably one of the finest observes in their response of the mind inverse therapy here he says the man's chain of reasoning is pretty good for someone for being a bad or all his life\nAnd presumably a stranger to academic and forensic argument\nThis man is not in any doubt as tall as to what has taken place for him and so look at how we answers inverse therapy I'll paraphrase it from far for him\nHe says to them as I find is truly remarkable you're\nOn belief in the face of the evidence is more of a miracle than my cure\nThe fact that you don't believe in light of the evidence\nIs more remarkable to me than the fact that I can actually see because there is a basis for not being able to see mainly an encounter with Jesus and you have seen what Jesus has done\nAnd you refused to set your eyes tell you the more remarkable he says that in a fight that I Am now seeing individual and he jumps on the back of that and he uses their same form of argumentation\nPointing out we know that God does not listen to the centers\nIn other words what he uses is a logistic argument do you remember that from school but we don't need to go there but in other words he starts from premise and sub premise and conclusion the very pro says that they had used backup inverse sixteen this man is not from God premise for he doesn't keep the saddest some premise therefore\nHe couldn't have done the exact same thing again in sixteen be others said how can a sinner do such miraculous science see an argument\nOn what the men dozens exact same thing he says one we are all a dream that God doesn't listen to centers I don't I doubt on central you if you are aware of the
