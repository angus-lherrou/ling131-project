Republican libertarian vegetarian\nMcCain Republican Romney Republicans Bush Republican you're mad as hell because we're all United that this is unfair what they're doing it this good man cannot than so the Republican year will be a Democrat and Republican you been able to do something my friends on the other side I could never did not this party\nHer listening this morning so pleased a welcome back from the United States Senate representing Iowa the great state of Iowa senator Joni Ernst hello senator urged\nOh good morning he'll how're you doing\nI'm great I I Want to give you a a GPS on where we are this morning show I spent the first hour talking only two women first time caller just talked to a Catholic in Scranton and in Dallas Sarah in Tampa\nIn and Detroit was a teenage son Norma in Michigan Alexandria Newport Beach California a lame in Louisville\nUnion Oregon showing in Columbus and in San Diego ... started colors all of them want Kelvin are confirmed nine out of ten of them support what the president said last night one wish the hat and set it and they all\nDon't believe Dr ... testimony though they are all very sympathetic and indeed one as a daughter who's ... survivor of sexual assault that's just a slice of what I've been hearing what have you been hearing\nWell I Am hearing of course a mixture of the calls I get to the office a lot of them are are saying\nGet Kavanaugh confirmed and then there are others that um are you know adamantly opposed we see those folks on the TV all the time um but uh what I Do hear when I'm Out and about and people just can't understand um why we haven't moved on with a getting him confirmed\nThey understand that he has the right to um credentials to sit on the nation's highest court and they fully expect that we should get this done soon\nOut a ... I Do not believe the president was mocking the idea of someone being assaulted last night he was poking holes and testimony and I want to review a few things with you about the testimony first of all there was a story in Politico that she had a fear of ... which is why that had to be the way it should never actually feel better so but\nThat was represented the committee she did say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers her former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she's familiar with polygraph they'd never discuss sexual assault\nOr they knew real clear investigations report that the\nSecond front door contractor evidence shows it was not about claustrophobia but a second entrance for an office\nThere wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's a ritual Mitchell Report I simply do not believe that that testimony could knock Brett Kavanaugh of consideration\nNo I'd I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I Do honestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point or do I sure do I I I think most folks would agree with that however um even the witnesses that she called forward\nActually uh can't corroborate or simply tear down that the testimony that she gave about um uh some party that she had attended so unfortunately um for for her\nI don't find that to be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think she experienced trauma but I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have the secondary assault on judge cup and all I Do not know by the way who's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters caught maybe attending the fourteen year old\nWill be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people are not stood up to a to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is but none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse is allegation\nWas libel and slander as an immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and and stand by judge cabin on your view\n[noise] well I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh of course she won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media um but we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put through um the\nThe worst possible situation ever with\nTheir father being demeaned and an discredited and and it's very unfortunate and we'd have those discussions on why would anybody want to step up be nominated for such an important\nPosition why would anybody want to run for office if it simply takes an accusation and unproven accusation which can put a family literally through how\nDuring the alert who would be the chairman of how judiciary if the Democrats take the house that's a very scary thought here said he is going to open impeachment hearings based upon the judges perjury nothing he said I'm I've been doing this for thirty five years remotely approaches perjury as a lawyer not that they're not a single\nUnder a viable assertion that he made he characterizes drinking who did not denies drinking ... why would anyone take that seriously\nWell at just look around here it's all about obstruction it's about resistance and as about what can we stop and put in the president's way what can we put in Congress his way to stop them from doing a better job for the United states of America\nI mean look at our economy and how strong we are doing right now and and know thanks to our counterparts across the aisle they have tried to slow us down stop us at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it is\nAs stopping the tax cuts and JOBS Act what ever it is\nThey try and delay delay resist um and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the house we can expect that for the next two years\nNow I have been calling this frequently on law and the new McCarthyism because McCarthyism as the taking of a very serious charge that's been proven in other contexts in that case originally treasonous conduct against the Rosenberg perjury by his and the signing it to the Hollywood screenwriters that's McCarthyism\nThis McCarthyism is taking people like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and they're horrible crimes and attributing them\nTo a cabinet and I think people need to stand up and say this was hysterical and it's deeply unfair senator\nAnd as it is absolutely unfair and it is absolutely ridiculous\nIf you look around the Senate you can point fingers here too and members that have added admittedly I'm had bad behavior and they're in their past which probably surpasses any accusation that has been\nLeveled against Brett Kavanaugh so I think people should tread very lightly on the things that they are throwing at this respectable\nMan and his family they don't want it to come around five fold against them in the future so um we just need to do a better job here in the United states at teaching our children what is appropriate behavior what is not appropriate behavior\nAnd then of course I'm just doing better as society but for other members to kind of laugh about what they did in their college days and then a point the finger at Brett Kavanaugh on say you are not qualified to serve on our nation's highest court because you drank beer and high school or college you know shame on you\nThey had better start thinking twice about what they're doing\nYou know a ... boy cry of campaign within four and I believe to be a third decent man he actually had good faith and the Democrats who's been proven wrong of course they did not use this to wait for the FBI report they immediately ...\nHave you got any sense when the FBI is going to finish and therefore a motion for cloture filed do you have a timetable\nI Do think that we will say that this week I think the FBI as probably winding down as as we are speaking out with their witnesses and I know that our leader is very intent on getting this uh voted on this week so as soon as we can receive the report\nI Do think it is important to a review\nThe information and the report for the supplemental investigation um we need to know that for our constituents just be able to verify you know everything is okay if everything does check out and then we move forward and and have that same wrapped up but I Would anticipate um as the leader has said that he wants to see it down this way\nHave you heard any I've heard that possibly be FBI report will be done today and culture filed tonight have you heard that\nUh I have heard some semblance of that\nBut um again I I Would hesitate to say that on on a national program I just think that uh we have to make sure that we are going through the report that we have had time to absorb it and make sure that we're able to push back to our our constituents that everything has got to go and then we move forward do\nYou expect at this point at this point obviously with a report to review that you will be voting for judge governor\nI well I'm unless there is something that surfaces and they are in the investigative report that you know the supplemental report that would corroborate talked forwards testimony unless that happens I plan to support judge Kavanaugh\nAnd last thing I Want to play pea Lindsey Graham on on a Sean Hannity last but cut number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats are they they're toast old all over ... uh do you agree with that senator limiting the go ahead\nI Do I absolutely agree with an underground and and uh Lindsey has been a hero through this process he\nClearly phase what is going on and he has been able to demonstrate that and and clear concise and language for every one which we all appreciate uh but I Do believe that those are Democrats that are in red states those are up this year they are going to have a very very difficult time if they do not support judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they're also they're also a Joni Ernst just said

you hearing in your district\nYou know I was at a a couple of parade this weekend and then just running around northeast council meeting with a bunch of people so this is the typical significant but I certainly had a lot of people both men and women come up to me saying they were just very\nDisgusted with the way the political circus played out in the Senate and I do think it's transparent that there are many Democrats who\nAre just trying to delay this past election and we're like nothing more than two delayed seeping bill\nAnd sell perhaps the Democrat can win the presidency and twenty twenty and I think even if you're right in the middle right let's say you're not committed part of that one way or the other I think there is a general sense that okay elections have consequences and it is and the president right in the authority to nominate\nSomeone a and that judge Kavanaugh none of the allegations against them have been corroborated in any way and I just would drop people's attention to the nine page memo that the outside prosecutor Rachel Mitchell\nSent to the Senate on Sunday and while your average person I think not and if they're going to read that and I'm ... I'm reading your average politician right rarely read more than\nOne page [noise] um I Do think it expresses a what I found to be the common sense and in fact in my district this weekend which is to say we have enormous sympathy for Dr Ford but\nNone of the accusations she has made so far has had any iota of cooperation and that has to be the standard right we can't have a standard where you can make any accusation without any cooperation and that's enough to destroy some of life for no other reason than no capable people will want to serve in public office\nGoing forward but I also point out and and Joni Ernst confirmed all this uh there are enormous gaps in holes in her testimony the fear of flying story did not pan out not aware that the committee would come to her that would be on her lawyers her ex boyfriend has now sworn under oath said she's familiar with polygraph there's a second news story\nOn the second door having nothing to do with claustrophobia there wasn't a single verifiable assertion not one that could be proven in her testimony\nBut you don't know about raspberry carrying and Kirk um and then you don't know how to mix them up and the scientists at ... dot com and taken all the gas work out of it they have made the Fort built packed the easiest to swallow the easiest to open the easiest to\nTake costs Nineteen Ninety five to go to relieve factor dot com and get your first three weeks' supply [noise] Nineteen dollars and Ninety five cents don't wait another day really factor dot com relief factor dot com boom\nComing back with Tim Alberta we'll talk about the politics of this Lindsey Graham Joni Ernst they all say they're toasted they vote against cabin up they're not this is the shoo shoo shoo [noise]\nDo you have type one or type two diabetes is your stomach full after just a few bites are overwhelmed by nausea vomiting and abdominal pain\nYou may be suffering from diabetic gastro ... doctors are looking for volunteers for an important research study evaluating an investigation will drug for these symptoms go to my stomach study dot com to see if you qualify\nYou must be at least Eighteen years old have type one or type two diabetes\nAnd have experienced some or all of these symptoms for at least three months study related drugs doctor visits and test will be provided to you at no cost compensation for time and travel may be available for qualified participants for more information and and see if you qualify called two one five\nFive one five seven four to three or visit my stomach study dot com that's two one five five one five seven four to three or visit my stomach study dot com called today two one five five on five seven\nFour to three my stomach study dot com [noise]\nWow those awful smells they won't go way\nHigh is just beat the other guy from ... with a powerful way to neutralize the odors that their source noted on\nSmelly sports gear and trash cigarettes especially patterns in the same same formula developed for the toughest industrial waste and voted on saying for the environment get strong enough to eliminate the industrial science sewage treatment plants and steals things for the rest unlike other products that just mask smell\nButtered owns you need formula plan extracts attack owners after shores to neutralize the moon contact\nVoted almost completely safe around pets and children even the strongest diapers smells owner going lingering huge fish onion garlic voted on cigarettes cigars the nastiest sports equipment and sneakers motor do\nEven litter boxes and skunk spray or no match for owner ... dot com or called Jewish and eight hundred nine three zero nine to two seven\nNow get out there and they were\nLocal national international news traffic whether stocks in business news happening now read at your fingertips at news talk nine Ninety dot com and download our phone up to be completely covered anytime anywhere hiring\nTries dip recruiter unlike most jobs ... recruited finds candidates for you and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast zipper\nCruise the smartest way to you ... a time saver traffic sponsored by mothers against drunk driving slow driving along for twenty two from all walks into twenty three Seventy six ease delays for\nSeventy six to lead wouldn't spend the money to ride less than a gym pass them divine Foley's are open further West is little city out through Belmont\nStudy five sound bounce them guys delays McKenna me all the way down through Gerard fifty five slowed the\nFreeway forty to vote in countless jobs through two Ninety five delays coming off the Ben Franklin tend to center city onto the vine expressway center says the west trend line twenty minute delays because of the signal problem for victims of\nDrunk and drunk driving the grief is unique but you're not alone manager to help cover twenty four hour victim ... eight seven seven mad help for ms ... men died or that you may di di di ...

any of the only thing that are open seemingly the even though that's hosted says no\nComeback America on here that was Lindsey Graham talking to Sean Hannity last night about red state Democrats I'm joined now by Tim Alberta of Politico follow him on Twitter at\nTim Alberta Tim the polling support Lindsey Graham Heidi Heitkamp Joe mansion in deep trouble Joe Connelly wavering I Believe any Republican votes against judge Kavanaugh as toasters well what do you report\n[noise] but you know they might they might be post a regardless of how they vote on Kavanaugh Hugh or you know I'm not I don't want a cop out here I'm not I I don't know I don't know that that is going to be determinative hum\nLook I I think you have an incredibly favorable\nDynamic with this Senate map for Republicans to to hold onto the majority and potentially expand on their majority and and obviously on the house side of things are very different and republics to play defense and I think are still pretty likely lose the house so I I don't know that\nYou know what everybody is hair on fire about cabinet right now for understandable reasons um\nBut ... but I just don't know that that it's going to ultimately move the needle elect totally the way that folks are beginning to talk about it could but but I I think that we should just pump the brakes because as we've seen in the era of Trump or these things tend to burn hot and burn really fast\nTo Alberta now a low listen to me care plan this because I bought the audience to\nTo confirmed for you you can talk to them later I spent the first hour today like I did all of Monday talking only two women who were first time caller and we're pretty good at identifying scam artists and all that kind of stuff we've been doing this and like in\nTwo thousand Cathy in Scranton, Pennsylvania and in Dallas Sarah in Tampa and Detroit's got a teenage son normal also in Michigan Alexandria Newport Beach Elaine in Louisville Jeannie in Oregon Shelly in Columbus and in San Diego I can only be taking calls an hour that's the max nine out of ten of them are\nVery happy the president went after Dr Ford's testimony last night can out of ten of them one of them said no just we should all up at the other people cannot attend to them demanding cabinet or be confirmed and then senator urged came on\nAnd said based on the fear of flying issue not the committee didn't she didn't know the committee was coming to her\nThe ex boyfriend letter the second front door investigation the Rachel Mitchell Report she has a solid yes I'm cabinet ... unless the FBI corroborate stocked or for that is very different from yielding to Jerry ... you know black male about impeachment she's saying I'm a yes is that what you're hearing\nThat for you is what what I'm hearing\nRepublicans Republicans are standing strong every one I ever talked to they are saying ... percent corroborating evidence of Dr Ford in this report they're staying strong with cabin on\nYou know look I think that's the assumption I think that um you know Senate Republican leadership\nBelieves that that absent corroborating evidence that that that that he is going to be confirmed that they're going to have the votes um but I I think that there is sort of a a a an unspoken built in caviar in everyone's mind here that that um\nYou know corroborating\nEvidence is is potentially in the eye of the older you are and and I know that that sounds strange but we're living in a really strange time and this is a very strange situation and I do think that there is\nA potential for some finding that is not corroborating any legal sense but that is a you know a significant in undermining portions of of judge Kavanaugh's a sworn testimony and that that could change things for for\nSome senators for some Republicans I'm not saying that's going to happen but I I certainly don't think that anybody is closing off that possibility if they're being honest about\nYou know the audio and transcript a journey urge to be posted pretty soon but I'll tell you what struck me ten\nShe is not going for that little margin you tried to go there shooting which is you know drinking or throwing ice in a bar that just irrelevant or she wants corroborating evidence of the assault\nWhich launched all of this everything else is post facto to her and doesn't matter and I actually believe Republicans will be wiped out if they do not\nBurma cabinet shop with an ... in the absence of an explanation corroborating Dr Ford story I really think they will be wiped out in a way the ... vote will be selling math because what I hear and pick up is is just passion\nLike I haven't seen in two years you know Trump is as a shattered the Republican Party it's altogether that is what Lindsey said last night\n[laughter] yeah look I I I Would certainly agree with you there I I think that the Republican base is probably even more unified at this moment than it has been in a in the Twenty one months of the Trump presidency does far I I don't think there's any question and I and I do think that just as they\nShould do it as a matter of of sort of delivering and as a matter of motivating and mobilizing 'em yet politically yeah there's there's no question uh that that they are now in a position where and I think for folks on the hill even some folks on the Republican side who sort of whisper like geez I you know\nRobert cause he hosts Washington Week in review on friday night he who is a member of the Washington Post great repertory will pay my colleague MSNBC and NBC good morning Robert how are you thinking when you\nLet me begin by recapping for you the first Arab my show by all way\nExcept the calls from women who were first time caller and we're pretty good at this Bob

pan out of ten\nWant Brett Kavanaugh confirmed at are outraged nine out of ten believe that the president did the right thing\nAnd questioning her testimony last night I think I I saw the reaction that he was being criticized by the blue Bible people for mocking or I didn't think it was mark here I thought it was attacking her testimony but I think he knew what he was doing and it wasn't a raft\nWhat do you think\nAbout when the look on your show or whatnot ... weather plenty ... or ... or the ...\nOn her part on law because we always talk about the new one with a bomb the Nineteen Ninety eight years of the ... products circle the women independent voters are going to the alarm on the bottom of the nation brought up a whole lot of ... of member\nBut you're in ... in maybe ... ... women are energized the\nAnecdotal evidence is always evidence of anecdote says as a law professor I Know you can't go foreign anecdotal evidence but I'll tell you what let's play Lindsey Graham on it\nUnity last night cut number Fifteen\nWhat about these red state Democrats I think they're toast all of them all up all of them politically motivated by the only people that are open seemingly ... even though there tell us to say that I Know\nRobert Joni Ernst with just on she confirmed that they got polling and the honor and see the ... shows Donnelly mansion hide care McCaskill all falling and I think that's going to impact congressional races as well\nEight foot the choice would be like a Democrat he on like Donald Indiana declining supporting President Trump supporter pilots are worthy of in an RV and talking about the need for a border wall that he knows and go to Heidi Heitkamp another thought that they vote or off at all\nThey could ... they are out of balance the current political dynamic heat to get some voter independent voter who made like Bob and all like puzzle in central or not and go to them and the\n... year but they also have the ... in the rye laugh at the perfect storm for them and and not by Graham\nAnd senator and they have a point he let it go ... running a plug in some one\nOf them thought point\nI also like salient says often forgotten I learned that from a ...\nA Martin back in the day of Harvard that you always have to look at polling data and find out whether an issue how people respond an issue but how motivating it is I think the cabinet issue is I didn't have any parallel in my experience back the Clarence Thomas it's even more intense than that I was only a weekend house back when Clarence Thomas day\nThe intensity has set off and I think Robert it is because of the unfairness of it I and I got one of the woman called I got this a lot on Monday I have a teenage son I'm worried about my teenage son\nBut but it's just his daughters I really do think it's about parents of kids watching these daughters be tortured if you pick that up\nI mean you see this visceral raw across the country but you do see a lot of parents uh I've I've seen the anecdotally as well mothers and they worry about their son the father is all worried about their daughters mothers worried about their daughters what's happening is that the cultural divide\nIt beyond Cavanaugh I mean these gender debate or or in this country I mean you see it on line with talk about men right eating a rival commentators like Jordan the image or onto a
