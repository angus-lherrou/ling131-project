remember the first senator\nWho was a woman she was from Maine signal hill by Susan Collins she was the first to stand up to Joe McCarthy and the politics of personal destruction strike me as exact\nMcCarthyism except the charge here is assault and battery against women legit true against Harvey Weinstein Bill Cosby many others not true against Brett Kavanaugh\nJust don't have here no well the question is how do they know that it is I've done over the testimony because no evidence has been produced and I I haven't done it ...\nNo no there have been six investigations urban such fulfilled investigations are Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd six fulfilled investigation revealed nothing not even an allegation Dr Ford came forward and as the special counsel probe for narrative doesn't hold together it needs to be corroborated it's not persuasive and in the absence of evidence to make the allegation dispositive is McCarthyism\nAround I think frankly that Harrison that cruel relevant to me is that the parents and I thought about yesterday ... catch cannot survey on his career working around cats are\n... of President Bill Clinton and the question and that debate that\nOf the country attacking right now and the question fundamental I Am and all that the charge right under early on in the effort to air\nI'm not sure but you know Iraq debate about perjury in which case statements about drinking and micro rounding out or is it really mapping underlying hot issue that's been raised by Dr Ford and the others which as you point out I had\nBeen a subject of a color and ... and I took the FBI presumably working on right now are we talking about that and he produced are we talking about the underlying question that perhaps I Will go a issue or what happened that change your teenager so\nLet's focus on the first issue I I\nYou and I disagree I think it is a difficult at all unless we change the standard of due process but on the issue of line he did not lie he did not perjure him so he said he drank drank a lot he drank to the point of falling asleep\nAnd the people who are out there on the Web saying he purge themselves are themselves lying because he never said that and and do you have any testimony that has been contradicted by anything less far\n[noise] you can't really think that\nWere around thing and throwing a coverage when you read an article\nUh yes I Do yes I Do\nOn that and of course at the high school yearbook I grew up in the ninth inning why a bank there are facts garnished prayers and very importantly\nWell I agree I agree with that he got ...\nYeah it's not relevant or not the doctor or a\nBut it's certainly relevant that question the way in which black power knock the jacket on a Supreme Court presented himself too much\nThere is no way that his discussion back and forth about Ralph thing is perjury there just is no way that that is lying notices characterization it could well be true it is not lying and in fact he said there were many jokes about the fact that he would often throughout that just means you can't hold the beer\nThat just means you can hold enemy and it also occurs to among other things but that's not lying is not perjury and I think Susan fundamentally the reason you saw Heidi Heitkamp numbers woman and I don't know if you saw that poll yet she went from four points behind it ten points behind in one week thing four points at ten points in one week what does that tell you\nWell here we started out and I think it points to circle back to work right in the middle of the election my own view is that in America and that's not hacked which I guess it won't\nBe that different competing versions of what's happening to drink that this might be Iraq rallying\nParties increasingly distraught and upset a political base it and it would not at all surprised me a ... at that one of the cases were Heidi Heitkamp in a very solidly red state at the same time\nObviously he this as a currency actor for many women in British gauge concerned that the testimony of women is being hurt seriously and so I think you could actually ... ran it appears to either country and yet\nMotivate voters different parts of the country I mean different parties to come out and I I I see that\nHappening already but granted Mitch McConnell that with my final point I Want to make you know what he meant to the park changed

pay down Kavanaugh second he had them you know uh bring to the floor and live at three regardless I think I'm a you know what can the country in terms of what we found we don't know\nI I think you're right I think he's going to move it forward I think he's going to get Joe mansion ID I damp any and and I don't know about any other one being undecided except those five senators he'll get Jeff Flake but I Want to go back to one last comment\nA please be open to a third narrative inside the beltway right now it's the two Americas narrative there's a third America which doesn't much care about politics but they are fair in decent people and this has been indecent to the judge they know that Dianne Feinstein sat on it they know that it was leaked\nThey know that that ridiculous stories like the rape or on the boat off of Rhode Island that Sheldon Whitehouse retail than the media was wrong and has been recanted and will be prosecuted they got a meter that is about fundamental fairness and it's been implanted in since McCarthyism and the new Roy Jones\nSheldon Whitehouse and his gang I think Susan that that that we just got to be open inside the beltway to the idea\nNot just reds being redder and blues being blower but people in the middle of the purple our best\nWell you know I don't know about that they already have Congress pretty much which generally happen approval rating in a

ruled out that the lights might have burned out\nBecause for them on out simultaneously I thought it had to be a short in the system and that affects them as as you suggest that I'd change a ball but I said no no honey that can't be at that so yeah they all went out the same time they kept it and one of them control from the control didn't go out and so the ... you really had to change the light bulb and I said no that's not it\nSweetheart leave this technical stuff to me and uh she also bought a new battery which turned out to fix the I\nThe number whatever they call that Fox St ... came and the first thing he says oh let's just trouble shoot let's just change out the ball but just in case and sure enough the for bombs were burned out\nAnd he's very gracious he said you're troubled
