beaten by democratic activists over the weekend mob violence\nWe saw that Susan Collins needed the police to come to arouse because the mob said something we're not sure which I Know one senior government official who received a package that required the intervention security forces\nThe left in this country is unhinged and the left is represented in the Democratic party they are running the Democratic party they ran the attack on judge Kavanaugh and it is a ma meanwhile Lewis fairer caught I guess I got to St Louis Farrakhan Twitter won't even confront\nThe very on edge anti Semitism Louis Farrakhan won't even do it but at least Lindsey Graham is still speaking trade here's Lindsay on Fox who they are the last number five\nApparently one take up a meal without enough for a better

about alliance offending freedom of got mad sharp joining me\nHe's the senior counsel director of the center for legislative advocacy an alliance offending freedom\nGood morning Matt welcome to your your show every morning pardon me\nBut you know I've had that so many alliance defending freedom people over the years have been a longtime sponsor and always my friend and they're in the news today because Alison rushing Alison Jones rushing\nWas nominated for the fourth circuit hat or hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee and I read from the people for the American way a mat\nDuring last go Alison rushing chose a summer position at the alliance defending freedom man called the Alliance Defense fund better now India is one of the far right leaning organization opposing algae B. Q. equality church state separation abortion rights\nAnd the eleven years since she graduated law school she has continued to support the organization through its Blackstone legal fellowship which helped mentor in advance like minded lawyers I gotta tell ya I Love Allison rushing now more than I ever did\nWell we are uh you know pleased to see a great plate of judges overall being opened up there and I'm very excited and it's of any as well\nNo well tell me about did you ever work with Allison have you ever did you do you know or from your time as the legislative counsel now I Do not okay so I just want people to know\nThe Blackstone fellowship program is one of the great reasons alliance defending freedom exist they mentor young lawyers they help them get jobs they teach them up and originalism they help them with their careers they're everywhere but you're also on the hill Matt tell us what a ATF does on the hill\nLike there's a lot of work going on with a legislation the impacts religious liberty that impacts campus free speech in a variety of issues and we're\nConstantly consulted a without legal expertise that hates us at the Supreme Court in litigation across the country of what is the impact of these laws who are they going to help who are they going to hurt some bad laws up there and so we're asked to provide our legal guidance on these very important legislative issues with\nThat [laughter] so so how big is the center for legislative advocacy alliance defending freedom is quite vast they've got four thousand is the way that attorneys I've already mentioned the Blackstone fellows they've got their alumni throughout the country but this particular center is focused on statutes in drafting how big is it\nWill say there's a handful of us that were working at not only at the you know with policy groups and allies on the hill but\nAcross the country with state policy groups that are fighting or religious freedom fighting for free speech and over again with they're helping them insulting them on pieces of legislation and the legal impact on just against taking legal expertise and helping\nTo ensure that the law of supply with those legal\n... some of your key people Matt Bowman went into the government of course ah my friend Carey went into the government you know Greg's Scott went into the government and came out of the government or how you doing when the government wants your lawyers to go to work for him\n[laughter] well you know there is a strong group of people across the country many came out of our black them program that are passionate about adding a religious freedom that\nWe are blessed always have a strong ally of attorneys and others working with is joining us that our work and so I you know although we all wish well those other positions where we're always blessed to have a strong crop ready to jump in and take up the uh take up the battle with for religious freedom\nNow I'm at a time and not math omen that sharp I'm Sorry about that I kind of think that the Supreme Court is going to find a way to get to the establishment clause quickly and to finally bring some coherence I had dinner or when Sharon ski on the program earlier this week he's a man of the left is the dean of the Berkeley law school which is a left leaning place\nHe said he expected the new majority to articulate a rule that goes back to the original intention the public attention intention of the constitutional conventions ratifying the federal convention and they came out of Philadelphia\nWhich is we will not have one religion in the United states and we will not have overt financial support for religious institutions and everything else like crosses in graveyards that's just fine how are you as optimistic\nAs I'm dean Chevron ski as pessimistic because he's not happy with that but I sure am\nYeah I think the the crack in the existing establishment clause just put into starting to show that\nPop up in a variety of objects I think at some point the court is going to have to grapple with these issues and I think we're we're optimistic about the district instruction is that are on the court and uh they're jurisprudence on those issues and hopefully the correct some of the laws that have been\nI started into that establishment clause cases over the years\nMatter you getting worried about winning too much you won jak told to master piece of cake shopping one Lutheran schools you won a ... going back to Washington state a cheap Cochran got one point two million dollars I saw him a picture of him with David Cortland going up there to get his money from the city of Atlanta to get worried about winning too much\nWhenever I Do have to remember you know it's just a couple of weeks after jak one that the state of Colorado went after him again\nI said the price liberty at the title vigilant than I think it just demonstrates we can never sit back and just left on the Web but it's an ongoing battle because we know that it's like the Colorado that got their jak that all of these other situations got attacked religious freedom and\nFree speech and that's why we need alliance defending freedom matched sharp from the center for legislative advocacy it'll and serving freedom thank you let me give me the specifics America\nOver here at dot com there is an ATF banner kind of picture checked alternate means ... owns masterpiece cake shop and who have the courage the strength and prayers of millions of people to persevere to win\nBecause the alliance defending freedom walk alongside of him a and it says will you please defend religious freedom if you click on that\nCan make a donation online if you'd call eight six six seven hundred ten sixty eight six six seven hundred ten sixty it could also make a donation everywhere you go tax deductible whatever you give us tax deductible hundred bucks tax deductible\nBut it will become a two hundred dollar contribution you only get to the doctor honored you

the time making ... make it work\nHad over there we've had hundreds and hundreds of you respond thank you do you believe in religious freedom if you go to church you should be supporting alliance defending freedom because they're coming for you to\nThe left the mob left is not happy with faith based lifestyles and faith based messages and faith based speakers in public places they are not happy with um well we got a four circuit cage\nOr a bunch of the craziest from the extreme secularists want to take down a one hundred year old war memorial in the shape of across to an Infantry Division that were slaughtered\nIn a in the great war hundred years old been there for a hundred years and they won in the fourth circuit they won\nIt's unbelievable but that will go up to the Supreme Court maybe they'll probably figure out that crosses in graveyards do not have to come down I keep thinking about the American cemetery outside of Normandy that I was at a year ago with my friend Jay engineer up and just how moving it is\nAnd it's all stars of David ... crosses that did not see any Islamic crush since I'm ...

I think he's going to run really well there\nAre she's going to try and win by Karen in in St Louis and Kansas City very heavily that's typically the formula I don't think it's going to work here I think Josh is going to run well all over the state but you know we're not talking about uh ten point you know election probably\nBlow you off but it is it says ... year as city I've ever see I mean I I just it's it's hard to make for production is even two weeks out\nI'll be over and play our mid term madness the gym because I think it is I'm getting more and more comfortable with the Senate races knowing which way they'll break and I'm very encouraged by Jim John James soaring in Michigan oh close that gap but I'm pretty pretty comfortable about it now\nJurors I'm watching the New Jersey to\nOtherwise oh yeah man does this fall and because I mean that's really a heavy burden to be carrying in this year to of been prosecuted as she was and they're not money\nInto that too you know\nTo say I did their ... their panic special counsel Mueller is expected to issue findings on the core aspects of his Russia probe soon after the November midterms\nNow I have a I have a problem with this story being out there I have a problem with a leak either one exonerated the president or one uh blasting the president or this is not what justice should be doing it would be disastrous for justice if this report comes out before the election agree or disagree Jim Talent\nNow I agree uh it it would be disastrous to leak something of this if it's even on a lecture were not company do you I mean they ought to they need to hold and confidence until they can present the full report everybody can read it I don't think it's going to find anything I've never believed there was collusion with the Russians\nYou know they got in a port and some others with some unrelated things but I never thought there was glues you know I'm going to be shocked if they find it\nBut I and I expect the president be exonerated but I still think it would be banned from the bureau and the department if a leak that before the election it will it will be just like totally coming to the to the microphone about Hillary during twenty sixteen they gotta get these high profile investigations off a cycle of politics\nYeah here it would be bad your feet maybe they'd been compromised in the last couple of years I mean it's it was\nTerrible and I think Sessions' is is moving I'm not with regard to this country is recused himself but I think\nUh he is the director are trying to to clean up the top levels of the euro\nAnd the department to try and get politics out of there it's essential you're right this is a huge structural question and I don't mean by that downgraded I mean it's very or to people I have confidence in the integrity of the department and the bureau to operate non politically so you're right this would be this would be another huge problem along those lines\nYou know I Do not expect um attorney general sessions last much after the election I'm hoping Michael ... replaces him a mostly they have a comment on that but I Need your quick comment on my pond pale going to turkey and Saudi Arabia\nA big Clinton's comments he said I don't want to talk about the facts trying to make them look bad what he says I Want to talk about the fact they want to talk about the facts as we don't know what the facts are yet that's what he said and that's exactly what he should have said Jim Talent\nYes and we don't know what the facts are you know you've been reading and I've been reading that Danny but to have a good article today on the on the Web site actually from yesterday\nThat we don't know I mean yes there was there was clearly Saudi involvement in this we don't know what factions in the Saudi Government were responsible or and\nWe we need to continue to be able to work with Saudi Arabia in the region and that's\nThe things that the president and a A R R balancing and they certainly don't want to try and strike that balance till they know what happened so yeah we got to try and find out what happened then we got to try and do is sort of way where we stand up for what's right but we don't undermine our own interest in the region\nHow old is your high Canada\nTo you and I'm In Tampa today I made sixty the answer will be doing an event tonight if you want to come on out and joined us tickets available on the answer Tampa dot com\nIt's a dead heat and who is your land and I am joined by Mike Braun the Republican nominee for the United States Senate businessmen extraordinary has faced off against Joe Donnelly the incumbent Democrat who both elected Chuck Schumer\nIs leader and who voted for or against Brett ... to me Joe Donnelly voted against Brett Kavanaugh micron welcome to the program this new poll shows that eight\n... I'm Jay on the momentum that we've got the ah oh Kavanaugh episode has been measurable as I Know in that I didn't know was there a reason for all of that just came out that you are\nThe apple is being a star around the real clear politics that shows you and Joe and the margin of error and it shows the libertarian was seven percent that always makes me crazy\nWhen little yeah suicide these elections what are your city or libertarian friends out there about how important it is that they really care about freedom they got to vote for the guy who's going to support\nThe originalist judges not not Donnelly but Braun\nExactly and so much of a what libertarians believe in and Republicans that line up and I think\nThey just need to realize that uh if you really want your vote count bring it over to my side I live my life was alive read an enterprise that that I think as they you know start scratching their heads up through the uh under three weeks now there'll be I'm In my direction at\nThat real clear politics to average is Paul's I think to get that result that\nI can tell yours out there uh\nOnce we really pay attention to our own and we do um you know weekly through the finish line at a much better news than that of the Kavanaugh a episode when Donald late declared that he was going to vote against the judge or early on in that in and reaffirmed that\nUh we feel really good with a structural lead that we're going to be taking into these final three weeks that I it was unbelievable what a difference that made because I think folks really were white or in this particular race at a few others\nWhat does the differentiating factor and that was that you weaken talent from the moment almost became public on it at a\nGrassroots just across the board or disappointed with it\nWell it was it was a disaster for Donnelly because Indiana supported cabinet and they believed them\nAnd I know they are seen the average still has a man but I don't think they've got the cabinet bump in here and I think that bump across the country has been seven eight sometimes ten points Mike Braun because people woke up and said my gosh the future of the courts the future of our liberties backdoor libertarian friends\nOur First Amendment freedoms of speech and religion are are are right to be free of our property being taken without a compensation our Second Amendment right they're all on the ballot because judges are on the ballot\nWhile and on on those particular issues uh\nI'm I've got the endorsement of the n._r._a. all the pro life groups or the last debate he only a great deal of um ah one was about a week and a half ago\nClearly pointed that out if we go mostly by what our own information health is because we do it right at\nIn Indiana you've gotta you start methodology to get accuracy at all I can tell you is we feel we're in great shape or were carrying a structural lead that\nWere lost you there for a second Mike or you might be out in my ... year back\nI understand George W. Bush came into campaign for the president's for you you've got to the entire Republican ticket but again I go back to the libertarians [laughter] because they really we can't afford them to indulge the idea that uh their vote doesn't matter their vote matters a lot in Indiana\nIt it really does and I think when it comes down that rats there'll be making that calculation just like you've described it that I think we'll get possibly after three or four of those points because when people look into my\nRecord and what I've done there you're going to see a libertarian straight on that believes that uh the last ... we have the better off we are so uh I think that it became clear\nThat might gets a little bit more difficult time with Mike Braun candidate for Senate in Indiana and on my new audience in Al Gore and listen a closely in in South bend down south all the different places were on\nA lot of people still don't know your story so I just want them to hear your story how you came back from Harvard Business school and you built the business and you stayed Hoosier through to the end and now you're coming into politics they help us out of a mess\nYeah when my wife and I decided with tons of opportunity back in the late seventies and moved back to our home town\nWe did it because we wanted to have our own businesses a ban raise a family primarily blast with four kids three of them work in the business with me and that she started her own business and our downtown\nAs their only job it was forty years this temper so we've left the American dream and I that employs with me that at work for that higher scratch\nAnd and families that work army and things like taking on me a whole issue of the cost of health insurance back ... years ago it provided good insurance while covering preexisting conditions and no cap on average unless unless you out rainy up slap\nOr ten years everything Obamacare was intended to do but it's falling apart because that was big health care and big ... doomed to fail I've done something then the real world actually address that problem\nThat I Want to close by again going back to the fact that Joe Donnelly your opponent voted against Brett Kavanaugh this is a searing moment in American politics because it was so unfair Michael Avon audiences attacks are calling Brett Kavanaugh a gang rape is it was so unfair and Joe Donnelly\nSo for that and do you hear that much out on the\nOn the campaign trail you\nGet the dominating issue at here the other thing it did is exposed the ugly underbelly\nDemocratic politics you know whereas the massive or they want a salad or government that they're not willing to pay for\nAnd all they do is demonized heritage out at a lack of assay that showed up the Kavanaugh proceedings if people are relating at the Senate race because they let a gate at the same way\nBeyond the Twitter feed from Mike Braun is Braun B.
