Scott ladder attempted to talk about the special interests that are have\nFunded that Tom Wolfe thought that while tumbles wants to declare himself a you know free of those special interest talk about how he takes no gifts that they have a a gift band\nAnd or that he is just trying to do the people's business yet all the while he's predominantly funded by unions and trial lawyers and doing their bidding are folks who represent less than really you know a five percent of the population of the electorate a yet they control\nAre pretty much everything that Tom Wolfe does out without their approval he does not sign anything ah new ... all of the unions whose business plans are built on a bigger government more taxes more spending\nAnd so uh that that to me it was the elephant in the room that is always ignored unfortunately by the media and clearly you know traumatic had no clue yet these are the monies that are allowing Tom Wolfe to be spending over Fifteen million dollars and that's something else that just\nSort of infuriates me because he you know that the governor spoke about having camp but he called campaign finance ... limits on individuals and businesses and their involvement in the political process and and the debate over over these you know ideas and and priorities\nBut as we all know those limits on individual contributions don't apply to these special interests that are funding his campaign today so it's essentially he wants to have\nHe wants to have unilateral disarmament on the part of\nThe other side the party opposite yeah I mean there was so many opportunities of course to call it the hypocrisy of governor wall filing another area was a I'm a governor waltz V. telling\nOf a bill that would have helped to to deal with the opioid crisis instead or he ended up in heck workers that Iran is incorrect instead he did the bidding of the trial bar who has given him over a one man and a half million dollars\nA year and a and and a veto the legislation that was supported by the business community or by folks who recognize hey this could have\nA positive effect in fighting the opioid crisis and yet none of that again we came up in this debate yet these are the things that the voters should know that this governor who claims to not be a tool of any special interest has performed exactly like their pop it a while he's been in office so the political\nPressure I mean I think that you know as we said at the outset that because\nWhat we just experience was so obviously inadequate and that everybody recognizes it left right and center I'm you know even even the the adversarial media\nUm you know recognizes that that this is not it's not enough I mean ... will there be a political price that Governor wolf will pay for refusing to engage in any additional forums\nDoubtful I mean I I I just I'm I'm Sorry to be cynical um unfortunately or if this were but it was okay here here I'll be cynical or if this were a Republican incumbent governor and he refused to debate a and only agreed to one and it was a disaster like this I guarantee you are there would be an outcry from the media\nAre demanding that the government is drums write without a net ... fortunately I don't think we're going to see that um end of the people of Pennsylvania are not going to see the contrast that we could have otherwise saying\nWell I mean as ever ... people who listen to the show and thank you for listening or people who listen to our show have heard me saying many times\nRepresentative self government is not a spectator sport that you have to choose to be involved you have to choose to live life with your brain turned on you have to choose to seek out a sources of information that you can rely on and again the please don't take our word for it we thank you for being with us and listening to our show\nDoubt they're worried about these things know who you're lawmakers are um you know with their voting on

listening and will catch you next time on Capitol watch and now a town hall commentary from Lohmann Henry\nThank you David a favorite roam out of the left is tolerance tolerance to them of course is complete and total agreement with their view of America deviate from the talking points and tolerance ends usually with a series of tired old insults being hurled at anyone who dares to disagree\nThe left is at its most intolerant when the target of their venom fights back they seem to take it as a divine right well at least those who believe in a deity that their opinions and attacks are simply to be absorbed and accepted and that anyone who fights back as a barbarian at the gates\nThis unflattering trade of the left was on full display in the days after judge Brett Kavanaugh appeared before the U.S Senate Judiciary committee to defend his honor and reputation after having been ... by a series of unsubstantiated allegations which escalated and ridiculous as as each day passed\nKavanaugh came out of his corner of the ring fighting elite into those senators who for months at attacked him he challenged his accusers he defended his honor and the left was horrified he was denounced as an angry man who displayed in in judicious demeanor he was accused of politicizing the court and compromising his fairness\nJudge Kavanaugh had trans Greste against left wing orthodoxy by fighting back rather than me please submitting to the public lashing he was taking merely for having been selected for the job by president Donald Trump\nTrump himself has the poster boy for violating the laughs prohibition against fighting back\nDriving the laps visceral hatred of Donald Trump is unlike past Republican presidents he wasn't willing to sit quietly in the oval office and absorbed there blows quite to the contrary he immediately responds and compounds his violation of politically correct protocol by firing back\nI'm of course from the left and its mouth pieces in the mainstream media goes up how dare he attacked us as for the Supreme Court\nThe very thought the judge Kavanaugh has politicized the panel is laughable look at any given case and you can't predict with Ninety percent accuracy how each justice will rule\nThat especially is true of left wing justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg Elena Kagan's Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer\nIn fact you have any justice beers when their ideological lane it would be one of the justices more appropriately labeled the constitution was here in pens words the same left wing outrage is being felt in a race for governor Republican nominees Scott Wagner is a businessman with no interest in the long term career in politics\nHe is want plain spoken and couldn't care less about political correctness\nOr the boundaries on discourse set by the left\nAs a result he has pillage by governor Tom Wolfe and his allies who labeled extreme unhinged and everything short of a madman\nIt is true that Wagner himself as the Japanese should take some pills before speaking about his trumping an assault on the left is precisely the approach those working to secure pro growth policies must state\nWhat the left fears most is that the right has caught onto their tactic of intimidating those who disagree with them into silence or at best timid and watered down responses\nThat is why they have plunged the nation into the politics of personal destruction because they know they cannot win and intellectual debate and if they can't ... their opponents into silence then all that remains is to seek and destroy Americans however have an affinity for the underdog and for the fighter\nDeep down we are not the safe space nation the left believes in we're a nation of do worse of fighters of people who go out and accomplish great things\nThe fact that left goes into meltdown when we fight back is proof positive that we should demand our elected officials at all levels become more aggressive in challenging their policies after all there is much truth to the old saying\nThat all that is needed for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing\nWhen a down all commentary I'm Lohmann Henry if you miss hearing Lincoln radio journal on your

I think in the ... from mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just for ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThat the Republicans seem to show absolutely fairness or the accuser and giving deference to the wavering members in his own caucus delayed the confirmation one vote one week as the FBI additional in where he's\nAt midway guys with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice\nNow if in fact we get word that the FBI is done and that should all centers will have their report it's okay to file the notion of cloture because that's just thirty hours of debate people have plenty of time to read the report\nThat is right down to the Senate rules are there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cultural wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for senators to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nSenator I represented the victim of the sexual assault on a major college campus I Can't say more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to that comes because the institution that America has not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nThe fear of flying there and that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true\nBy her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she is familiar with polygraphs inconsistent with their testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal could not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that's\nVery rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there are problems with her testimony\nWell there are some ... well a ritual Mitchell uh\nWas retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um and I thought did a very professional job\nBut I thought she got the basic facts out demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have can brim relapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but I just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that the uncorroborated\nAllegations should be enough to condemn or a nominee\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry nabbed lower the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold each month proceedings I say bring those on cars they will be laughing stocks about Seventy rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh wide eyed said he absolutely did not lie about drinking did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a center\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous and I'm sure we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful in attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're all from this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts as five friend the majority leader likes to say uh after a continued to move a but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last night cutting number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats\nAll of them all up all of them\nPolitically anybody I Know the only thing that are open seemingly ... even though there is no senator\nCornyn a Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried a I think that uh I take the judicial I mean I'm sure I'm so I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are confirming what Lindsey just said\nOr has the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA duck Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as a base was confirmed\nThat you know I think things very big is going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of the McCarthyism directed at\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because if they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this at them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and uh this uh this ridiculous allegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or not display the appropriate temperament on the bench\nThis man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nUh there were a couple of times where I think well one time and in particular where he asked judge or senator corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut they shouldn't be expected just to take a business slander these allegations of\nCriminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and be justified and I'm a showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be obliged some good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for\nUm judge cabinet I I think it will be a huge mistake unless there is direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her career done as a Republican I've never seen the base this way is that the general sense in the ...\nWell I think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for uh for the judge\nIn the middle of this political debacle another letter blurred in it was from the president of the American bar association Robert Carlson says my sale it'll colleague Larry Elder members that letter that the\nPresident of the ab a sense urging the Senate Judiciary committee to hold off voting on\nJudge Kavanaugh until the FBI investigation litter with written by the president of the ... the name of Robert Carlson turns out Robert Carlson deny permission from the standing committee to send that letter and they're unhappy that he sent it without their permission and they're unhappy that people are suggesting that the ... has withdrawn its support of Brett Kavanaugh they have not\nFor negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst abusers of portrayed laws in on the planet what a quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump ... one of the points you made\nIs he said look I Want to use these tariffs as a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with the topic but what is it working 'cause these countries are reducing their cherished\nEven a review of the congressional budget office\nSays it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of top economists found Ninety six percent of greed or strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off close but with NAFTA than the previous trade deal so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI Do it you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped pass NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved this is the best of all worlds you know I my opinion we have a new free trade agreements now called the new apps M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer\nBut it is a new on North American trade agreement that will open up orders a between all three countries is modernized because America has a better deal and uh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage on other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about this do you also very it got me on that one I've not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics and this plan show I'm going to agree with you on\nThat one so on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for the candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just idling just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know we talked about this on your show before war and more what Americans producers called intellectual property we there's\nComputer software we Patton sent copyrights

destination\nMuch it's been taught about our celestial home many articles and books have been written and TV and movies portray a variety of ways\nI Hope you stay with us here has a Bible described a return or [noise]\nI Wonder why we don't say much about heaven [noise] maybe it's because we don't know much maybe it's because\nWe're not too excited about going there yet you remember the little quip about the little boy in Sunday school and his teacher asked how many of you want to go to heaven everybody to raise their hand except one little boy and she says Johnny what about you you don't want to go to heaven he said oh I thought you were getting up below to go now and I'm not\nQuite ready [noise] but I Want\nTo tell you something to do a lot of believers on though not ready\nTo go to heaven in fact they like it so well here they're not very interested in having somebody says well think about that one of these days but not now\nSo here's the whole purpose of this message they show you why you and I ought to be thinking about having preparing to go there somebody says I got to say that I'm prepared no\nNo that's the only part of the preparation is to have to do besides get say well you don't have to do anything to get in but that's not all the preparation we ought to be sharing an\nNot only with someone about the nature of the Senate God's forgiveness but the eternal home that God has provided for them we all know enough to talk intelligent about what happens is all about\nYou so I don't understand the book of revelation well the message I'm going to give you the day as you don't you don't even have to know the book of revelations\nThat knows some very important reasons you and I ought to be thinking about having talking about having\nHaving it on our mind and heart and sharing it with people who'd today are not doing their\nBosses you and I'll be thinking about having let me tell you the first reason first of all because our\nFather is there\nIt's interesting in the gospels\nThan in the summer on them out four times in chapters five six and seven Jesus addressing the people who are as much as he said the ... my father who is in heaven\nOur father who is in heaven the father who is in heaven four times he mentioned that sermon Eighteen times in the gospel of Matthew alone Jesus for first as a father who is in heaven\nAnd when he gave us the pattern prayer how did he began that prayer he said that this is the way you pray our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name why would Jesus say so often and refer to the father as being in heaven\nBecause that is our a colonel home that is our final resting place one of the reasons you and I'll be thinking about heaven talking about it and sharing is that's where our heavenly father is the second reason that's where our savior is\nYou recall what he said in the sixth chapter John when he was talking with the ... the ... and they were arguing with and listen to what he said he made it very clear where he came from he says the thirty first of all he says I have come down from heaven not to do my own robot the will of him who sent me he says I came down from heaven\nYou remember what the angels heads of the possible standing there when Jesus is sending he said why do you spend your gazing up in this guy\nThis same Jesus who you have seen as sin shell so come in like manner which means that he ascended visibly and physically he's coming back to visit and physically and\nThe Bible says he is that the fathers right hand in the last chapter do seem to follow those right hand and in Romans chapter eight thirty four he says he's their\nInterceding for you and me Jesus Christ saved up all those right hand is they're praying for you in the day and night watching over was answering our prayers theme to it that I Need some at\nMaybe think about this\nWhen you think about having the Lord Jesus Christ who stretched out his hands and his arms and was nailed to the cross for years and my son born in his body the penalty for all of our son and his chosen to live within us all the days of\nOur life and to walk with us answering our prayer and loving and giving us an cleansing us all the days of our life let me ask you a question don't you want to meet him personally there may be a lot of folks in heaven but I'm going to tell you there's not\nGoing to be anything like meeting him\nThere's the third reason you and all to be thinking about having that is the Bible says and John fourteen that the Lord Jesus Christ has gone home to prepare it for us he says he's going to repair place for us and if he prepares a place for us he's coming again to receive us onto himself that where he is that we may be also that is our\nFuture home is in heaven that is the Lord Jesus Christ he says he was going back to prepare plays president if you were to pass away the day you would not go to the head when he's preparing you would go in the presence of God but the final heaven it's where you are not going to spend eternity following the judgment state of Christ\nHe said I'm going to repair place for you and if I go and repair place for it he said in my father's house on many mansions many dwelling places he said that that we're not so I Would have told you I'm not going to tell you a lot\nSo he's telling us that they're drilling places places to live in heaven and he's going to prepare a place for us\nSo one of the reasons we ought to be interesting talking about it is that's where we're going to spend eternity with him and listen he's building your place\nBut those are both raised\nAnd that is that it's found in the Libyans chapter three that's where our citizenship is already\nHe says inverse Tony brown citizenship is in heaven but which also we eagerly wait for say the the Lord Jesus Christ\nWho will when he comes now\nTransform listen he will he will transform the body of a humble state that is the physical bodies of hours into listen in to conformity with the body of his goal right that is his glorified bodies our bodies are going to be transformed like his glorified body which will satisfy heaven\nYou won't be there so what are they going to think\nI Want to tell you not going to walk around and have an grieving over you at the judgment Jesus is going to wipe away all the ... and their eyes as they wait over the fact that you wouldn't trust Jesus as you say is it is only going to be one type of folks who go to heaven you say is that going to be all those good people know it's going to be centers\nWho to trust that in the shed blood of Jesus Christ of Cal ready for the forgiveness or their sand\nAnd who walked in his ways\nTo keep on being forgiven\nMaking mistakes falling and faltering and having to come back and say oh lord I blew it again\nBut being able to receive the forgiveness and got again and again and again if they have an isn't perfect folks heaven is for saints\nWho believers still learning still faltering still failing and still growing still being conform to his likeness and my friend heaven has been open to you\nAnd when you think about all the things that are there and listen if you miss having you know what you're gonna miss you're gonna miss and God you're gonna miss ... says you're going to miss the Holy Spirit not going to happen or awards\nYour name will be in the lamb's book of life because you say you've never allowed to one of the gods servants to inscribed in there\nYou're not going to be there for the great wonderful exciting eternal reunion with loved ones\nBut my friend the Bible says you're going to a dark\nEternal endless separation from everything that is good and because of your own self his choices you're going to live there [noise] and suffer evaporate turn it they\nWouldn't you agree that that's a foolish choice to make when there is another show us\nIf you want to ask the Lord Jesus Christ the forgive you have your fans and you're willing to repair those send you willing for God the turn you around change your life\nIf you're willing to tell him the day that I received Jesus Christ is my savior believing in meaning that you accept his death on the cross his payment if you're saying and you're feeding him into your life to be you're saving your life and your lord he writes your name and the lamb's book of life forever everything we just said you have the right to look forward to it\nBought about it\nBecause you honestly and truly tell me that it's wise to live a life of selfishness and independence of God and take your chances which really are no changes at all\nWhen the grace of God\nYou can have it All right now\nYou have eternal security right now and knowing your life\nWhen you get to heaven your wife your son's your

covering of Jesus Christ we have to admit that we cannot cover ourselves\nRemember that quote from James Montgomery boys he said the best works we can manufacture\nOr like monopoly money in the side of God he don't monopoly money has great value\nIn the game of monopoly but it has no value in the real world\nIf you don't believe that\nJust try taking a lot of monopoly money putting it in an envelope and sending it in for your next mortgage payment and see what the lender does with it\nIt's the same way with are getting worse and worse are valuable in this world\nWe think we can impress one another with are good and works look I've got more than you and he has more than him and so forth I mean we in press one another\nBut we don't impressed God in the real spiritual world are works had no value before were saved and they are sixty four six God says you're righteousness the best you can do is like a filthy rag\nAnd the side of God Adam and Eve had to admit and acknowledge their guilt the inadequacy of their own covering before they could receive that garment\nThat God's provided did you know that's the first death recorded in the Bible\nWhen God flu that animal\nAnd he took the skin of the animal and used it to cover Adam and Eve and of course that was a great foreshadowing\nWhat God would do one day on a hill called mount calvary\nOne he wouldn't send his son the lamb of God who takes away the center of the world to be the covering for our sins\nBut my point today is even though Adam and Eve had to do something to receive the forgiveness got offered God made the first step and reconciliation and he did the same thing with you and with me God took the first step and saving us\nIn Romans five six fall says for why we were still helpless at the right time Christ died for the ungodly\nOccasions to four and five but God being rich and mercy because of the great luck with what she loved it even when we were dead in our transgressions has made us all live together with Christ for by grace you have been saved\nFirst John for ten and this is love know that we love God first\nBut that he loved us and since his son to be the pro fishy Asian the satisfaction for our sins\nDan repentance remorse that is an important ingredient to receive forgiveness but not to grant forgiveness schedule see in the weeks ahead if you make brand new forgiveness depending on what that other person does or doesn't do you're going to become their prisoner for life\nForgiveness is something that we take the first step toward it something that we grant instead of waiting for the actions of the person who is wrong ... why is it that\nForgiving people Christians ought to be better for givers first of all forgiving people understand or guilt secondly they understand or need for intervention that is sometimes for giving people have to take the first step\nIs the third reason for giving people should be better for givers forgiving people understand grace during a\nSymposium on comparative religions and London a group of religious scholars from all over the world and gathered together to compare different religions and the\nDiscussion question that day is what is it that makes Christianity unique from other world religions\nAnd the people in the symposium throughout several possibilities the incarnation maybe the resurrection and yet when they were truthful they had to say there are other religions have shaves her versions of those stories as well\nAs they were having this debate among themselves when all of a sudden the Oxford scholars cs Lewis walked into the ring wanders the ruckus about space plane they were trying to determine what make Christianity unique from other religions he said oh that's easy\nIt's grace grace\nHas thought about it they realize Lewis was right every other religion says God's love is conditional you have to earn God's laws do this do this do this and God will love you or he will forgive you only Christianity makes God's forgiveness unconditional\nEvery other world religion can be summarized by two letters D O do this do this do this and God will forgive you Christianity is spelled D O N E done\nIt's based on what Christ has done for us what is grace here's some definition grace is giving people what they don't deserve\nI was talking to a woman not long ago her husband who was guilty of infidelity according to the biblical standard she had every right to divorce her mates for his ... but she chose to keep the marriage together to reconcile and work on building\nOf their marriage that husband was the recipient of grace\nReceiving some things he didn't deserve\nAnd of course the basis for extending grace to others is the grace of God has extended the U.S when he gave us\nYou know there is a great misunderstanding about God for giving us we had this idea that oh that's no big deal for God to forgive us if it means Dodgers chooses to overlook RCN just kind of like we overlook a smart alec comment from one of our kids\nNo a holy God and they listen to this a holy God cannot overlooks than I'd just God cannot allow send to go\nMarked down these references exodus Tony free verse seven\nKing far from a false charge and do not kill the innocent or the righteous for a high God will not equal I\nQuit the guilty not cannot just simply pronounced son unilateral unconditional not guilty\nHe can't do that a holy God can't do that now who won verse three says the lord has slowed angry great in power and the lord will by no means we've been guilty and punished and just God I Can't say well I Know you deserve that\nI Know you deserve health but I'm not going to punish for your sense he can't do that\nA holy God deserves that punishment must be meted out for than further is saying where is there a transgression there must be a punishment for the wages of sin is death you say well then how is any of us how would any of us ever be saved\nHere's how\nGod\nExtends us grace giving us but we don't deserve by giving somebody else the righteous what they don't deserve\nFucking Corinthians five Twenty one explains it this way God made him Jesus who knew know send to become send for us that we might become the righteousness of God\nAnd him say it has to be punished\nThey're great truth of the gospel is Chrysler willingly board the punishment that we deserve for our sand\nAnd in the past in second Corinthians five Twenty one there are two amazing exchanges that take place when we trust in crisis our savior transaction number one God gave Christ are sent in\nThat age and she's also sued the obligation for ours than when he died on the cross it's not that Jesus became a center that Jesus took responsibility for our send\nSome years ago Steven Spielberg I Believe it was had the movie the last ... and one of those things about a young emperor in China\nBeing ... brother approaches him and says\nWhen you use them for does wrong\nThe young ever said well when the emperor does wrong one of his servants suffers illustrate he took a base and smashed it on the floor\nAnd then ordered that one of his slaves Bebe Philip Yancey says\nGod the father the king of kings has reversed that formula that is one one of the king's servants does wrong\nIt's the Cain who suffers\nAnd that's exactly what happened when Christ died on the cross he took hours than\nHe took the punishment we deserve God made him who knew no San become sin for us\nBut there is this second transaction that takes place when we become a Christian God gave us Christ righteousness not only does he take my Senate and place it on Jesus Christ a choice and God in Christ righteousness\nPerfection and he credits us for that\nHe made him who knew do send to become sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God in the em\nAll explained that transaction another way and Romans for versus five he says but to the one who does not work ... believes in him who justifies the ungodly his faith reckoned as righteousness\nAnd everyday living and let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks

years why it is really the way the deck and waste a decade\nCan result in a waste of life if you want to write on your tombstone what\nFrom the point of view conversion to the\nThat would you have anything\nIt [noise] and if you\nIt would it be ... were writing picture from the federal service here on stage\nHere in the casket we've all come to say goodbye to you know we we are programs\nA program says John Doe or Jane Doe was born this year this month died this year this law was converted at this year this month burn\nConversion they're usually when\nTo date of birth and death\nWhen you were born dash when you died and let me just relocated to bash [noise] when you\nSaid that when you\nDash is all about\n\nWhen when did the issue is what did you do with the bash [noise] most of my concern about how long we live in\nFact the national concern of life when it comes to retiring is all about the dash fifty years if it was a waste it fits [noise] and if so why I'm telling\nYou it's going to see if they're not saying it in a ton of money in\nIf we can do that\nNot enough for you\nLet me give you a closing benefit here there's a lot of benefit of this\nWhen you are living out the expression of the spirit and your life for the ministry God has caused you to when you are living\nProblems you fall or problems don't become much problems\n[noise] she will come on I\nBecause we live in for the wrong thing for a living for the wrong thing and they are making help someone out there we are\n[noise] when\nThings go wrong things wouldn't have that much power over ... ...\n[noise] we live in for nothing\nWe have a space program in the United states and we have a space shuttle the space shuttle sits on a pad\nIt is ready to launch on its mission and sits there because gravity says you're not going to where\nYou stand right here until the countdown begins all of a sudden that\nTakes flight you know what [noise] the rockets boost fire escapes because energy is captured\nAnd launching takes place because of an engine is the night in\nHis fire if you're tired of being ground\nAnd your ordinary place [noise] sit in on that\nMay be a nice house\nMaybe a nice car\nOr maybe some money\nBut it's the same old pad [noise]\n[noise] and whenever the space shuttle is ready to go on this mission is lifting off from work\nAnd taking flight won't happen [noise] it's time to take flight [noise] if you're like me you have\nOf [noise] trust\nIf you found a fifty fifty [noise] ...\n\nIf you thought [noise]\n\nEvery man family three average lifespan\nYou than the average\nIs if you don't want to hear [noise] anyway\n\nSell the car going\n[noise] so the question is what are you going to do with the time is left [noise] if time to take off and lift off [noise] because you've been grounded too long [noise] if you've been convert [noise] my\nFulfill the mission God has thing to to fulfill\nBecause he's number to [noise] so here's what I Want you to do a project for you [noise] the Bible says [noise] three ... three scores scores\nTwenty [noise] twenty\nForty six three score\nThe seventies [noise] okay [noise] for\nReason of strikes he says\nFor school [noise] twenty forty sixty eighty [noise] so that's\nAnd not only men Seventy three women Seventy non that\nThere is going to fourth call if you want man [noise] pay for\nAge and the ducks at some Seventy three [noise] if you're a woman pick whatever age you are and the\nFrom Seventy not only do X number of years [noise] multiply\nIs three\nYou know how many on average\nDay you\nTo do it from\nIn the square and murder them censored is our\n\nAnd I just want to see him on average you\nScriptures that testify about me yet you refused to come to me to have life\nI mean if I might put it in terms of parks side what he's saying is you may have a big fat Bible and you may underlying it in at least three colors you may have symbols of diagrams and triangles in circles and\nAll kinds of mechanisms whereby when your Bible is around you're able to show how much the Bible means\nTo you but that Bible may never have brought you to faith in Jesus you may still refused to come to Jesus twelve life\nSunlight way but it is possible\nSo liquid Jesus s first forty\nI don't think I Will accuse you before the father your accuser is Moses most\n... what did they say in chapter night we are the disciples of Moses we know that God spoke demos it she says that are already told you about Moses it believes Moses you would believe me for he wrote about me but since you do not believe what he rode how are you going to believe what I say\nBecause you don't believe in the Bible if you believe the Bible you would come to me oh you\nTalk about the Bible and you say the Bible is very important and you strap parts of the Bible to yourself as you walk around and let everybody know\n\nWe see what these individuals were saying was something like this [noise]\nWhoever does not by ... this is really what he's doing they're doing it seemed to intimidate this young man who knows clearly that he was one blind but now we can see but they're giving them a bad time to back at him again and again and again seeking to intimidate him and Robin ... of the reality of what he's convicted I Wonder is saying is that whoever does not ... and our knowledge\nKnows nothing and whoever knows something we don't know is a fool\nWhoever doesn't allow to us and our knowledge doesn't know what they're talking about and whoever comes in here to tell us something that we don't know the ...\nThat's not only they approach of religious formulas and there's also the approach of narcissism and skepticism and intellectual elite as a dozen\nIsn't that what the Young University student what is what the what the tenth grader is up against it within the within the public square\nIf we'd be bold enough in a context that is allowable and understandable to say I once was blind but now I see I've discovered that Jesus is the creator of the end of the earth and died up on the cross and the death of Jesus as a pivotal event of human history and that everything needs to be understood in light of that\nOff please sit down with you unless you're allowed to what\nWe know you know nothing and if you think you know something that we don't know\nSit down\nWhile I Believe that God created the heavens and they're out of nothing and I would have chaos sit down\nIdiots\nYou exist as a result of time plus nicer plus Chan is borrowed to what we know\n\nThe religious formulas and one of these challenged by the radical claims of Jesus\nReacts in the same way or you say what what about well let me just say they're still your some of you may be here and there's actually described you\nSay well I Hope not but but let's just hold out the possibility shower you may be here and you actually are religious formulas that's been your whole background farms and structures and the doing of things do you have peace with God\nDo you have the assurance of the forgiveness of your sins\nDo you read and the reality of your hope that one day you will see Jesus and they made like him\nI wager that you don't you actually can't because of the religious form a list\nIs relying on their capacity to continue maintaining the external without the radical internal transformation which gives significance to the farm and structures of religious life\n\nIndeed there's very farms in structures may prove to be a barrier to you're coming to faith and Jesus\nSpeakers if you have a little list of whatever it is that makes you acceptable to garden it's easy for us to come up with this list while I always go by the golden rule than do unto others as you would do to yourself\nAnd that's my cradle and that's my good well\nThat's fine but what about your jealous hard what about your dirty mind what about your dishonesty how does this little golden rule and deal with these things\nOf course it doesn't say of religious formulas\nAnd was enough to get a man or woman to heaven and there will be no need for Jesus or die up on the cross with her\nDoing it ourselves it's sufficient than there would be no need for this amazing grace\nHow are we just got a moment to go to the word fear don't be afraid that we're going to go much beyond our time we're not\nHas not the fear that I'm referencing the fear here\nIs the fear that is found in the reaction of the ...\n[noise]\nThe Jews send for\nThe parents\nThey still didn't believe verse Eighteen that he'd been blinded received aside until they sent the man's parents after they send for the man's parents there was nowhere for them to hide\nAnd they brought the parents there to be a little intimidating for them I think you would agree if somebody something new to the synagogue other day and they are The Elders sat and the roads and then they're finally came along Mr Mrs Levi or whoever you are\nAnd they said thank you for coming out we're hoping for a chance to talk with you we have three questions number one the fellow over here to see your son number two is he the one you said was born blind and number three how is it that he can now see\nI was one looks at the wife and wife looks at the husband and then the wife response\nBecause she's the bravery of the two [noise]\nOr we can I say one or two very easily is our son and yes he was born blind but when it comes to your third question well are we really don't have a comment or not a tall\nThat represent their timid and they're quick to pass the buck why don't you ask him he's glad he can speak for himself\n\nClearly they must have known something they knew that a person was involved otherwise they couldn't have mentioned the person\n\nCan it be that they were more concerned for their reputation and for their status than they were thrilled and excited that their son had received a site\nI mean why why are they not linking arms with this boy and saying to these religious leaders this is the kind of thing we need in our church\nI mean we need some of the stuff guys we're listening to your sermons and frankly they're like the dust in your mouth and now comes the Galileo and profit\nHis sermons are understandable and look what's happening to people's lives yes we know Jesus is the key to this part boys here and we're here and what do you have to save for yourselves\nBut they don't\nWant to just ask him he's there and he can speak for himself he's a big laugh now admittedly\nThe prospect of being removed from the synagogue which is the explanation invest trendy to the reason the parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews because the Jews have decided that anyone who acknowledge that Jesus was the messiah would they put out of the synagogue\nWe're not going to make little of that\nThere's some significant Senate doesn't do the embarrassment that would be attached to that kind of removal\nBut if they had truly understood what had happened if they are truly come to understand who this Jesus was and then they would have taken their stand with a boy but as it was they didn't take their stand with the boy because they couldn't take their stand with the boy presumably because they have not come to trust and Jesus\n\nSo the fantasies are distanced from the great good news by their formal ism and the parents are distance from this great good news by their fear now\nLess this sounds so far away from it let me finish by contemporaries in the story for us 'cause this is not an uncommon story I've seen this happen again and

I mean do you like as to the book I mean do you like after the person that some of the of course you know the rest of the story\nAnd uh maybe you think well\nWe know that you like them\nBecause you've obviously the way you talked about so far\nYou always have taken a bit of a offensive to her and uh we know that you enjoy telling the story when I saw that me it's about you have you come to any conclusion about Esther supposing you haven't heard the rest of the story okay\nWell do you even know about Esther\nI'll tell you oh really we've been told about just so far we've been told\nI Try to find the text here that she was young she had a beautiful figure how she was lovely to look at well that's really always been tools although it is a ... and let's face it that kind of superficial\nObjectify women which that versus I've just read to you represents is the way in which over and over again in our society we come to a\nConclusion about people at least men come to a conclusion about women on the basis of that kind of information don't say\nWe come to conclusion about actresses ... actress I I really have no experience well just like to be a woman looking at an act tore up my only experience so far has been a lot of men looking at a press is okay but partly some tours appear to be hunks\nThat's the word I started Jews and certainly actress\nIs going to be attractive and we evaluate we think because they they must be really nice pseudo science always really really a nice parts to fly because we've seen them\nWhere does it look like we think we know them well actually we don't know Esther yet in the unfolding of our narrative\nFor the sake of those are new to the story all we know that that's just so far is is\nThat the king of Prussia which was the global power of the day but an empire that went from India to Ethiopia the king of Prussia the emperor Tasha is not a very nice person\nIn the opening credits of the story we discovered that he's very wealthy is enormous power he has a lot of lives including a chief wife known as the queen and in order to get the applause\nIt was an recognition of his core tears and his subjects he was perfectly prepared to humiliate his wife in front of them\nAll and when she stood up to him and said no\nHe got rid of her and uh that isn't very impressive\nIn the eyes of his people so he's very nice person\nIn chapter two we find that he is getting a bit bored and his people come up with a plan what they need to do is they need to find him another queens so they go out and they paired together for a hundred young women well the qualification was they had to be young\nThey had to be good to look at Esther actually had three things in our favor but they were looking for too but they found all these girls they heard them together for a hundred of them and they effectively kidnap them they take them away from their homes\nAnd they bring them to the royal palace where they live in a hurry and eventually they get to spend the night with the gang\nThat's the story it's not a very for the story so far I accepted Esther\nHas become the chief wife she is now is the queen of Persia that's where we left the story except for one very crucial thing for him when we come to chapter for this is in the narrative of the story the turning point\nThe whole book\nYou can see that sort of superficial kind of way up to know as far as being a very passive figure she has been captured she's being taken she's been subjected to all the beauty treatments\nThat you can get with for a whole year she spent her night with the kings she is now the queen everything has been happening to Esther and Esther has not being doing anything she's being passes\nIn the story so far even her cousin who had cared for her and really brought her up after the death of her parents her cousin has been giving her instructions and encourage ones and she's being subordinate to him and obeying\nHim about what's this chapter all of that changes from this chapter she herself becomes the primary and central character of this story\nGlenn stone to the very end of the chapter you'll find that even our cousin her cousins relationship to her changes because of the end of the ... through says\nMartin guy then went away and did everything Esther\nHow door to him\nSo this is a change for this woman this this woman is she is now she was a young girl probably no teams when she was kidnapped and brought into the ... something years of relapse and this woman's time has come", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Philadelphia", "day": "07"}
