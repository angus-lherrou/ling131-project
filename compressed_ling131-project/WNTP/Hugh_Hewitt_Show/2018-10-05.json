I think this is a\nA a an amazing thing he should be confirmed by the he will be confirmed\nA I think it's falling into place but this whole episode I think is an amazing and revealing moment in our history that is a drawing us back to a much larger debate about the nature of our country\nAnd behind that uh the ... the history and the standing of his western concept of the rule of law and I think this is a key moment that is now risen beyond Kavanaugh he's become a movement in a way about this representation of this idea\nAnd this has been engaged and um\nAnd so let me let me give you the background met your calling in the middle of a while to show I have spoken to Meredith in Los Angeles Lucy in New York county in San Antonio Debbie in Dallas Margaret and Hawaii Iranian Saratoga Jenna in debt and Kevin Illinois a truck driver my\nSeven kids a widow Cindy in San Antonio paralegal two boys Jan and St Petersburg Melissa in Dallas Beth and Michigan ... soldiers son deployed now Kelly in Virginia former sex crimes prosecutor\nKevin Columbus Sally in LA pan and Delaware a psychiatrist her name Pittsburgh penny in Virginia and Melissa and Winchester Michelle and the great but Texas Myron palace British\nCount Carol in Wisconsin Helen in Philadelphia Marlin tip 'em or listen to try calling in Pittsburgh they all want Brett Kavanaugh confirmed most of them are furious at his treatment and they have not been represented in the media\n[noise] no I think that's right I mean to which I was going to add ... you know my my my sister in law down in Fredericksburg people I've talked to is this is an amazing thing and I think that uh you know the the the initial push of this and raising it the way it was the last minute strike\nBut then it's gotten to the point where there's now a a pushback from that is more and more people have got involved and are thinking about this as um\nAs parents as siblings I'm as moms of sons ah it's just it's just an amazing moment when people realize that that that's what I met in the sense that this oddly where I Know that pose this way people are seeing that and it very clear in stark way\nBut this really is a moment in which a principal a core fundamental principle has become exposed in a way that the demands a fundamental reaction and that is a point about fairness I I was in a cab the other day coming in from Virginia and\nI got and I like to talk to my cabbies and I did not expect this conversation to go to the right way I was just chit chatting having all came on the radio\nHe asked me what I thought about it well what do you think about it and he and he looked at me straight that this is unfair this mad as being mistreated and it's on fair I think there's a natural way which which uh other human beings\nGet this which does go to the root of what it means to be a self governing country and establishment of the rule of law rather than the rule arbitrary men and about something that's called due process a process to which we are do according to the law because we're all created equal\nAnd we have an opportunity to be innocent before we are proven guilty goes to the heart of\nAll those things and you're seeing that reaction in common ordinary solid American people\nThere is a story today and the wall Street Journal that a friend of Dr Ford felt pressure to revisit her statement ah one that would indicate\nManipulation of witnesses there is on and he's twenty six color is a fundamental distrust of Dr Ford's um appearance not her testimony non her\nBut that this was manipulative process uh what do you do hear the same thing [noise]\nI I I think I'm a part of this is is is I think the American people\nAre a good compassionate people and they're trying to grapple with this question they don't want to they don't want to question ah her they don't want to question her um\nAh her passion and and that moment uh I think a lot of them see her as a victim as well she she well might have been been the I'm a victim of of harsh treatment or many cases are ...\n... is that there's there's no evidence here so how do you weigh these things and and I think ... their reaction is is that you know as more and more comes out there's manipulation going on here it seems that her own counsel does not share information with her the story itself is really falling apart I'm\n... and I think this is a a reaction to that are about ... and then people are saying well what if this was my son what if this was my brother but if you know um\nThere's so much we we that has been put out there in the last minute and the eleventh hour and and now it's like people just kind of throwing up on the wall and see if it sticks\nUm this is precisely why we have the rule of law so that this is not what rules us\nAh we want qualified good judges um you know the we we were going to talk ... we mentioned the other day this this letter with all these ... signed on he does not have the temperament regardless of\nUh all the the what you think about all the particulars he doesn't have the temperament and they make no mention of the constitution that letter isn't that interesting\nWell there about what it was that\nThat's a whole subject maybe I'll do that the academy is revealed itself the media has revealed itself many institutions of elite you know the Yale faculty the the the alumni of Holton arms they have all rushed\nTo convict judge Kavanaugh in a way inconsistent\nWith our norms and indeed I think the Senate will confirm him\nBecause they actually in the blue bubble doesn't include senators I think that they got out of the blue bottle I think they've heard from people\nI I I think they have I have two things have been revealed one is I think that uh that people have broken through incentives of heard them I'm actually encourage because we're seeing senators who here too for I I\nHad my doubts about but they they they are being political and and the good sense
