more than Missouri is incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill wants to hang on to her seat against her very able challenger Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley my colleague Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project merit tossed\nAside keeps investigative team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign\nWe've got the news because Claire McCaskill charged responded to our hidden camera investigation she attacked a video of course\nShe made a false statement in this state and she put out a she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Paul II\nHad brought you normally embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct I had nothing to do with Josh all that never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved in this investigation\nAnd just for your listeners know our investigation Claire McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her and McCaskill on Obama's policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that uh other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles\nAnd mechanical herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her saying that there would be a gun than the sum type so McCaskill's now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only the the Stanford talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talk about hand guns Clara herself talks about um when she gets into the Senate will vote with this so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there's the red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not ... they're they're they're moderate\nTo pro life pro gun Democrats external thing in Missouri do than these like state so whether it's an aspiration exposures that in order to get elected\nIn order to get elected you have to lie to people and that's what they are open staffers are saying he's saying the moderates we'll just have to get over being allied can very devastating very powerful I mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because it involves a sitting\nUS Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling her a wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill response teams okay\nWell it is some startling and Josh how I Would be part as fraudulent lean in betting on me and my campaign\nNice the attorney general of the famous Harry he's supposed to be going after fried\nNot participating in it [laughter] so um there was nothing there I Am very proud of my positions I made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment really telling about that\nIs how far they're willing to go to watch only in my campaign\n[noise] well first of all it does it mean both the fly categorically in on a clip of falls\nJosh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I've never met him and she didn't live on local TV in Missouri Larry what's gonna happen next to this this other Senate candidate John always say that he had\nNothing to do with it chicken after respond to that so I think we're or cheating our goal of holding people accountable band I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nHurricane that ravaged the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly unpredictable toll is now past thirty Kendall air force base near Panama City took a serious and it's one of the size of our elite twenty two fighter jets which anyone concerned with our nation's fighting ability ought to be concerned about that\nI turn to a regular on my program Congressman Mike Gallagher of the house armed services committees are defence expert at a Marine Corps intelligence veteran himself\nWith get right down to it the danger zone has receded according to I'm reading a real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will hurt Andy Barr Mike Bost Rodney Davis Brian Mast John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory\nIt if we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and very sound pretty optimistic it on hold the house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party ... as we have around my district an artificial Scott than we've seen in a surge in\nVolunteers coming in people coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful to pick up signs and ask\nWhat can I Do to help so I Do sense tastes light momentum shift I always thought this was going to be a nice that when we talk about control the house you know five seats one way or the other ... but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats for Democrats in Minnesota and that the Democrats are pulling out\nOf a couple of states that look if you try to get our direction so again we got to run through that you have this is you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't say anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down the candidate quality and sort of the twenty to thirty states that we are talking about here\n[laughter] so I don't let me talk to you about some defense issues first of all the twenty twos at ten dull a it's a murky picture or I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt that bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe a danger to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment and why by the way do we keep as twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell you try to read through this and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask\nHard questions of the D O D D bigger out what exactly happened it seems like Seventeen twenty twos or damage I think ten of those are cats and the storm right in hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds and seven of the center of the Seventeen were lesser rated hangers\nI think it's important to note that no one thought this would be a four to five little imported our prior I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here um but the planes are based at and do so that they can have access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want a bunch of ... going into super cruise over Kansas is too disturbing to the local community\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country so as best I can tell him talking to officials talking to experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired\nBut the problem here is the skin on the plane there's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive\nAnd my understanding of the initial site survey suggest that the air frame appear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back on track but repairing the skins um will be a very expensive proposition finally I just say one of your question you know why we're so many their ground\nThis goes back really to the Obama administration decision to halt the program a two thousand nine factory gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on the air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground and the first place\nWith their engines pulled it because of the lack\nOf spare parts and a lack of trained people\nTo repair that President enjoying were the job camping when candidates in vulnerable critical house and Senate races in Ohio he took time to praise the work of some of America's political and military heroes who hail from the state\nSolicitor civil war general Ulysses Grant was preceded by the mention of grants number one\nBlurry older shows are medium as users soundbites to paint Trump is a

leite was general\nRobert Daly was a great general change that [noise]\nAnd [noise] have rambling can develop a phobia\nHe couldn't be Robert ... he was going crazy I don't know if you know this other property lead was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln gamma reason I Can't really\nAnd one day it was really bad and you just said\nYou hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem\nAnd gives that I don't care what probably as you guys aren't winning [noise]\nAnd his name was grant general [noise]\nAnd\nHe went in and he not smell out of everyone [noise]\nResorted\nTo win grant really did he had a serious problem in Syria is going to give the man was he a good general and he's finally being recognized as a great job but\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence\nTurkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of move from inside the conflict showing who did what in the ... you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence ... who often work very closely with the Turks\nAnd then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on us\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared\nReally All right now doesn't impact that for example the war in Yemen this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses who's a Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to confront the who the ... or sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome a as being a necessary for the correction the middle east\nOr I'm not sure they had any impact on the Iranian odds I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt\nShowing any squeamish than his whatsoever about what's been done here and so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begun to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as the succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it as an exotic story and read like a trailer I'm Jamal ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long David Kirkpatrick\nYeah I think they're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is with elite opinion you know look at Wall Street and Silicon Valley or he's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and there are no out to help diversify the Saudi economy\nHe's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues in terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nListen to the entire interview with

I didn't I didn't quite understand that but we filed a lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is\nA is that we argue that the policy they actually required prior permission so they told the

unconstitutional he's only five permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us\nI'm so that the judge ruled that pay the cheap and now we're going to trial to figure out where

hurricanes going back to the you know as far as records are and whether that\nWas Tony I I've seen it personally first hand and by the way this week I've had people staying with me that have left the panhandle of Florida because of damage to their homes and the cause of no no electricity\nYour high and dry and late one Florida where your base and it's a little bit of a drive for them but I'm sure that they were out of there are very happy to be out of the path of hurricane Michael\n[noise] yeah it was great to have them here you know it's it's great to have how people in time and they [noise] so\nThe history of hurricanes you know we're always most worried about the most recent but I mean there's been other devastation going back many years\n... let's go back to the Galveston hurricane and Nineteen hundred that that hurricane a struck in Nineteen hundred and it was eight thousand deaths from that one hurricane\nWhy gunman believable taxes certainly experiences some extreme weather at times but the thought of that is amazing hopefully we learn a little bit from each hurricane Florida had a a terrible one though in a white gone way by\nA certain idea that we call it the ... hurricane of Nineteen twenty eight and came across from West Palm beach\nWhen inland it got a lake Okeechobee it was so strong it created a huge tidal wave across the lake and that killed one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people and that's when they decided to build a dyke around Lake Okeechobee show that that will never happen again and that\nWas at a time there weren't many people in Florida Nineteen twenty eight now it would be a much worse but as you said the Army Corps of engineers you did something to help out a little bit uh I\nKnow really interesting back was the New England hurricane of Eighteen thirty eight and one of the hot wind gust ever recorded and it was a hundred and eighty three miles an hour\nAnd so that that's phenomena that was that strong ... when it hit that in New England the a and then looking at a when I when I was a kid growing up in Florida we had to hurricane Donald\nYou came in the in the southern part of Florida came up to the states and uh that was Nineteen sixty Donna that went to the middle of the state of Florida came back out on the Atlantic ocean regrouped hit the Carolinas again and then what happened here in New England and when all the way and demanding as hurricane\nThat was in Nineteen sixty one of the longest lasting hurricanes we look at the miles traveled hurricane strength\nThen of course one that's near and dear to my heart and I know you were there shortly afterwards when talking a bit about it was hurricane Hugo Nineteen eighty nine\nAnd a that was interesting goes off while I'm On a plane I can remember flying there not after\nSeeing so many trees piled up along the road 'cause you just had to push it off the road to get the roads open and they were starting to burn it and that bond fires you know every every quarter mile down the road and that was the first time they had Doppler radar and it really realize that in major hurricanes category three on up three four and five hurricanes\nThey actually produce many tornadoes there was about a hundred and eighty something those recorded by Doppler radar\nOr from hurricane Hugo those only last sixty two hundred and twenty seconds that's when you see damage on one block you go we're kind of looked at the next by what happened there were touched down lasts less than two minutes ... they were gone you know\nWhere to get back to talking a little bit more about Hugo later because I was one of the ones that are devastated a\nAn area that had such a heavily concentrated number of golf courses in that area so we'll get back and talk about that a little more um foreign other real oddity was a little bit earlier in the ... century where you had a number of them come across the state of Florida one after the other after the other\nThat was two thousand and four and that was that there is Frances ... Jean and I'm\nCharlie Charlie Charlie France's and Jane they all cost in real estate in the county where I live\nAnd boy they major destruction we're out there fixing the damage on the golf course and

with hurricanes and their impact on the golf industry and the economy of the industry\nRun gave us a nice [noise] background on\nHer case for the last hundred and Twenty years in America now it's time to talk about three in particular that were so devastating in terms of destruction and\nThe terms of destruction the golf courses run a I Know we've all had experience with them but let's start with hurricanes Hugo Nineteen eighty nine\nNineteen eighty nine totally take a take a step to the side uh oh hurricanes come across the Atlantic ocean from the east to the west they followed the trade winds they've followed the cars all major oceans in the world if you look at him on a map\nThey blow caught laws so the weather comes off of Africa it comes across the Atlantic ocean it gets ... then the question is does it keep going west as it kinda going North West as it turned more north the ones that turn north [noise] have\nA tendency to hit the Carolinas all the way from the Carolinas up to Virginia and that's exactly what you wrote in Nineteen eighty nine and it was a category five hurricane when it hit in Charleston South Carolina\nNow are either hurricane hit at the Iowa palms just a few miles north of Charleston are never forget going there right after people are allowed to go back there that was the site of\nWild dunes Tom ... first top one hundred golf course and I walked on the ... with Tom and saw the devastation it looked like after the atomic bomb hit Nagasaki a and\nNot only was it devastated but Tom was devastated uh moved to tears when he saw not one single stick of anything standing on the island and ah [noise] I Know you could empathize with that\nYes I had of course it was just south of Charleston custodial ferry on the other costs to walk away than what we talked to blow also by the way because I was flying up there often to work on the golf course actually left a car at Charleston executive ... or ... which is out on Long Island\nThere and when the hurricane at first that dogs go hit Daytona then they said Jacksonville ... then they said it kept moving into Georgia South Carolina and I had I had a car they're outside so I called the FBI or rock up the car rocky want land my private airplane\n... can you put my car inside it was a Mercedes sports car as hell for fifty and so they said now that can put it probably gotten around her not that it was too late for me to go up there and get a driving back\nSo the hurricane went right over it I was up there two and a half three weeks later and the only thing that was their last\n... had blown down the entire hangers ever completely gone nothing but concrete slabs people at the last minute got smart and through their planes on other than that my car outside it every\nSquare footage that Congress beat out from stuff flying around you've never seen that car so beat up so uh the golf courses were built up also I mean the trees from the window of a category five hurricane interested enough hurricanes don't hurt grass\n[noise] you've got good drainage mirror you're good to go after the hurricane\nBut the tree removal is devastating it takes many many men are document and trying to walks on offer right after hurricane Hugo you can you walk down to find a way you had to dodge and we go under big ones calm over other ones around I mean it was a real chore to walk one train away\nAs you go the ... then went northwest all the way up the Charlotte North Carolina with massive flooding in his wake all the way there and golf courses were under water for a long time I'm Glad I certainly have\n... that was two fold\nHurricane and the next one Hurricane Andrew Nineteen Ninety two was much more of a wind currents\n[noise] but I don't want to understate of because it was the most devastating when the currents ever\nFisher thing about Hurricane Andrew was was the hurricane\nWinds did not go far out from the but because it was such a small hurricane give us time it wound and Andrew has some of the strongest winds ever and it went across the state from just south of Miami or came in a house that all the way across the do the average wage fortunately and\nThen it came out that Naples, Florida and I had the the ... club there\nAnd it just devastated the trees and the community there we're\nHerman came up the coast\nAnd then when it looked like who's gonna wipe out long ...\nTook a ride and turned and went inland and then straight\nNorth on I Seventy five in wrong girl unfortunately it came right free over again\nThat the parents were then about\nA Fifteen miles from my house to the to the to the west which means we're on the east side of the north east side and that's the wrong side of the many hurricanes\nAnd that's in Lakeland that's an electoral ... in the middle of the states but but we were blessed because we're going to have any damage to the house but we are trees down the airport was closed all the things that it takes just time to fix but fortunately no loss alive [noise]\nTwo thousand Eighteen a different story started with Hurricane Florence came into\nThe northern Myrtle Beach area and then north of that up into Wilmington North Carolina flooding beyond belief and all the way inland\nStill dealing with those problems in that area um the loss of income will be absolutely catastrophic in that area of golf courses underwater for months at a time in some of those areas there are no effect in\nFlorida but then the rapid punch of hurricane Michael came in at Kmart almost no warning and once again the advance tore cast was that storm surge from\nHurricane Michael might bring up to twelve fourteen foot storm surge right in the long boat she\nHad a we we saw waves we've never seen before um but luckily you know between the tides um it didn't really do any damage on I did feel running on the seventies fall on a night on on a day's time which was kind of surprising we actually had water coming from the bank over their car pass\nA sharp on a day and then can I receive back again when we talk about there\n[noise]\nYeah I guess uh I don't know whether the long ago the isn't one of the a sheltered areas or it's just a miraculous but\nHistory of this stretch from Sarasota up through Clearwater and maybe slightly even north of that for some reason Tampa Bay seems to have some effect on the path of these hurricanes and they're really have not been any terrible ones here when\nYou put first took the job here Terry ten years ago coming down from New England a as a except for having to leave your beloved New England patriots behind a ... you came to an area that with you know great excitement that a lot of your friends warned you\nYeah I was told you know you know everyone's gonna miss me but at the same time you know ...\nAnd I was here for almost seven years before the first one hit and end up in New England [noise] they had two major ones that had happened so um you know this is kind of I guess what I expected when I first got here now suddenly it was kind of see a couple of line up the last two or three years so hopefully that that's it for a while um I've seen some old pictures from the island when this first\nLong ago he was kind of first kind of put on a map and I saw some old pictures or John wranglings\nHouse that was on the can down there to turn out here and she moved here 'cause he was the safest place from hurricanes back in the you know the twenties so on and maybe he maybe he had a little bit more in second I thought\nWell hey we wish you continued luck there not a
