{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "As a result of that we also started to see a greater rising casualties and it takes anywhere from eight to ten years to grow a season special operator there the the militaries are most elite\nAnd so Joe Brown seeing the rise of casualties had started a program called ...\nAlso known as the special operations or your care program where anyone that got wounded ill or injured seriously in special operations would be a sign an advocate to try to help them recover rehabilitate and then get back to the force and get it back to the fight\nOr if there are so severe\nAnd they have to then transition successfully back into civilian life and so they had what then what's called operation cruise started a nonprofit Mr mark held did and they had their first retreat and one of the very things was that during his wife Denise of is it's not just the service member\nIt's their spouse because a spouse as part of the team to\nI think people listening to the program Jeff understand that it's [noise] it's like when someone in the family has a traumatic brain injury or someone in the family has special needs it doesn't just happen to the individual what happens to the whole family\nAbsolutely absolutely too many times the the family becomes a collateral damage\nAs as a a doctor one time told me it's overseas when you're deployed you learn these survival mechanisms they keep you and your teammates alive while those survival mechanisms to getting grain to you because you've seen them successful downrange\nYou bring those back and ended up bringing them back into your home\nBringing back to your family and it doesn't equate very well with a family lifestyle or family culture a lot of times and so then you've got a couple of things you got guys that may have post traumatic stress\nSymptoms also a very similar to a traumatic brain injury for anyone that's ever seen the movie concussion with the NFL\nThing about that for a special operator that not only is he received concussions from bought for trauma whether he's in a fight or whether he's passionate about is whether he's fallen out of an airplane when the parachuting hits his head on the ground but he's also receiving\nTraumatic brain injuries that are cumulative nature from over pressure over pressure Blass whether it's an ID whether it's car roost off around whether it is door charges that have been done hundreds of times that still affecting his brain overtime\nAnd so those things coupled together\nThen sometimes he's either can be quick to temper with the anger as well as quick to take action\nAnd a lotta time sometimes it it does not always sit well in a family setting it overseas that's what he needs to be able to do and perform and then a lot of time she'll suppress a lot of memories that happened overseas because you cannot let that get in a way of his mission right and and yet when he gets back home that slows down and those can come back\nTo just I Know that for your organization it's so important to have the right leadership and and I hope this doesn't embarrass you but I'd like to share with the listeners who you are you there and retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army you served in special operations for eight deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq you're in Nineteen Ninety three graduate of West point\nWhen you parachuted in Afghanistan and then Iraq one of those times you were injured\nYour spine was injured in the you were brought home for rehab and you while you're rehabbing you earn a masters in science degree in defense analysis with a concentration in irregular warfare you received a legion of marital ward two bronze stars Premera touring service awards and the combat in ... century men's baggage\nTo your the real deal and the other staff and the organization or the real deal as well I don't know if our listeners know what's the difference between special operations soldier and bringing their combat soldier or other parts of the military\nGuys are paying for that an inch or and the only reason I was able to do that was because of a a a different after first thank God and then I had the most\nHonored and privileged to work with very good people and had a wonderful life back home that\nKept things together but they're so for special operations and all of the department of defense um there's only about sixty eight thousand roughly people in special operations are under the special operations and if you will have that sixty thousand there's only roughly about uh let's see around Fifteen to twenty thousand or\nThey're actually what I Would call ... or kick or ... or the elite special operators that are stepping out of harm's way every day and every night\nSo roughly special operations forces\nMake up about three point five percent of the U.S military and out of that elite operators only make up about eight to ten percent of all of that number and so when I when I talk about special operations forces I'm Talking about guys light green varies on told many teams night stalker the other one sixty of\nSeals air for special tactics marine leaders and a rangers out of the range of Italians those are and there are other units out there as well some\nRemain hidden in the shadows others are working in and out of the shadows but uh we're talking about the the very top tip of the spear if you will out of all of America's military forces\nThis is Joe Geiger on the Lincoln radio program my guest today is Jeff Hodgson he's executive director of an organization called\nOperation healing forces and and also I'm a retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Jeff what are the goals of operation healing forces what do you hope to accomplish with the services that you provide\nOur mission was approaching the only forces to serve the needs of our active\nDuty in recent veteran wounded Ylan injured special operations forces and their spouses are starting or continuing the process of mentally physically and emotionally healing and preparation to return them to the fight or help them successfully transitioned into civilian life\nAnd that trust comes pretty quickly when they know who the facilitator the debris treat our and they know that their their peer group at this retreat arms like in similar situations to what they experienced\nAbsolutely they've all whether it's a seal a ranger greenery\nMarine writer they've all served and similar areas they've all been on several missions and unfortunately they all lost friends that they may know and so as I realize it's they're not going to be stuck in a room and they're not going to be analyzed by shrinks her doctor and like that is a a group of brothers and sisters\nComing together to see a better subtle live in a good part of the United states and be able to talk about some of the things they've been through and how to prepare for the road ahead\nAnd they develop a little bit of a peer to peer group where the military can can see there are other guys going through the same guys being male and female going through the same kinds of challenges I'm going through and the spouses can also develop that kind of a support group\nAbsolutely we've got over a Ninety seven percent of our folks that have been through our program tell us that they made some of their best friends on a tree and and still stay in touch today even though they may live at different areas of the country\nI can imagine as these folks graduate out of the retreat that they're very motivated and very comforted by what happened what's the last thing what's the ... the power that keeps them going once they leave\nI think one of the on the big things it's almost ... the issue will when folks come on one of these retreats is\nAnd this happened to me to the very beginning ... years ago is it you arriving are not quite sure what to expect you're almost thinking like yo this sounds too good to be true and then you get there and you realize that someone is not only donating their home be to stay in and allow you to sleep and their bed and\nProvide you meals and activities not just for you\nBut also for your wife that either one of the most powerful things as people start to realize that people care too many times these guys are deploying and it's not in the news in October seventh\nJust this past couple of weeks to Seventeen fear of of the war and very few people realized that special operations have been continually deploying into combat now for Seventeen years\nJeff what you're talking about has to be very rewarding but it also has to be very exhausting so at the end of the day how do you know you're making a difference I read the book with the testimonials that have come in and it's amazing when you share one or two of those\nWere the quotes that always stays with me and there are several but uh I had a gentleman come up about the three retreat he said hey Jeff you know they're twenty two veteran suicides a day I said yeah I've heard that he's like well you know tomorrow they're only be twenty more\nI looked at and what are you know ... what do you mean by that he said well because of this retreat\nBecause this happened yeah I won't be one of those twenty two\nTomorrow when that's incredibly moving as anyone listening to this program with like more information now can they find you\nOur website is W. W. W. dot operation healing forces dot org and on there there's a very ... and also welcome and they will contact information out there if there's anything additional they would like to know they're more than welcome to contact me or assault off of that site\nThis is Joe Geiger on the Lincoln radio program I guess today is Jeff Hudson retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army and the executive director of an organization called operation healing forces\nAnd I want to thank you for being against program and I want to thank you from what you're doing for so many people that don't get the thank you and they did a\nFew minutes hearing Lincoln radio journal on your favorite radio station audio of our complete program is available on our website Lincoln radio journal dot com and Lincoln Institute dot org\nFor twenty three years Lincoln radio journal has been hurt on public affairs minded radio stations throughout the commonwealth including\nRight right I said I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt disgraceful way turned back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't waving Nazi flags and singing German nationalist songs and talking about how they're going to transform England usa the U.S in Germany damage I mean that the people are mixing up the Jewish refugees and Germany with the German American ... you know\nUm these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by the government's they're\nThey're just living in kind of crappy countries\nYou know and those countries are crappy for a reason\nUh for historical and cultural and political reasons because they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad dictatorial political culture from Spain whereas we inherited a kind of anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England and\nAs a result they have worse government's worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great\nLatin American economists her and I think his name is Fernando ... or ... ... I think it's called\n... Soto was found out\nThis photo and he said if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from ... drug lords\nLatin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it\nThey're fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people even if they ... they come in and start working their kids will grow up probably at public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a whole honey pot full of benefits from the government\nSo why don't you think is going to happen when they reach the American border\nWell my hope is that we will have the U.S military lined up and choking off the entire border and I think President Trump should to ... he's already said this is a national emergency he should start using it defense funds\nTo start constructing the wall you ought to lay the he ought to lay the cornerstone of the wall gold plated with the big tea on it\nAnd start building the wall let Congress scream and yell blood judges scream and yell he should for their court orders and continue to use as authorities commander in chief to seal the border and you and take money away from gardening Afghanistan's border if necessary\nTo guard at the United states sport or that's what we elected him for we didn't like Jeb Bush we didn't elect Nikki Haley we elected Donald Trump because we wanted to put America First ah if we're going to be global policemen you know a charity begins at home\nAnd there's a crucial point I think because people feel a sense of moral moral ambivalence\nOh these people they just want to improve their lives okay first of all that is true of half the world if you are going to say that you if you pick up on doors and say this sucks I'm outta here I'm going in the U.S up if that is enough to get you went to the U. S. gets what most of the Islamic world would like to come to\nVirtually everyone in China would like to come I bet Bangladesh Pakistan you could empty the world in the United states and our welfare system will be bankrupt within you know thirty six hours but hey at least we feel good about ourselves\nAs we you know starved to death and watch the civil war overwhelm our country and turn it into it what I call a caucus and like so many other parts of the world but what about the moral argument\nI think we should see our country as a larger extension of our private homes\nIf ... if somebody bang on your door and says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room you have the right to shut the door and use whatever forces required to stop someone from staying in your house and eating your food against your will the exact same thing occurs applies to us as a country is our country a comment a home\nThat we work on and we improve and we leave to our children were grateful our grandparents we lead to our children we judiciously accept newcomers or something to offer or\nAre we just a giant refugee camp like the ones we see you know in Turkey and Jordan\nWhere anybody who shows up you have to take him in and then you put them on the same girl and given the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash you know trash cans where the fire is that the future of America\nTo me politically\nThis is gonna happen presumably right before the incredibly important congressional electric right and uh I I I I worry given the bias of the media that we just have\nDo you do in photo after photo of some American either military person or ice person or a border guard up pushing some mom was a baby and then uh it's it's it seems to me they win the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets in at a George Soros funded attorney\nWill know that that's not to forgive me John that's not the propaganda war that's winning the war I agree but the propaganda war you know I may I say right to say one of those ... let me let me just\nBreaking point it seems to me that they win if they get in and they win if they don't get it and I don't\nBecause if they oh good I Hope you're right I Know there were times I you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness\nIf he caves and then Republicans across the country we just our hearts saying we realize the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIf even Donald Trump can't say no to something the it's ludicrous in politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turnout\nLine I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you I Do I think if you dance term if he's yes if you have to learn that that will\nMean in picture and pictorial form that they will be fight between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us because I think people see that this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry because a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back those people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out\nFor its war and otherwise going to turn out to a national impeachment referendum or less space has already fanatical they've got their their ... ready they're ready to go to the polls they've got their dead people registered to vote but left is all ready at its maximum frenzy and hysteria they've maxed out\nWhat the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base a wake up the patriotic Americans to say wait a minute it just their shredding our system of government that destroying an orange that Jeff oh and now they're bringing in case the doors to transform country demographically by the\nThousands and thousands and thousands now Newtown already dot com for the rest of that interview and sign up for the pond cash to get the best of talk radio every day\nMid week a cluster of bomb scares one report in the offices in the homes of a number of Democrats among them George Soros Hillary Clinton and president bronco violence you discuss the threat with Texas Senator Ted Cruz as you'll hear in the interview he was flirting with layer and China's switch off planes why I'm here today but enough about that enjoyed insect\nWithout Sen Cruz talked me a little bit about these nine a suspicious packages at least one it was a real bomb the president's condemned with vice presidents condemned that Rod Rosenstein condemned I'm sure you're going to condemn it with the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy\nIt's either some nut in the basement or it's a hostile power messing with our election\nBut what do you make can be attempt to blame Trump\nI look at it the media dealing with the media does which which it any any narrative that they can twist against Trump they will do so with this ... this is terrorism and whoever the terrorist is\nI Need to be caught in eats the prosecutor needs to be put in jail for a long long time\nAnd a and confidence that'll happen you know it's interesting you remember some months ago uh we we had the bomber in Austin a that was setting up bombs throughout all stood and and I met with uh the ... the FBI of we're leading that effort or set of end at the\nFederal law enforcement had tremendous resources to put\nA bear it to track him down in terms of the components of the bomb I Know there I'm sure they're analyzing all of those now where to catch this guy or to put him behind bars but but it is wrong violence is always role\nOr wherever it occurs on the political spectrum light you know we saw tragically a year ago a phrase gunman coming to Washington DC\nOr if the objective of shooting Republican Congress and and and ultimately go into the congressional baseball practice and and and shooting it nearly killing states elites an end\nTo this should not be part of our political discourse disagreement a spy that even healthy to disagree on policy issues ah but but violence has no place for that and and and we need to be able to disagree with each other or with civility and with respect\nDo you believe that the Democrats modify their behavior in the next two years or has President Trump just simply driven them crazy\nYou don't even know anybody that doesn't have ID and if you know somebody doesn't have ID does that person not have the ability to\nGet id and if you don't have id do you really think that\nSuch a person's motivated to vote in the first place army Horowitz went out to ask why people what they thought about voter ID laws and on and on and on these white college kids start to voter ID laws

that much either but it's hard to say there are ways to wash your\nHands so fresh out of their views are less likely\nTo have said IDs minority voters are less likely to have the kinds of I mean I'm describes do require the\nType of people don't live in areas when the access to the Emmys or other places and get identification can always\nGet IDs 'em over the Internet and also with that make it difficult for black people in particular\nYeah you have to have access to the Internet you have to be able to pay into service provider for some ways I think\nThat's harder for black people to go on

about getting high I think there'll be fewer of those but you know it it it helped me come up with certain like fancy and the joke and it was a creative stimulant subways\nBut uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative\nSince I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends I feel like why life is in order professionally in a way that it wasn't it's not as much chaos and ... and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nThat it's happening when I was using marijuana

year and says he asked him for a living you know and it\nBack you know she sees the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all um and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I Would just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know because the the ... the marijuana is an addictive than in some ways it's considered a health food\nUm and so I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism and my family um and obviously\nHad the addiction gene I just did it it just didn't register with me um maybe I should add you know there are ducking behind the dumpster

forgiveness only depends upon me but\nReconciliation well that depends on a number of things if there's going to be a reunion a reconciliation when you're a fender and he does have to demonstrate repentance has to rebuild that trust has to be aware of the hurt but these broad into your life\nAnd that means there needs to be a time that you can find him and you let him know your forgiving him and you make steps toward reconciliation now\nWas true in Joseph sly Joseph desired more than just the freedom of personal forgiveness they wanted to be reunited with his brother's from him he had been a strange all these years but he knew for that to happen\nThey would have to be repenting for what they had done to them so how would he know\nIf they were really repentant and ready for reconciliation would that leads us to genesis chapter forty four\nThis is one of the strangest tractors and all of the Bible back it is so bizarre oh that Martin Luther argue that shouldn't be even included in the Bible\nBut I don't think Martin Luther really understood what was going on here because it's crucial to the Joseph's story remember genesis forty four\nIs before genesis forty five when Joseph reveals himself to his brothers\nSo at this point and Jennifer is forty four the brothers have come they've asked for food and so that they can go back to Canaan and Joseph says well before I let you go what type of big party let's have a big feast and your honor\nBut what they didn't know was Joseph was about to engage in a frame and blame operation\nTo see how repentance his brothers were or if there was any sign of repentance at all look at genesis forty four beginning the first one and then Joseph command in his house to ward saying build a man's sack with food as much as they can carry and put each man's money in the mouth of the stack\nAnd put my cup the silver cup and the mouth the sack of the youngest and his money for the grain and so he did as jokes have been told and do you see what's going on here they had the the St\nJoseph we're saying goodbye to them they didn't know it was Joseph and so he loaded up the man to act with a grain they wanted and he gave them their money back so he was given to them free but he said do a survey and I want you to take my best silver cup and I want you to hide it and the youngest Benjamin ... sack\nWhy would you do that with diverse for they had just gone out of the city and why we're not far off when Joseph said to his steward now\nGo up and follow the men and when you were overtaken them say to them why have you repay evil for good is not the one from my lord drinks in which he uses for even Asian you done wrong and doing this in other words he was training them\nSeason is stored up they went to the brothers opened up the facts and they found that so called stolen ... and ... says why have you seen that gets my lord who's done so much for you\nSo he drags them back to face the rat they think of this leader of Egypt\nAnd so since saying they were in for it first Fifteen of genesis forty four Judah\nWarner Brothers said Joseph what can we say to my lord what can we think how can we justify ourselves for God has found out the iniquity of your servants behold where my lord and slaves both we and the one who's possession the cup has been found\nI Want you to notice that phrase\nJudas fed to Joseph in God is found out the iniquity of your servants warden equity they hadn't done anything wrong they framed I was Judah confessing\nTo us and he didn't commit that's not the singer was contested into when judo said God has found the inequality in our hearts he was saying we're not being punished for this\nBut we are being punished for something that had happened twenty two years earlier God is finally dealing with us for what we have done to Joseph Joseph is hearing all at this he knows they're not guilty of stealing the cup\nBut he knows what they are guilty of\nAnd so for the first time ... says his sense some repentance and his brother's hearts and yet\nEven now he wasn't sure they sorry for getting caught\nOr they sorry for what they've done to me so he presses the test and it's just a little further he says I realize you're not all guilty so I'm not going to make you all stay here as hostages usually the youngest son Benjamin with me and the rest of you can go home\nAnd I thought I prefer to good deal\nYou and thanks and brothers would go for it but look at versus thirty three I'm thirty four Judah may lose play which perhaps as one of the most moving request and all of the Bible it's a harbinger for runner up what Jesus would do for us all Uber's thirty three Judah made\nThis plane now therefore please let me your servant remain instead of all add\nA slave to my lord and lots of land and go up with his brothers for how could I go up to my father if the land is not with me less I see the evil that would overtake my father you know what are you were saying you were saying the Joseph he was saying flight\nOh train my life for his next wouldn't kill my father visiting his youngest remaining son left here in Egypt I Will\nTake his place and it was at that point Joseph knew the repentance\nSincere was Judah\nRemember who had been the one who had been the spokesman for selling Joseph into slavery was Judah who led the group to leaving that hit\nAnd now twenty two years later shows have seasons change and his brother and it was at that\nThat shows this new his brothers were ready to receive his forgiveness and be reconciled\nNow here's what this point is illustrating you can forgive somebody immediately an incident like the only time you ever\nVerbalize it to that other person\nIs going you since they were ready to receive your forgiveness and to be reconciled you say how can I Know a third\nInterested in reconciliation how do I know whether I Want to take the first step and tell them that I have forgiven them so that we can be reconciled or a couple of questions to ask yourself does that person demonstrate any remorse for what he's done to your\nSecond question is being willing to speak to you or does he always avoid you\nQuestion number three has he given any hints that he's interested and reconciling with you remember for that the evidence of any change in his wife is the answer is no\nThen keep your forgiveness between you and God but if you censor some re Morris repentance desire for reconciliation that is the only time you ever verbalize the fact that you are for giving somebody in order to lead to a reconciliation\nNext principle true forgiveness resist unnecessary embarrassment if you decide you're going to forgive this person verbally and express that\nYou want to do so and such a way that minimizes any embarrassment on their part look at genesis forty buy one then Joseph could not control himself and all those who stood by him so he cried had\nOne go out for me so there was no man with him when Joseph made himself known to his brother's wind and Joseph say clear the room\nWhy did he get rid of all the Egyptians that served them\nEvery simply because it shows that didn't want to embarrass brothers knew he was going to invite them to settling the land of Egypt and he didn't want their than\nTo be on the gossip mine of all the Egyptians so he wanted to keep it as private as

number of years ago and a contradictory situation we were told we had to move out of the school we were meeting in when we were a lot smaller where the move out of the school and ah by the school board separation of church and things will get more serious so we were meeting in school because you have to move\nAnd we didn't have a place to go where no place to me and we have a few hundred people now also at the time and they were giving us thirty they notice or something like that\nAnd we had no place to go so we were in a contradictory situation we look for a place to look for players look for a place we were told no no place to go so we're now down to the last week\nWith no place for a few hundred people to me\nBack so against the wall\nWith sent a letter to the school board asking for an extension we got a letter back but saying no extension possible because the majority of the school board was against it\nBut they weren't going to have another meeting one final meeting to confirm that the decision that plumbing out they had already been made and that that decision would be made prior to this last Sunday we were supposed to me so we pray\nBacks against the wall no place to me and the school we were using was no longer be available to us the meeting was going to be out and we were going to go there to find a decision and me and I'm\nOne of our pastors went with me or the ... as they behind closed doors made a decision\nWe sat down\nTwo o'clock expose began it's now three thirty\nAnd nothing's happening [noise]\nFinally one of the school board members comes out of room\n[noise] and they said we can't quite figure this out but the two main people who are against you have not gotten to the meeting yet [noise]\nFour okay they are not here at the meeting and we can't wait any longer so we voted with the ones who are here and\nUh so you have been granted joy extension for three when she\nGoes back to come on in the door [noise]\nHuffing and puffing well here so I'm really sorry that was an accident on the highway at\nTo get off\nTo come to the school board meeting [noise]\nWere stuck in traffic\nAlmost an hour and a half over the last one of the things was made\nMoment became rushing in which would have made it five or a gangster settle for three thought\nUp between a rock and a hard place so to discover something about God that I Would never have had the opportunity to discover\nAnd the reality of that truth brings to the Christian an expectation of what is still to be wildly enjoy the privileges of life in the now\nSo that they turn a life is not something that we are Speier to over there when we get there but he turn a light the light for which uses is speaking as a life which begins now and continues all the way through into eternity\nSome years ago maybe Twenty years ago maybe twenty five we'd have to go by people would have to prove this in general conversation\nAnd most people would have said especially if they came from a scientific background I never heard such hogwash and all my life I Am a scientist rational as I Know certain things I have verifiable data this is all speculation and beauty is nonsense but I\nFound and not exclusively but increasingly\nThat many of my friends who were once marred by that kind of rational ... are beginning to change their tune\nYou find them sneaking around in the new age section looking at materials that no seasons scientists should pay any attention to it all thinking about angels in dreams therapy and wondering about the healing power of prayer\nAnd asking questions about dwarfs living at the end of their garden and whether fairies in Ireland\nReally exist than spending vast amounts of money and making books number one sellers on the New York times lists that are so clearly full of nonsense that it is impossible to believe that ... people would spend such money while at the same time still wondering about the truthfulness of the Bible\nBut they all have a sneaking suspicion\nThat perhaps there is something more\nThe Bible has something to say now we know why they're sneaking suspicion is there because the Bible says that God has said eternity in the hearts of men and women\nIn other words a man and a woman knows\nIntrinsically that death is not\nA cul de sac that death is actually a gateway and it is for that reason that day\nWhen it comes in all of his finality still doesn't end the conversations that people have\nAbout their loved ones so that even though they may be unbelievable people still talking about where their loved one has gone or what has happened to their loved one or how they felt that level with\nWhy do they say these things why can they never imagine themselves dead\nGerman imagine yourself dead and you're coughing impossible\nBecause you're alive imagining it you can imagine\nIt's still thinking life life life that we would bring this back to the man born blind and the assertion that this is a vital question what are we saying well think about this man who'd been born blind might\nHave been ready to conclude that his big problem in life was over after all these big problem in life was being blind and Jesus Says Khan and dealt with his blind therefore no more blindness no more big problem let's just get on with our lives\nHe might have been very quickly within earshot of people who seeing him now able to move around and enjoy life and a whole different I mentioned as they talked with one another about the experience and so on one of them said just before the parts that well you know what everyone says\nAs long as you have your health that's all that matters which is of course one of the mantras of our day isn't it as long as you have your health\nThat's all that matters is not all that matters snow when you put a turn at the end of the picture now when\nYou asked this question do you believe in the son of man\nAnd believing is the gateway to eternity then it introduced us to our portfolios something that is far more significant so Wendy's or that is not\nAbout his need he's asking him about his native spiritual site this man although he could not physically see needed to
