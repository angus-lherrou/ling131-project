Early voting begins in Tennessee next week next week in Tennessee you just bought a story Marsha Blackburn got a big town because of the cabinet hearings why\nWild because it's sort of awake and sleeping with public vote but the more than that especially in Tennessee with Bill rather than just kind of a unicorn Democrat who who Republicans really do like in Tennessee and really did have a record of than president is that it\nIt sort of brought out in the election which is if you're voting for bread is in your voting\nOr you know possibly a Democratic Senate so Marsha Blackburn had I had had a hard time making\nThat case a for all sorts of reasons and the cabinet issue because basically make the case for her and it helps Tennessee revert to its standard partisanship that we would expect to see in a presidential election\nAnd that's why it's been such a big deal in the Senate races which are taking place than Republican states like Trump and that's why it has been such a problem or Senate Democrats and why it\nHas probably take in the Senate off the table for them so they just you know you is does that does the atmosphere\nAnd about ten days or so revert back to the need for what the term cycle has been but I wouldn't glued that from happening simply because\nYou've seen it before and twenty sixteen and the Access Hollywood tape and mid October and three weeks later Trump wins the election so [noise] I don't like to make blanket predictions but right now this is why it's looking really good what burned in Tennessee and Republicans in others than it was\nI think when you're able to make the argument that vote for ... is a vote for Schumer is a vote for Dianne Feinstein is a vote for Cory Booker is a vote for Sheldon Whitehouse and it's ... ... is a vote for Mazie Hirono that it's very easy to remind people that [noise]\nFor thirty days it's hard to do that for a year but it's very easy to do that for thirty days and I don't think it's just kind of

thing he's very good at this I think it's going to help him to am I missing any places where it's helping\nWell look I um it's helping Ted Cruz in Texas it's helping\nRepublican Senate candidates anywhere where the state is inclined to vote for a Republican but where you know for atmosphere reasons and for candidates raised in\nThe states will flirting with Democrats I look I I was in Indiana and North Dakota in August that I thought that those two candidates are those two Democratic it's almost Donnelly and hike camp or troubled the Dali and hanging around the high camp I think it's been behind this they just really\nIs a duck punch a Donnelly those and hanging around to it in theory should help on a create some distance we'll see if it does I'm\nJon Tester in Montana the other one who has managed to\nWhen he's always a very good candidates the way people underestimate him\nHe had kept distance between him and Rosendale an outlet and Dale is caught him and I think that this has helped to anywhere where the playing field is designed to elect Republicans\nI'm an intellect and easily especially I think this is going to help in swing states like Florida I think it's an open question because the atmosphere of a spill generally favor Democrats and this is a state that swings with the wind it's one of the reasons why I think when you look in Ohio and Pennsylvania\nThe Senate races are still off the table\nYou know they have it is eight or a lead allegation and Democrats were using as a talking point but the mob rule it's not as I was angry about that before I was I was shocked when they broke through the barricades at the Supreme Court\nThe videos that they had the mob in Portland went viral yesterday I just think people have had it with the intimidation politics of the lap pay really had just had it and are going to vote Republican is a rebuke to that more than they were going to vote against Donald Trump for his occasional cruelty and his bowling a China shop stuff\nThey're really angry at those politics on the hill or am I right am I wrong\nWell I think it depends on where the voters are I think you're right where the voters are inclined to vote Republican and where the partisanship is designed that way I think you still have a lot of house district and you have some of these swing states where the president still going to dominate\nAnd and I think that you know for for for Democrats that the danger in this thing last day in is that they lose the ads they have had with independents who have looked at what public ends and President Trump says all partisan and we've had enough of you and that's just been to do\nAnd it's replaced by looking at a Democrats and saying basically there's no difference between you and them so maybe I'll vote for him maybe I don't maybe I vote for the public as maybe I stay home\nAnd that's that's the danger for Democrats I don't think that in a midterm cycle I'm\nThat we've gotten this far along that the the the apple carts than it could be completely reverse and you're just going to have the review switch the other way but I think it's been um including model\nUm the battlefield and it could reduce the number of seats Democrats to pick up possibly enough but they don't win the house majority or they end up winning the house majority but by just a few seats and it's definitely going I think of to cost them\nGlory America from the fact that comes through you inside of the ... urging you to go play mid term madness and your your dot com [noise]\nI put together the twenty five closest

begin with Paul Tsongas which is a weird place to start but for the second time in two weeks John Kerry was what was my guess last week\nAnd he began his career involved with polls aren't as my first political campaign was Paul Cronin against Paul Tsongas in the Boston suburbs in Nineteen Seventy four when Paul Cronin lost there was a freshman in college and and polls August one\nAnd I forgot his
