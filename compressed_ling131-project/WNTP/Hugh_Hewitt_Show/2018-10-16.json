conservatives are Republican voters historically Republican voters that weren't necessarily engaged at themselves maybe were dispirited just given\nThe nature of this midterm cycle are now in a lot of them are now engaged and interested in voting and that's been the difference and I think that's a Republican or anybody that wants to understand is that from cycle\nYou're still looking at a very energized motivated democratic voter no matter where they are in them that they are you're looking at a lot of independence that and many of these key house races at the very least\nAre still going to be leaning or the Democrats but in red territory where these Senate races look like they're speaking democratic upset but I think what all of this stuff that you just mentioned\nWas killed those back

Virginia that people didn't think was there and it may have may have an impact in Arizona\nHere here's my counter arguments when Jim Messina is trading at Elizabeth Warren stop it stop it stop it that is because he knows the effect of having that foolishness erupt right now Twenty one days before the election\n... well ... the well yeah but what he was talking about was bottling it using the message because if you're a Democrat you on all the focus will be on President Trump but that was that's a different question whether or not these guys are still going to get out of all of a broken glass the vote which I Believe they'll\nYou know David this is interesting I I think the political director of the White House deep and just said the president's put the Republican in a position to defy history I think the polling\nGlory Americans who\nIn the early ... way today enjoyment from abroad David\nKirkpatrick of the New York times he is the author of into the hands of the soldiers freedom and chaos in Egypt and the middle east you were recall about two months ago David joined me for a long interview about into the hands of the soldiers which I consider to be a must read primer on the middle east and he joins me today to talk about the disappearance\nOf ... who is his friend David welcome what was your relationship with democracy over ...\nBut he was a source you know he was somebody I was friendly with the fact that we would have lunch together and chit chat you know not someone I Would have over to my house for dinner or something like that but you know I knew and we all knew him he was he was a hard guy not to like\nThat that is what I've been told by the many people I've talked to about this about\nA half an hour ago Muhammad ... posted this Saturday website says ... will some of the Fifteen people parental turkey claims were they hit team that killed ... close friends to ask them what they were doing it in stumble on the day 'cause she'll be died what do you see happening David\nWell the music the mood music for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services\nOr that turkey was likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledged that your mouth show he had been killed inside the confidence in his tumble and that seems like the way things are headed at this hour or last night of a well informed\nSource or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia\nHad identified the person they're going to say is responsible he put it more honestly and said the person that is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and felt like he he this person and intelligence had the authorization to carry out some kind of rendition and that went horribly wrong\nUm if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that does seem terrifically plausible\nBut it's convenient for Saudi Arabia for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nAnd this is the Henry the second defense from when the English King\nSaid ... what will no one read me a bit troublesome praised in front of his lights go off and slaughter Thomas of back and can America the drill it works in you know the twelve hundred in the ... century I'm not sure it works today David absent public judicial proceeding that the west can pursue what do you think\nWell what his works mean you know of force from entering governments make do with a partial troops fairly often\nOr the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point are after all that we've seen leaked by Turkish ah officials and all those been confirmed\nIt's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to repair his ... his reputation\nHe he'd gotten pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up the kingdom kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia I think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting the kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos\nAnd Mark Zuckerberg that he's been accustomed to\nIt in fact the person that has been identified to you by a good source as likely to be pointed to as the prime mover of the rendition gone bad\nUm implicates NBS in ordering the rendition does that important do you do think the royal court changes in succession\nA two elements there first of all I think this person this ah intelligence official who's going to take the blame if that person has tried that person will be tried in that Saudi court so that's not the kind of court we're used to wear the defend it might have an opportunity to blame the ground perhaps\nA second of all a you know in the past a crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession a Saturday and it has changed crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has consolidated power like no figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key\nLevers and so the best handicapping it there's no one in a position of change of rain in to challenge him a while there are many people in the kingdom who are enjoying criticizing him over that he's made many enemies along the way none of them seems to have\nEnough heft to push him out a lot of succession as long as they're dead is okay with it is dead is elderly and may not be that company right now\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king ah not too long ago and she expected me with NBS when he's there\nI'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nSo it is it possible that\nThere is within the guy and this was just a range of possibilities and giving the ... second option which is your ... responsibility but not a guilt the other one as you say someone was trying to take me out the rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of the\nRoyals that I had improved and the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know it to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that's what they would go with I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime but in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative as someone who actually was a friend\nOf a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who felt like he had the okay from the crown prince to do this rendition and who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nThat is the Henry the second is pure Henry the second term is back at a parallel will that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the factor in the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would the Henry the second offends me six a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence red turkey Turkish officials have leaked many people including me that\nThey are in possession of audio and maybe video of from inside the conflict showing who did what in the ... you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that with their U.S intelligence got her pies who often work very closely with the Turks\nAnd then that's one thing and if they haven't
