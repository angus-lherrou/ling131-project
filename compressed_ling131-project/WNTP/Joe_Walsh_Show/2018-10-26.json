and will will tweet it out but uh it's I feel very strongly about it I'll probably do they do in a lot of radio and other programs talking about it but next week or maybe I'll talk about it on this program because I feel strongly about it I've been doing a lot of radio and I just want to say\n... yesterday I called up the doctor drew show right they wanted to help me out of talk about Donald a caveman ... and they started saying like well I don't know if it's a good time to joke around because a lot of the president's opponents are scared\nBecause he has been cited the violent rhetoric and he's inside of the talking about body slamming reporters and what so they they basically are forwarding this narrative that the president's rhetoric\nIs bringing this stuff about ... I Want to say I said on the on his program to Dr Drew I said that is absolutely unconscionable that knew a prominent place would push forward that that narrative it it's really\nHorrifying to me but I'll say on this program I think it's worse than that I think it's despicable\nThat leaders like Dr Drew either to get ratings or whatever it is or saying stuff like that it is it's a stunning it's a stunning thing and I just wanted to say that that I was so sick on that radio program I was sorry that I did the interview yeah that is obviously I Want to talk about something fun and interesting and they they just wanted to kind of push\nThis this idea I fundamentally disagree with a we want to say they were going to go to a break when we come back we're talking about Mormonism do not forget to give the ab ab go to a tax us talk dot com we'll be right back with Cary Sheffield [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] well\n[noise]\nI Need help I've been feeling so low I I just need someone to talk to\n[noise]\nNobody understands me I feel so alone\n[noise]\nOr some counseling is here to help our team of license Christian counselor I Want to help you get the best we can begin a conversation when you're ready now my text your phone or even video conferencing from the comfort of your own home I'd like to give you the first week free\nTo try to counseling dot com let's talk and go right now to try faithful counseling dot com\nWe really want to help you need so easy to get started and your first week is free to go now to try to counseling dot com and let us know\nWhen it comes to your identity and the personal information on your device is there is no soundtrack\nTo let you know you're in danger [noise]\nToday's digital world is so connected it just takes one weak link of criminal [noise]\nGood thing new lifelong now and the power of Norton Security lifelike uses proprietary technology to detect threats like your personal info for sale in the dark Web\nNorton Security helps protect up to five devices from Rand somewhere and other online ... plus if you have a problem our agents will work to fix it no one can prevent all identity theft or cyber crime or monitor all transactions that all businesses with life lock we can help alerts you\nJoined now and get ten percent off your first year plus of twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with annual enrollment just on life lock dot com miniature promo code smart terms apply new life lock with north\nThe lack of transparency the lack of uh the the full spectrum of information about who the founder was\nA and I felt really upset I felt like I had been like to I felt like there were ... whitewashing um the origins of the church that they were presenting this this\nA pristine image of Joseph Smith you and I it took me having to go to the Internet to find out the truth\nAnd it I like to say it's it's sort of like Richard Nixon where the cover up is worse than the crime yeah and what's interesting now is that in the age of the Internet you're seeing the Mormon church actually start to open up more and and they're open up their archives about Joseph Smith uh they're they're studying to be more transparent I think because they've been forced to\nUh and it's sort of that at you and knock you late them when they're younger so that they don't feel like they're\nRight completely I I thought when I was the worst of it in other words you're you're saying that you were a you were blindsided by what I mean that he had many wise that they were young like what what would you like\nThat like one was fourteen which was really upsetting but also the were married to other men because they say that oh he only did it because they were widows or they they were never getting married it's like no he basically said if you don't marry me and leave your husband you will be smitten by God and you won't get to have an\nOld ... ... they're older than me and there's ...

Mormon and I'm actually later on when I was an adult my parents actually got excommunicated because there are so fundamental at a and so\nI've been disowned by them after about five years a as a young woman and so that made me incredibly um strong in the end but also at the time incredibly heartbroken\nYeah this is this is tough stuff people don't realize you know when you make a decision for faith or whatever there are huge ramifications um you don't know what's going to happen you think you do you do what what is right and you don't know how your family will receive a well what happened after that you went to Harvard and you got involved in politics [laughter]\nYeah so uh so after I I\nI I basically skated my last year Brigham Young even though I I was in in the closet doubt or I graduate I got my degree moved to Washington and became a political reporter for the hill political was founding reporter at Politico covering Congress or wrote editorials for Tony Brinkley at the Washington Times\nAnd then I went to Harvard got a full scholarship to study at the Kennedy School of government and that was right that he business policy and really got interested in economics and after that went to work in finance at Goldman Sachs Moody's a\nAnd it was mentioned you're incredibly brilliant please go ahead well I or that or I just have a hard time sitting still I think we're I think probably vote for okay\nAnd then I I decided to come by my interest in passions in both finance and politics and a lunch bold\nAnd you've launched bold TV people want to look at ... where they go\nSure they can check put your browser to W. W. W. dot bold B. O. L. D. dot global G. L. O. B. A. L. there's no dot com and they're stuck on the twentieth century\nRole dot global okay All right so what happened that made you politically shift [noise]\nWell the thing is I I had always been a pretty conservative politically I'm ... and in fact I wrote editorials for Tony Brinkley who used to read about work for Newt Gingrich uh and then I you know as as people in their early twenties sometimes are I uh was a rebellious\nAlso I was also worried that I had um [noise] basically ... later my religious\n... and that's what makes them so tricky because I think that there are some Christians who would say I don't care a it's a different Jesus period case closed there are other people would say well God looks on the heart and if you love Jesus\nOr if you really honestly love Jesus and ... you know your worshipping him in your heart then is ... I guess I always look at the ... chronicles do you remember in there where there's this um there's this calorie means kind of like a Muslim\nAnd in his heart he's worshipping as one but he doesn't know the difference between cash and as one and when he sees asked when he realizes this is who I have confused and so it's interesting because some people get very theologically\nA precise and ... so anyway I don't I don't want to go further into that just because we only have a a a few minutes but you when you wrote this article\nYou're you're basically looking for an opening of Mormonism I have friends in the Islamic religion thing the same thing like we need to be open otherwise what you know we become hide bound and dead\nAnd we can't even uh we came to decide what we believe because if you have to question people to shut up and of course that happened the Catholic Church you know about five centuries ago and I wrote a book about it but\nStill I planted my op ed says that we need to Martin Luther for the Mormon church do uh\nBut I wasn't gonna wait around for that so I left that I actually went to a different Christian churches in the DC area for about a year but I left for lots of reasons in part because I didn't I didn't have a direct relationship with God of confusing religion with the relationship didn't realize that religion is what people do in relationship is what God does\nAnd what did you find that relationship\nI I just last year so that's a mad because they realize what had happened was I\nHad replaced my meaning in life with the gifts rather than the ... the guest and I thought that I Would find a deeper purpose in a deeper\nMeaning through public service because that was the here and now that was sacrificing myself for something that I knew for a fact because it's tangible at to me and I actually think that a lot of young people go through that to it and I think that\nThe ... you know the belief in government as a source of higher power or hair meaning I went to the Harvard Kennedy School of government that Kennedy said JFK in many ways became my mouth I you know assassinated sacrificed themselves and\nUh I I my my ... was small limited governor of of the conservative type a and then twenty sixteen happened and Trump happened and I was like that it\nMight just so so much for what you were never Trump it was but when he became president did you did you become part of the resistance are part of the the uh you know what\nNo I wasn't there part of their the since I was I was never Hillary I just could not at a policy level agree and that for eight more years four more years of Obama type policies and so I was Switzerland in that sense\nAnd I say I was the never Trump or yeah I wouldn't say to people that all the reasons that Mitt Romney opposed Trump or the same reasons that I had put Trump right or the moral problems not having a track record to to ah to look at the terrorists the fact that he donated to Hillary he wasn't conservative enough for me right or all all those\nThey are now do you think with with the with the two a Supreme Court nominations and the tax cuts would you say that he's more conservative than you thought\nOh absolutely what any delivered a so I'm I'm definitely on the Trump train I plan to vote for him and twenty twenty or you know barring you know unforeseen\nThing I can see the big one that I had a lot of conservative and Christian friends who said who cares what he says he's not going to do it like you know he says you can do the Supreme Court he's going to nominate his sister he can nominate whatever the ...\nAnd he said he's going to get to cut taxes he says ... and for some reason I thought well you could be right but I don't think so no but there's something about the way he communicates I think he means this\nAnd so the fact that he uh got Gorsuch in and it looks like Kavanaugh will get in and they did the tax cuts and he put the embassy in Jerusalem and he did all these things I thought wow he didn't have to do that you could get elected in and figure out ways not to do that\nUm and you know getting rid of the Iran deal a lot of stuff that he said he would do\nOr that he actually did or has at least try to do I I have to say many many people didn't vote for him because they said he's talking he's a big talker he'll say anything he needs to say uh and in those cases I Would say thank God he didn't\nRight absolutely and uh you know I I I've tried to take that as a tack of Jon Huntsman who is former governor of Utah and uh he's also\nLess like ambassador to China\nA while he was he was Obama them back to China and now he's Trump's ambassador to Russia\nIs wholly how are we going to another break this always having stick around we'll find

don't take a penny of federal funds right which is a wild concept but they're like almost no colleges are able to do that they got on endowments so they are\nGenuinely free to teach about American style self government and liberty they they teach you about American exceptionalism they teach their kids with the constitution means all the stuff\nThat not only is not being taught in many colleges today in most colleges I'm afraid to say what is actively being taught against Hillsdale their champions\nIn this there's very few very few colleges um that uh that understand these issues and teach these issues to their students but the reason we have a website set up my taxes for Hillsdale dot com is that they want\nTo teach the things to the whole world right now they want a everybody who's able to go to that website to accept what they are giving their students so the same professors\nTeach college courses that are available online for free these are the actual Hillsdale professors

America need to understand and this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court\nIs not you know divided always divided or ideological here politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justices said the jak Philips has a constitutional rights had been violated\nSo this is where we are as a country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices\nAgreed the Jack was wronged you still have to fight these legal battles it still has to be argued an argument argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that\nWell if it's right or wrong you'll be figured out right away no the state of Colorado this totally wrong you guys have to argue at all the way the Supreme Court what would that cost a match sharp\nIn legal built the alliance defending freedom doesn't exist and somebody who has a little cake shops as a okay I guess I'm going to have to fight this now so I don't get run out of business I mean what would that cost just for this one case all the way the Supreme Court\nTo take a case like this is the Supreme Court you're looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney time and fees and all of this involved because you have multiple arguments um the preparation for it and everything and and it's um\nBest part of my job as it were able to look at someone like jak a hero and say you know what we're going to stand with you and we're going to do it free of charge to you all the way\nWell I mean of course to go to the Supreme Court you're not going to get an average lawyer to argue from Supreme Court this is a big deal this is a big deal and everything's riding our whole person's life reputation\nYour whole business jak Philips I mean this is when you're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousand dollars that's your business you're you're going to go out of business and so what are the lines of bring freedom do they do

legal fees and that's why\nWe want to raise money for the alliance defending freedom they defended jak at the Supreme Court level and one seven to two so even the Supreme Court recognizes that shouldn't be a fight we we should really\nAre not have to take these things to the Supreme Court it's ridiculous it's clear and yet or you have to do it in a cost a lot of money so uh let me ask you then\nJack in ... when this uh this was over you win okay now we go around to most people think the whole thing is over but it's not\n[noise] right so the very day that the United States Supreme court um nose to the media that they were going to take the case back in two thousand so team\nThat very day and attorney here in Colorado [noise] um heard about at Google me and they called my shop ask to just to create a custom cake for that person\nIn a blue on the outside to celebrate a gender transition\n[laughter] we informed this person\nThe way way way way way hold hold on jak hold on hold your horses you're not telling the whole story about\nGay what am I missing\nYou're are you missing he said that they wanted to put something on the top of the cake which was a pornographic image\n[noise] um as far as I Know on this case they just wanted to get to celebrate a gender transition was inside them not sure if we got as far as what would be on the top\nBut ... but a ... am I getting something wrong I I read quite a bit about this that there was something about a a demonic figure in some pornographic thing\nYeah that's another one\nOkay well I forgive me [laughter] and that's why I cut you off because I was like I Want to make sure that uh that we talk about that because I was stunned\nWhen I heard about that so if you don't mind my uh interrupting the narrative we'll get we'll get back to the transition cake here but that if you don't mind telling me when did that happen was that right on the heels of what you're talking about here\nPretty much all the same time yeah we were getting a lot of great goes crazy goals but now the civil rights conditioning Colorado has determined that they have probable cause to proceed on gender transition cake and so we're going back to court\nYet again of it or to point out that this has got just about can jak a turn away cakes and messages that he does this is about America's every American every creative professionals right to choose which takes the decree which click\n... it amazing I mean if if I go to in a cake a cake shop and it's owned by Jewish owner and I say I want to kick that says I hate Jews killed Jews every American would say that\n[noise] no that's a torch on M. O. J. somebody walk through the door oh can you know on a show and I\nDo have time to read and I'm rereading if you can keep it\nAll language everybody should read it gosh\nThat's a pretty incredible I got to tell you I ah I get so honored when I hear stuff like that you have no idea I mean the principles in that book of course it's not like I came up with them but I Do feel like I Want everybody in America to know\nUm what it means to be an American and how precious it is\nAnd what we're describing your religious liberty in the history of the world nobody's ever had religious liberty the rarest thing are really never had an a nation to Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh we've had so much of it than most people don't even know what it is and so\nI Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something that just happens in the newspapers this is real people\nFighting um thank you for I'm referencing my\nBook or a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you\nOr you become a hero to so many people because to have to go through what you've been through\nUm you did not pick this as we just said you did not pick this and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom who knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now um but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined a and we have to stand up and fight so now a map\nLet me ask you you said that you're you're taking this is it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so that's happening parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get all the civil rights commission it's hearing\nOr it's biased proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and put an end to all of this um so that jak doesn't have to be dragged through the same six year process again and that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay and and the ... which federal court is that can you say\nYeah so we're in a federal district court of Colorado and so kind of the the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but it's not it will go up to the court of appeals and potentially back to the U.S Supreme Court but we're hoping that\nUh we don't have to go that far that we can get a resounding victory and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado and\nAnd is it your feeling that uh the the president of the ruling the seven to ruling in December or will help the lower courts decide this\nGas or when the Supreme Court sent a clear message that tells Colorado you can't have hostility towards jak you can't bring these proceedings against him because you don't like their beliefs and then as you know within weeks\nFor that ruling Colorado is back at it again saying oh jak we're going to find another reason to find you in violation of our law we think that's a strong demonstration of the exact hostility that seven members of the court\nFound to be problematic and so I think that's a strong precedent um there were going to rely on and and hopefully the federal courts will look at that and say yeah this is too much hostility this is unconstitutional um and and dismiss Colorado's charges against jak for the gender identity cake\nWell I mean I Want to be clear ah for folks listening that you know Jack you're Christian ... you're not an anti gay person you are a Christian with all that goes along with that so if somebody comes to you and says I'd like to bake a cake and says I hate gays because you're a Christian you would not make that cake either\nThat's correct and that got people with similar requests like I'm just going to do that all the work done or God Jesus Christ in every way that again and they can't do that I Can't honor him making Kickstarter hateful or go against his teachers [noise]\nSo I Want people to hear that because you you hear so much um [noise] you know ... obviously we're living in a time where the news is very confusing and people say things and it's not corroborated but it gets out there and\nUh people try to paint folks like you or me for that matter as a bigot and you think well not only am I not a big yet but I fight bigotry in my life I care about these things just as you do or we may differ on our definition of bigotry but we don't take these things lightly\nUh and there are hateful people out there and you're not one of 'em and by God's Grace I'm not one of them and I think people even saying we're talking about religious liberty business not re liberty to hate this is liberty deliberate lives according to the principles that we hold closest our hearts when we come back folks a few more

a big deal so if you can give a hundred dollars they become two hundred dollars or we wanted to raise sixty four thousand dollars\nA by the end of the month we're way behind in that so I'm hoping that anybody listening who believes in religious liberty will understand that you couldn't do better and then giving money to the alliance defending freedom these folks are heroes I Know many of the people involved with lines defending freedom and I've had the privilege now a dummy jak Philips I'm\nAs well a match sharp let me ask you what other kinds of cases are you guys fighting right now that we don't know about\nThat so there's a variety of things going on not only with creative professionals like\nJak but are we actually had an argument yesterday and Minnesota dealing with a videographer a couple of the day wedding radiography in any kind of facing the same thing that they want to do wedding videos that celebrate God's plans for marriage\nThey ah have this and let's see who's going to be who's going to be with us today and we see I\nTake a look I think Larry Elder will be here Michael ... bed\nLast night in Dallas we had Sean Spicer it's a very good guy\nAnd Larry Elder and\nThe more the ... anyway it's these are wonderful evenings if you can get in I don't know if you can get in right now I think it's I think it's over but that's why I'm here and it's been intense week as you can imagine everyday different city\nBut I have the\nPrager elder mid mid in Minnesota okay thank you that's the answer that\nIn life you take the uh you're kind of take the the perspective it's a big factory my happiness my own happiness and in in my happiness approach him in my book on happiness you\nWith out prospective happiness is impossible there are many things that are necessary for happiness so it's an art happiness really is an art practicing there was a book about his book the art of loving unless there's a book the art of happiness would probably is but it is an art\nAnd one of the things necessary for this artistic accomplishment is to have the a perspective\nAnd I I think I mentioned this I I it's hard for me to remember everything that I say for three hours every single day but I think I think I mentioned this just this week so it was in light of this every job comes with difficult parts every job is no such thing is not possible\nSo you have to ask yourself is it worth it\nIs the ... is the\nEr the rewards whether financial or moral or\nEmotional\nOr so many others ... ... is is it worth it I mean if it's not worth it then you have to ... if possible seek another job\nBut it's a it's all of life is like that you have to take the bigger picture is if you concentrate on the ... the pain of the moment it's a problem to Megan Kelly is have been fired from NBC sixty three million dollars or something like that\nAnd I I I did was up to knock her I just thought was not a fan so I'm not saying this because I was a fan I'm saying this because I'm a fan of\nOf a society that has a ... that still retains the ... the notion of safe you made a mistake can you sincerely apologize it's over\n\nShe said something to the effect they're talking about Halloween costumes and she didn't think they should be politically correct metal white people do look like a black on black and look like a white and then she got fired even though she apologized profusely ... tearfully the next day because of the racist history of blackface states\n\nSo that's what the yeah we could play let's play a short I mean if people should should appear but this is what the woman lost her livelihood over\nActually you do get in trouble if you are a white person by the time we are black or white like I was a kid that was okay as long as you were trying to buy a character\n\nOkay so if you addressed if you were dressed as a character in other words you were dressed as a specific human being\nSo\n... you could say it's foolish you could say eats it it it it's insensitive to the history of blackface in America\nBut worthy of losing your livelihood is the punishment especially after an apologies the punishment knocked far greater than the crime\n\nOr love so here's here's her ears are appalled this painful for me to hear the ... the what the left forces it's really like these re education camps and communist country where the the person ... after ... for the for their life as it were in in noting how ... of terrible the worst books here it goes\nBy making tally and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nWe made her they answered a we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another\nBlack person making their faith later or a white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it as that was a respectful and part of the Halloween costume old okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great types of sitting in his chair and stay and getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned
