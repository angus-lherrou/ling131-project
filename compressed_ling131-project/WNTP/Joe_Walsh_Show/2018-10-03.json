CEO Welby E. R. T. and mark Taylor but I Want to encourage my audience to look into this and is why I wanted to have you want as I said so the\nFilm eating out tonight how people\nLook this up I mean if people say like I've got nothing to do tonight where do I go see this\nYeah and I got to tell you were in every major market across the country of out of the reason it didn't oriented movie a league wanted this movie to come out right before the midterms so they gave us the dates they did and it's and it's ... type\nThe up talk show but the second in the Fort Seventeen them all over America and wherever you buy tickets you know whether it's ... and go fathom a bench dot com you can go to the Trump prophecy movie de ... uh oh I Would encourage people to pre by their tickets or his tickets are selling out\nA lot of theaters are adding additional screens because this has got some momentum now and you're\nA as they do sell out theaters they bump another movie out and and give us another history and because it's it's an event oriented type release but uh you know I encourage you to go up more than anything it's a message about prayer and it's a message about\nGod and country and and and you can go on in our lives I think you'll see that this this movie is a very patriotic\nVery uplifting inspiring message and uh so we hope that you'll you'll be part of it and go see it\nWell I think that I Want to tell my listeners that the Trump prophecy movie dot com the from the Trump property movie dot com if you want to find out it's October second and October fourth\nI'm Mark a Taylor is an extraordinary person as I said I've heard him interviewed and I want to interview him on this\nThis program so I Want to get a hold of him and marry a cold beer I don't know how to reach them but I I think that it's important to my audience hear\nAbout this stuff and see what they make that some people will be very troubled they say well I I don't like the idea that people are hearing from God today I had the Bible is good enough for me and so just the idea that if somebody is hearing prophetic Lee in this way is controversial in the Christian Community but I from what I have seen\nA there are some people for whom this is the real thing this is not something they're making up and mark Taylor strikes me as one of those people how did you come to know his story and to want to tell his story comes on a film\nOr a friend who's the bears in mind kind of a mutual friend introduced us a writing the book was coming out\nAnd uh when I met them a while you were saying about mark is so true I mean I\nI didn't know what to think either you know I'm thinking this guy's on your profits I mean I'm thinking a guy with a cane and the you know long beard and you know something uh but I met a very humble very normal guy who ah you literally had a very humble message that God has given them and uh some of the press by that and I'm\nMary ... did a very credible thing she said we need to call our nation to prayer\nAnd ah so I said wow this is a story that could inspire people especially as we get toward the midterms and uh and and you know that's happening again this chain is continuing through them in terms of marriage Dylan bombed and that so I'm sure she'd love to talk about it\nI Would I Would love that and when we come off the air or you can give us that information because I Do think it's important we pray for the country it doesn't matter where people stand\nPolitically you don't have to like this president a right but I Do think everybody is obliged to pray for this country this country was a has been used by God to do great things in the past and there's no reason to believe\nOr he doesn't want to have his hand on this company but he relies on the prayers of his people so the idea that mark Taylor by sharing this with his doctor started a gigantic prayer chain\nBefore the twenty sixteen election that alone is phenomenal what a what a what an idea and as you said it was it's huge I mean it was a lot of people praying for the for the election because people wonder how is it possible and Trump could have possibly gotten elected I Would say a lot of it probably had to do with this prayer Jane\nAgree yeah absolutely I think the the other thing for people to notice in in the at the end of the movie we have you found them gives us an opportunity to kind of a room full active conversation and I've got fourteen world you know faith leaders\nAre people like the former communications director for Netanyahu a people like general boy and people like the former CEO of ...

they don't pray to the same the ... the saints they don't worship the saints and they say that they talk to the saints\nKind of like you would be talking to some I mean what we believe in the Bible talks about the great cloud of witnesses right that when you leave this earth when you pass on into eternity you become part of the great cloud of witnesses cheering on the believers who are on this earth\nAnd so the the Catholics are in the in the eastern orthodox they have a really healthy view in my mind\nOf how those who have gone before us and we would say that they're all saints right and others have done is the presence of God you are if you're a believer you are a saint that's the word right when he was the way over here and\nGod died not because we deserve it but we are here and has died because they died for I Can't\nWear ... and his eyes are pure as I remember I remember it\nWell but but what I'm trying to say is that they talk when they're communicating with those who have

it's almost like there's everything else on TV and then there's teasing him I just watch it because there's so much great stuff on there\n[noise] you don't think you have pride that's interesting\nUh I think that itself is its own sent but yeah I'm not here to judge you that's from my audience to do now listen you know you don't think your pride now why what makes you say that doesn't everybody have pride are are we there is by definition we were full of pride and we need to lose our pride [noise]\nI think we all have an email we don't think we do um and I think we have to fight it because it's\nA natural man I'm Sorry ... human nature now\nBut if you don't think you have pride house to solve your problem like the only way this could solve your problem is if you recognize you do have pride in a sense of entitlement and then you can you have to let that go\nWell I have to pray and ask God to ... let me be humble like jaded\nAnd what is what is the the attitude say about nagging\n[noise] south shall not nag is that in there it's between a line\nIt's a part of the PIN number that's what they say about the Constitution's part of a number there you just can't really see it on\nAny sample of my lack of pride about go go not having a drunk picture in the air book [noise]\nAnd other people having things in their yearbook up by the way had been mentioned what we've been Dr forward to your book about her\nNo\nOkay I was thinking what was in my yearbook so I went to my mom today after Bible study and I found my yearbook from when I was a\nSenior right are you carry it what it said about me how could I not be because we're talking about don't go the drunk camp not being in the air buck by other people being the Airbus\nAnd I thought I Would like to tell what it says about me but I don't want to brag about many pry that like I don't want to brag that you know I'm not doing anything less ... than my yearbook that would be the actual pride\nOkay [laughter] so I thought about how the way the tell tale okay [laughter]\nOh here's the humility part my my mother went back to work and there are and when I was in seventh grade in Nineteen Seventy Nineteen Seventy I was in seventh grade\nAnd she went back to work works all night and slept in the days of that I could they could afford to send me to a private Christian school [noise] so in our yearbook nobody bragging about K you're drinking artifacts they're they're they're smart Bible verses and stuff\nAnd so if I have any viable knowledge or love for Jesus I have to be grateful to my mom and dad\nSo you can't write that and that's I mean that makes sense right but it isn't that true though that\nLike when people think oh Eric you've achieved this and this one is I think well it's only by God's Grace I mean that I had wonderful parents who sacrificed for me and I live in a free country I didn't do that that was done to me and for me as a gift and so how can they not be full of gratitude and therefore\nFull of humility because I Know for a fact\nThat it was not high but it was the lord and it was all of the Lord's agents in my life those who have gone before those who've sacrificed for me I mean those are simple facts\nCorrect [noise] do you see how great the Bible is I mean I'm Still and all that I went to study the added to it then I came home with pending a desire to be humble [noise]\nThat that's our Bible studies for though isn't it it helps you see things that you you know you wouldn't see if he didn't go to a Bible study\nFrom God perspective instead of mine 'cause I I sell for so self centered it's just the way I think he's fighting it do you want to do you want to hear what was that my yearbook or is it a commercial\nNo I'd I'd love to hear make it quick because

feel that\nThey\n\nWould actually talking to Victoria\nJackson Vicki what senior yearbook\nI'm dying to know tell us you want your mom's house this morning after the Bible study what's in your your book well\nFirst of all a it was Seventeen Seventy six when I was ... I mean it was nice to have an effect when I was graduating from high school and\nWe went to Washington DC and my yearbook has chronicled seven fourteen as our Bible verse for our class okay\nDoes that mentioned drinking\nNo it meant and uh if my people are called by my name humble them thousand pray and take my faith in terms of their way to get away they want to hear from having a well forget they don't want their land\nSo yours is Christian in high school I didn't know that\nOkay well I Do that by heart not to brag but you know I'm humble out right now to prove that and then there's a picture my schooling at liberty to Christ and then a because I'm humble I won't tell you that I was the homecoming claim\nYeah don't tell me that because that would seem like you're bragging and humble people do that but anyway we can talk about we can talk about your achievements privately like the homecoming queen and stuff like that you really hit home coming clean I didn't know that that's true right\nWell let's not go there because that totally not humility but let me just tell you this is so interesting because I never think about it I've always loved poetry and I was an English major at first before I knew about acting and I love poetry so\n\nOn a Tuesday or go [noise] which is a fancy way of saying that therefore [noise] or if you will and [noise]\nI Love the word ... but it's not use\nThe water while I can see like ... you know go to school with a guy named Jack hands\nTo\nThe ultimate issues hours devoted to the belief that having a map is useless unless you know where you're going\nYou know exactly where you are but if you don't know where you're going it's useless so why does it all about but it was a big issue that's why it's the ultimate issues that we're after all\nSo sometimes something in the news provokes a subject on the male female our or for that matter the happiness or for that matter the ultimate issues that are not as the case today\nSo I guess it's ... it's a multi faceted question but it revolves around one issue and that is if you are middle aged adults\nIs it important in assessing you how you active in high school it's obviously based on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd that's the question you're how old is he exactly fifty four fifty three fifty four or whatever you're so you're in you're almost mid fifties\nIf you let ... let me put it to you this way if you had an important position in Europe business where your school\nAnd you had your ... agreement that man had led a remarkably good life as an adult in other words from the age of Twenty one\nSo for thirty five thirty four years this whatever has been a remarkable human being contributed to his community family man as a churchgoer\nWhich to me means something to many thousands would use then what do you pursue allegations of misconduct in high school\nThat's the question I wouldn't if I were hiring for ... for you and I and\nI'm not talking about hiring a twenty two year old ... where the proximity to high school is a few years I'm Talking about remember I'm Talking about the age of Brett Kavanaugh somebody applies for a job at\n... university is unanimous wanna find human being family man community man this person has been and then uh some charges are brought up about what he did in high school or even the exact same chargers okay I Would ignore them\nAnd it's clear what type of adult you would have been I Am I'm not going to look at what you were are alleged to do in high school\n\nSo that's the question that's the it's a ... how important in assessing a human being is their conduct in high school and high school alone\n\nNot not not up to thirty twenty five but in high school\nOne aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nNow I don't have a I don't have a vested interest in this argument okay I I actually was a good guy and high school and I let an anti cheating on tests campaign I was elected the graduating class president I I was a part was a good guy basically\nBut I'm I'm sure that you know things could be brought up I mean that I don't even know about\nOr that didn't happen which is I think is a possibility or in the case of Brett Kavanaugh\nBut happen or not happen if\nThey ah they were kids in in high school who were uh near two wells and who ended up fantastic adults\nSo ... who cares who cares and in effect now I care about how my kids act in high school ... acted in high school of course you care about how your kid acts at the age of five\nThat's a separate issue you you because you you want to form a good person as early as possible I I agree with that but in ... in in the perspective of a life and in retrospect\nWell how you acted in high school should have no bearing in undermining once assessment of this person in middle age that's my position do you think do you think it matters that's the question\nOne a prank or seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nBig stuff big stuff that people left to answer it's hard for me to believe that anybody listening even Democrats\nHiring a person for a an important position in their business Qunu what a terrific person this is and then charges arose from high school within say no I'm Sorry\nIt's clear what type of adult you've been put in high school are you uh you you robbed a a candy store All right that's pretty serious not not not simply\nNot not simply shop lifted some candy bars but you threaten the owner and and you robbed\nBut it is obvious she turns your life around or otherwise what is what one is saying is people cannot turn their lives around we will let no point to acknowledge that you're turning your life around\nThat's why religious Jews and Christians find this notion particularly offensive because they're both Judaism and Christianity so rooted in the importance of penance of forgiveness of tissue vi in in in the Hebrew of of return or that's repentance\n\nHave is this famous Hebrew statement that I'm ... and I'm I'm literally translating from the Hebrew where a panic ten stands the most righteous person cannot stand\nThe raw higher level if you turn your life around the person who never turn their life around and it's been good the whole time\nThat's how that's how and and of course obviously in both religions forgive right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us the whole the whole notion of Christ dying for people ... and forgiveness\nAnd uh the uh Judaism holiest days the day of of uh of Pena tense day of atonement Yom ... [laughter] so religious Jews and Christians understand of course people can turn their lives around\n\nSo ah I emphatically endorse the notion that when you are already in middle age and the blood a good life that's all that matters I have no interest in what you were like in high school\n\nAnd primary where where's your coded cutting off line is el is elementary school right well you know elementary school well yeah that's what people said until recently about high school\nI Won a Prager seven seven six\n\nAnd let's go to will in San Antonio hello will Dennis Prager\nI gotta I [noise] [noise] well I guess\nI could just tell you a little that story um I was a through high school through college [noise] uh yeah I did go live in California the whole thing the whole party scene and you know pot and coke and everything\nAnd uh was later arrested for a dealing and went to jail and uh it was kind of funny 'cause when I before I got you know for a guy that's at our website to get away from that it was me\nAnd um when I pulled away pulled out a kind of caught the last second out of the deal and uh\nAll that food you know about five six years and I like that for about ... just impossible and very difficult\nBut I worked hard and you know turned my life around or um [noise] I've been married for twenty five years I've raised three grandkids uh one's graduated from college worked for major tech company one is a prime you'll off or the other one is just a sophomore in college\nYeah saw that Iran you're perfect living example of what I'm Talking\nAbout Dennis Springer show from the relief factor for you to\n\nOkay Sharon in Dallas high there Sharon\nHi how are you real well thank you\n[laughter] okay oh am I run the same page that never stopped creating and um I have five away some of them were really good in high school some of them I prayed maybe close to God\nAnd all of them would be great catch it so you know I I think you know that they live in the media\nPrince a shattering thing isn't it if it doesn't matter how you've led a full adult life that's what's being out at in the United states of America\nThen I work at a school and I would hope that people I just think young I was like these kids are going to be good you know quick yeah I can and can't be a good parent and do the best they can and you know put God in there and you got it right\nI think it usually does thank you I contend that for many years that my mother\nCouldn't believe I didn't end up in prison [laughter]\n\n... you have no idea how often when I was in elementary school she ... she she thought I was going to end up at J. D. that was the term in those days assured you ever hear the term J. D.\nNo right if they if they die it's a very interesting juvenile delinquent not a doctor or a jurisprudence\nJ.
