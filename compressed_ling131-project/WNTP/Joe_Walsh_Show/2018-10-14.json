where I'd like to interview the person you know I don't yell at I don't curse I don't\nKnow the little I just I'm puzzled it's just puzzled how people could see things that are that are so obviously not true about how the mind go there\nAll the so Brett Kavanaugh is in there by the way I heard today's he's been installed\nAnd apparently the Lena\nKagan was present at the swearing in were you aware of that and I believe Ruth Bader Ginsburg when as well\nI guess there are ... those two a liberal women on the Supreme Court incidentally [laughter] so typical [laughter] oh he\nCan be a good justice because he attacked the Democrats in the uh in his hearing because there was no reason to attack the Democrats as we know they they they were running a fine shipped their Lindsey Graham who is is you know who is is bridge building a Republican is exists\nI I should play it again I should play that periodically for the next year to remind people that's how good he was\nAnyway people forget the you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave a speech which she attack Donald Trump ... justice\nAnd indeed means nothing it means nothing like it didn't happen\nSo if he's invalidated for attacking the Democrats in the Senate why isn't she invalidated for attacking the president of the United states while she's sitting justice because the same rules\nDon't hold for both sides that's why maybe who knows\nOh we should a senator Hirono of Hawaii who wish she interviewed by where where is taking place on state of the union Dana Bash interviewing\nThe senator from Hawaii who is one of the uh more uh well it's not true they're all equally left okay let's let's hear this this is priceless\nIsn't that Republican what they're saying is that democratic protest turned a quote an angry mob and we don't want to ask you that it's you know one thing to laugh and laugh at the Capitol that done per per generation and frankly some of the country it's another thing to run senator out of restaurants\nGo to their home is that going too far I think that a rule that there are a lot of people who are very very much I'm motivated by what is going on\nBecause OK okay that if that does not disqualify this woman from serious moral considerations nothing to\nDo do you do you think that Republican senators seeing right wing mobs go into restaurants and starts screaming and cursing at at at democratic officials you think they would say well it just shows people are motivated\n\nYou understand the moral rot at the heart of the left this is this just say I every day I bring you an example I'd like to know how\nAny of you on the left not liberal liberals just are naive but leftists are truly damaging but so I I just want to know\nWhat why do you how to you assimilate into your conscience\nWhat ... percent this democratic senator has said\nHow do you feel about these people who go into restaurants and start screaming at a at a Republican senator for example like they did with Ted Cruz a fellow senator\nSee I'm torn right now\nCan I what I advocate on the air that people do to senator her role in a while was dumped a Senator Cruz\nSee I Can't do that because I have standards but I I Am curious how she what she would say if it happened to her\nAfter all I Know this is amazing to Democrats we feel as passionately as you do I know you you can't believe that because we're so much more civil than you so you don't really believe that we feel is passionately about things as you do\nBut we rain in our\nBehavior be cause were conservative and we wish to conserve

that advocates the ice\nIf you don't serve a black person at a sort of film\nMy God I guess you have to believe that [noise]\nContinue with senator Hirono place\n\nFor much I'm motivated but what is going on because what what happened the way I just haven't I heard of ... about a ... a lot to me if I'm Out I'm fairly ... after that the four ... qualify why they ... at that\nBefore we don't want to hear from you too if we have to hear from you what about ... hearing that going on with no restaurants path on this is what happened ... because ...\nThat are of the United states any point in our country this ten minutes to vie for that in our country that is a kind of a activists and that occur\nThan with only found ... percent overhead violate the law going back ... how how far that right well\nBut boy is it a violation of the law to go screaming at a restaurant\nThis is the visit of disturbing the peace is a trust passing a ... question I don't know I don't know any way the white
