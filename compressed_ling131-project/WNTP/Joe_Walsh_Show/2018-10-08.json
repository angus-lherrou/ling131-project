fantastic phone calls this show some interesting items that crossed my screen\nThat it just needs to know about 'cause you got to always stay up to date and boy there's nothing constant but change in the tech world huh [noise]\nWell this coming week October night says the date Google is said to announce their brand new phones of course there's the pixels it's bigger better called the ... three and\nGo actually having some fun head of the pixels free launched the phone leaked and details so I get the company's trying to play it up they Instagram page made by Google tweet out a photo that shows several sizes of the brand new pixel and then the tax the company says that\nThey heard a rumor about the brand new many pixels it's really really tiny and ask how small is too small and some people would probably love to see a smaller pixel but this one is a phone that's small enough to attach to your key chain\nIt's a rumor do in real life it picks those\nGoing to have an edge to edge screen no notch a front facing camera and then hopefully these new picture phones won't have the same feature that the last one did it was called pixel Burnett bad news they're exposed to\n[noise] meanwhile if you're on windows there's a massive update that you have to make sure that you get you need this\nIt has a ton of features including a new dark mode for explore that's an easier way to take screen shots those are so handy but the really big deal is that windows now works with your smartphone better than ever before it's called your phone application but here's the deal windows now works really great with your Android phones\nBut you see all the new tax you received photos right there and windows ten you can respond to text messages right from your computer now that doesn't sound like a big deal but it truly is it's long been offered by apple for Mac and iPhone users I I actually use it all the time\nSo if you want the update now which do you go to the start menu quick check for updates and then took the result check for updates and then you'll be there or just keep in mind it takes a while you can you will need to research a computer and Microsoft has a walk through video on that page in case you need a hand but in other Microsoft\nNews the company actually had a slew of new services to show up you know the big old precedent this past week in New York City they debuted at a quad core surface pro picks\nA faster surface laptop to and then they actually a lot of people were surprised about this court conduct connected surface headphones okay here's the bottom line we\nStart looking at the brand new surface at sixty seven percent more power we're talking about aids and Gen intel chip one gig SST Seventeen hours battery life still one point seven pounds\nEighty five percent faster the surface laptop to being released actually on October sixteen and this is actually the first laptop that Microsoft has ever offered in black little funds back for you there are as far as those headphones they're not cheap turned fifty bucks\nAnd they are noise canceling ear can't so there you know some big headphones there now here's the deal is is also something new is that if you can't afford a brand new services\nThat now Microsoft has its financing program that you can finance ladies hardware accessories or for about twenty five bucks a month or more than you might be wondering if I look at the surface pro how does it compare to the guy pad pro well that's\nReally what you're looking yet as far as the starting price ... the surface pro is nine hundred bucks wow\nThe apple eye pad pro is eight hundred bucks for comparable size twelve point nine inches\nOr they you know pretty much have everything built in you're talking about you know five hundred and twelve gigs the surface pro actually goes up to one gig the weight is about the same dimensions are truly about the same battery life\nOn the eye pad pros ten hours Thirteen and a half on the surface pro so it's really get down to preference if you are a Microsoft percent a new like Microsoft products you use windows and you are really going to like\nSay that Microsoft Surface pro tablet versus the I've had but if you're in an apple person guy or gal definitely just stick with the eye pad pro\n[noise] All right let's move on and talk about the Amazon Echo new research out this past week that you better keep the birds away\nBut did she just said\nThe birds away from my elect said that's right\nAccording to scientists and Germany audio waves this is fascinating from the sounds of birds chirping could be used to launch an attack against the voice says that's\nWhat they're talking about can happen as an adversarial attack okay not just with Amazon ... with the echo but also happy apple surgery and Google's assist Kate using this down the birds chirping\nManipulated in a way that own the microphone on your smart speaker or your smartphone can pick up an attack can I passed detection from the human ears and then start causing havoc\n[noise] so the researchers say that the attacks you psycho Cusick hiding master true intentions and so this bird chirping or something that is some audible could be hidden inside a commercial that plays on television or the radio and had thousands of targets that was\nAll right so you're like OK what has them and yet but when it happens how to protect myself well there aren't a lot of security settings on smart speakers that the problem I mean you put a pin on your Alexa\nOr or you can just turn it off we're not using it but the researchers say that this is possible\nAnd they fully expect that to happen within the near future and speaking of attacks\nIt seemed like anyone who I neat they always want to tell me how great a Tesla is\nThis past weekend I was meeting the c._e._o. of a company I'm not going to see what the company name was meeting him for coffee or about a potential real estate transaction Andrew you have to listen to this this guy is bank I mean he is a big big time CEO\nOr his company real estate and well we were I was talking about maybe ... neither do I was talking about maybe buying a one of his properties sir rhyme with Ronald mom no okay mature and he his company does like five billion dollars a year\nI mean huge and it's funny 'cause like in in like after I came home he's like so I'm busy look\nLike he's got that kind of like [laughter] you know it's just kind of we're in time for Hampshire\nHe's actually a really nice person you know it's a nice guy but but our my real estate agent said you know rather than you to like cause she's what she said to us that you're both quirky geniuses\n[noise] it's a good thing it's better to bring a quirky idiot that's for sure\nThat's true 'cause I was like I'm trying to think like is that a compliment quirky geniuses I'm OK so she got tired of us going back and forth and he and she's like you're both engineers you know let's just put you together so anyway so I go and I made a matter of Scottsdale resort\nFor coffee that Sunday Morning with the real estate [noise] and so I give my keys and the guys look in the in there like you know they listen to the show\nWhich was really surprised because they're like Twenty years old sure and so they were so they were super excited and they took the car and and they were like you know can we have to sell the you know and so it was like you know kind of thing and um\nAnd so then I then I come out and the guy's name is Chris and he says ... I have to show you the Tesla\nAnd he said look at the tests laces so you know in the Arizona Heat\nThe Tesla locks don't always work as this resort has a Tesla to take people like to fashion square in place and I said really anything yeah come on let me tell you the hatchback and hatchback doesn't quite close right\nFrom the heat no cause a bed manufacturers [laughter] and then he takes me over to the other side of the car by the window and there's globs of paint that are just sitting there\nA hundred thousand dollar car a hundred and twenty thousand dollar oh you got a radio okay [noise] uh\nAnd then he shows we were in the front where a piece of the car doesn't really match\nGame for a hundred and twenty thousand dollar car\nAnd I'm like you know I thought that that's really fascinates me because I looked at Tesla's then I guess I didn't look closely and and he said yeah he said everybody that comes to the resort has really super excited about it so now he's the valet guy [laughter]\nAnd I look at my wallet I have one dollar [laughter] I'm like I looked at him and I actually oh my God I'm like you have to see I have one author\nI said I think my son Quinn has been robbed to me that you don't ... the money in your car no I should yeah\nSo I gave him my card and nice and send me an email and I'm I'm a male you some thinking if I sent you a surprise\nSo anyway so that's my tests the story and I'm so that was the closest that I\nGot to that's what the reason why I bring this up\nWe almost bought a Tesla that you know there was other price yeah crazy [laughter]\nWell you got a great car you would you care to talk about your car I Would blow my wife Dr Brzezinski about a new car and she got a BMW X. three okay we have to tell them what happened that he's a crazy\nOh jeez [laughter] yeah they were today so so so that the number one I'm impressed that your credit union called you I mean that's really something right there I don't know a lot of banks that might do that\nA number two is that they were able to potentially passed this checks through no wonder what the banks say that you could do as precautionary means right now\n[laughter] well the only thing that we had to do was to actually shut down the the our account number and switch over to another one and not the the routing number wasn't anything um but certainly because we wanted to maintain a we've been there for years and that again they know our habits that was a kind of a defensive player\nAnd so I so I guess the the big thing they take away message here is that a lot of people don't like to keep track of their checking accounts right I mean\n[laughter] well sometimes it's just very easy not to think about doing that and I and to be honest this caught us at off guard a bit because we were right smack Kim right smack in the middle of but just sold our house and a lot of the house so we are we're right in the middle of moving I mean if it was like a constant\nAnd you know and then when you're moving like that I mean jeeze I mean the last thing you want to think about is if somebody's trying to steal from you know what I mean it's crazy\nUm you know what we're
