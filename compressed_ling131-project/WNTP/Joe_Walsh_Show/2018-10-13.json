um that that now since this Friday I thought were not doing a fun fact friday but maybe we could do a little fun facts how would that be okay you know sure do you do you have any fun facts in front of you know given to me I\nI well we both have it here I Want to share this with you it's the baseball season well it's real winding up of course with the big playoffs the Yankees were in the mental or in the middle of the Yankees were crush yeah yeah\nAt least I got to see my player Andrew McCutcheon I Love him from the pirates naturally but I got to see 'em a little bit who does he play for a place for the Yankees now I'm here to shave the the the goatee and then the drugs and all that cause the Yankees have that I had a policy but he only eleven we established\nIn the Supreme Court

tomorrow morning but but I'm growing it right now I'm using the big state love I think it will come in and stop me hey I don't think so not under said I can grow my beard yeah\nBut I found three things about baseball but you're not going to find in other professional for sports like a football and basketball hockey and all that in the coach in baseball where's the exact same uniform but the players where\nOkay now hold on a second I've never thought of that\nAlbum you're you're telling me that in football no they don't hockey I don't wear a helmet and ... ... they don't wear the the baggy shorts OK in football and hockey\nBaskin basketball the coaches do not dressed like the players but for some reason and this has never occurred to me I'd never thought about this in my life\nFor some reason in baseball the coach dresses like the players that's right and I have never thought of that until just now just because you brought it up brought it up\nAnd here's the question yeah why I don't know isn't that fascinating I Know it is I think it's kind of kind of fun I actually wish this we're calling show because I I Would like to to tell people cause somebody out there is going to have ideas on that we need to we're going to do more call and chosen both worry we will we will have I'm\nNow the other thing is in in in baseball that you can only score on off and it's like in football you can intercept the ball and you know in basketball the same thing intercept hockey intercept the puck but you can't in baseball like if the the batter hits a home run in these rounding third the third baseman can't knock them over and then he runs home and scores for the the team\nThat's uh not up to bat so you can only score on off and you can intercept the baseball or [noise]\nOkay so this is another thing about baseball stand alone there's an offense and then you go in defense in an office in defense back and forth\nSo you're telling me so you're telling me that if if I'm In the field ... ... in my pictures on the mound my catcher is catching yeah there's no way I can score no\nKnow I was just going to say well you mentioned Nancy Pelosi earlier\nShe is the definition of limousine liberal when you talk about how she ...

true but it is true you have individuals desiccated there on the streets okay but nobody's doing anything about it they prefer to hire somebody\nTo wash it down the drain instead of trying to figure out how to get some port a potties out there for people to be able to use the bathroom gave them making them there are there at the ... the human beings are animals that treating them like animals\nIt

I'm sitting here with a smile on my face 'cause I'm Talking to my friend Michael in del the inventor of my pillow a kind of so many different things might eat you just have a natural exuberance I'm about yourself we were talking a\nUh yesterday I guess on the phone before I even though you're going to be here about a this president and how you have been locally supportive of him and you know a part of the reason I'm Talking to you lately because I feel the same thing I feel like there are a lot of Americans\nWho loved this president thing they're aware of his foibles and his errors and his sins and just as we're sitting here we're talking about years since I mean your life was a mess and somehow\nGod works with people whose lives are in a mess that's I mean the gospel is full of that now you could take that too far in ... you become so cheap grades but the point\nIs that why do people so many people love this president and yet some people really know very\nDeeply despise him it's a very strange time we're living in so what what did you say about that because it was so funny\nWell I'll tell you what what I said at the rally was everybody loves our president they just don't know it yet and I couldn't\nSee it at all areas so that is hilarious\nAnd you know when I did I spoke at the rally the other day for about five minutes to pry open it up I said you know I used to because I didn't know anything about politics at all and came\nBy the way you're from Minnesota I'm from Minnesota spoke at the Minnesota rally rally a little while ago you have\nThis about a week ago or whatever and they are and anyway I got one of my opening mines was I said uh you know I was going on his radio station and they introduced me as a former Democrat and they are and the founder my pillow and I said I didn't find my pillow and Vince in my throat I wasn't a former Democratic as a form of ...\nOh my gosh I got into\nI went into I didn't I didn't I didn't know anything about politics in ... and Donald Trump at the time reached out to me before he was the president and ... and the summer of two thousand sixteen in a private meeting August fifteenth drew thousands sixteen I walked into his office with a lot of hope\nAnd I and we talked he talked about what he was going to do what country talked about my my people will be made in the u._s._a. and when he was going to do and I seen his heart\nAnd I'm going I don't want anyone in the country and this is going to be the greatest president in history I walked out other I talked to his employees and it was like talking to my back then there every one of them had a great story bought him a personal story and what an amazing boss is what an amazing man\nAnd I'll tell you what ... that's when I went all and I didn't do any business been out there says oh I'm afraid to go my best day of my pillows yesterday I I have put out everything I had to our president and you have this\nHe's the most common sense president in history he's ha stopped in she listens he takes it and he knows the answer before it's even\nLike in the ... it's like when I find so hilarious right and the obviously the reason that that I was talking to you this week this week my book is launching people laugh at every six hundred page biographies of that but my new book is called Donald drain the swamp\nAnd the Indian I Try to capture the incredible simplicity of some common sense solutions right like people say there's a swamp how we can ... you know like people when you have a problem in this country people act as though it's normal not be able to fix it\nA zero chance that had happened you added to the other when does it become a miracle I mean our presents a miracle I mean that was a you know God gave us grace on this country a second chance and I'll tell you for my platform should be able to regard shows me to use this as a platform for him\nI'm I'm all in and they are and I don't look back and I don't know I just put it out there\nYeah well it's so funny because again there's so many people that they're so sour and so negative that they they almost they're in love with negativity like making anything exuberant are positive are happier successful they kind of look at it like I don't trust it I don't trust it and I think to myself wow if anybody knows your story\nThey notice hasn't been easy you know you didn't grow up with a silver owning you're allowed right go absolutely\nNot I've I've always been an entrepreneur but as for and I've been broke I've been you know completely broke lonely time and I keep trying and even if\nYou you've been through it you know you've been through it but you've you've always sort of had I had a good attitude somehow ... optimism and and here you are\nA all these years later I mean so I I have to ask because people always want to know like when when you said you invented a pillow I was joking around with you I guess it would be less here's like as a pillow\nRise to the level of invention is kind of guy invented a towel or awash claws he really invented that so when you say you can send you invented a pillow what do you mean in other words ... what was it about

go to the other pillow they couldn't do it a third of on dropped out because they weren't they said I quit I I'm reading the bill they didn't want to ...\n... ... or so is the magic piece of this

high or too low you have sleep interruption you wake up your ... a dump pill there's nothing worse is ruined America\nDown down down I used to always say it's a donor you lay on it down a goes you

garden hoses and he said here and I go to buy a bottle of water you know going okay that's weird\nBut don't feel is it just and things are true higher too low nobody wants hard we are from we just want the hype and we wanted to stay there wherever we set it and all the other things that ten year warranty the\nSixty their money back guarantee the made in the usa the washer and dryer and those are just bonuses you know but the main usa is big um I mean here's all the out my my employees are up over sixteen hundred of them now but it's more than that it's all the other companies I effect by

producer night when we are voicing our advertisements on this program from my pillow we came up with the with the idea that it's the official pillow or rip van Winkle\nAnd we want you to know that uh we think that's successful so if you want to use that we're not going to we're not going to ask for much percentage in fact you can have it but I just thought we were joking around that this pillow is so effective there'd be careful but as you might not wake up for Twenty years it's so good you might not wake up well into your new ... well it's quality\nSleep I mean you know the president's ... these he worked so hard and do you know when he does sleep it needs to be equality and that\nYou know I think he like hibernate de goes way down his his pulse goes down to like twenty minutes

students but I I just want to say that was a man that is\nTrue aside from Hugh Hewitt what really really annoys me and only the only thing is when people\nUh miss quote me\nWhen they make up ... that's why I I Want you to know why but you should know I Do a weekly fireside chat from my home it's a it's a university dot com and I ah this week's is devoted\nThe entire half hour is devoted to what\nWas written about me and the Colorado State university paper where this guy made up three things that I said I Know I never said any of them are even close to them can be of course he didn't have any source that wasn't even close\nThe that bothers me\nNew York times lied about what I said and then that was picked up by the entire media and now they all put it in quotes because the

Hi Kevin Cleveland\nIdentify the Pearl was the top yeah thank you that's all\nWe have thoroughly respect everything to do so much for your ...\nWell You're welcome [laughter] um\nMy one question or I guess I got tons of 'em but I guess one of the top of my mind is a ... if\nIt would be of any advice for honoring a parent who's withdrawn or not really interested in being involved with me and my family it kind of come back to divorce issues and what your previous who talk in the past our um\nBut or I guess residual effects from a divorced childhood [noise] um but I guess in starting a new family started over which my mom has done the same and she has a totally different experience but I'm with him and I don't know if it's more\nWhen I get me let me try and understand something so he that your parents divorced and then he withdrew from you\nAre I guess not not necessarily or not I I'm not intentional outside but\nThey're like over ... years\nHaven't started new families both of them my father is more kind of involved with the new you know his his wife\nAnd right so I did so why why summarized you accurately you're saying that he withdrew from you because he became preoccupied with the new alright seems that way so you're asking how old are you\nHonor him 'cause I'm a big one on honoring parents in almost every case so I don't know so\nMy my biggest widely I Believe about okay well that's my biggest example of honoring parents staying in communication if they don't if they are a\nAmbivalent or if they are recalcitrant are hesitant\nYou have to do what you have to do\nSo uh you you you make you make periodic calls or you send an email just checking in if they don't want to respond they didn't you we have to do the right thing and again this is this is my single biggest example of why I Believe people need religion\nPeople for me to be told on or your father and your mother because of God wasn't behind that\nA lot of people would not honor their parents so since God told me the honor my parents are unless it is an extraordinary situation of pure evil on their part I have to do that how they respond is their business whether I honored them is my business\nYeah hard to have a a one sided relations\nYou're right so what is so you know what they said the you send email and that's it\nYou you will be able to uh have a peaceful life\nAfter your parent is gone you did your best you will have no guilt feelings I don't know what it costs you to periodically got in touch it's not a big deal\nOr if there's no positive reinforcement then there's no positive reinforcement my father called his mother every night she yelled at him every night\nHe put the phone on the kitchen table I hear her yelling at him he picked up the phone and go ... put it back down and me and he had absolutely no guilt feelings after she left this world\nOkay [noise] okay All right\nThank you You're welcome it's\nEither this is the beauty of of\nFeeling that that ... the almighty has the creator of the earth has told me what to do it doesn't say on or your parents provided they respond provided they're nice [laughter]\nYou don't need it command to honor nice parents [laughter] that's that's the whole point it's on or your father and mother even if they're twitch\nFact if you add up the Hebrew word for father and the Hebrew word for twit there\nYou go you
