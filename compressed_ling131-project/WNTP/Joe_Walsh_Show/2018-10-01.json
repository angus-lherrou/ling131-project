security camera\nThat has ... ninth Asian uh hard to hack\nAnd motion sensors and that to a audio capability that battery and constrain went out I'm losing ... church LA at delays um couple of reasons why cellular that I've heard why fight well we don't have it right now we're doing construction\nOkay so this is a construction site [noise]\n[noise] well it's really a home they were doing construction so we're doing for a modeling and things like\nThat and then you're are you so you're trying to watch when you're not there\nYet okay and better thing I've heard Kennedy's wife I can be you know for maintenance shut down and leading in honor a ball or they may have periodic outages\nWell I I don't know about that um I wouldn't worry about that on a security camera I mean I'm just thinking about my house I don't know the last time we actually had a wife I outage\nAnd you're in a pretty you know you're in a big city so you're not in the middle of nowhere right um but so what are your are there so you need a battery powered a security camera\nThat will give you a live footage you don't want to record to a card I take it\nOut but I can I mean that's okay but I think we want to have that in the ocean alert you know when somebody is going around the house for if there is an issue or something because we won't be there on a regular basis\nBut hey you know let me tell you what I Would I Would I Would put in\nA and and they don't let me back up there are little cameras that you can put in that are so you'll they're forging enabled K.\nAnd they work on batteries so you'll have to go out there and change the batteries and they work on cards uh you know as the cards some of them transmit and but at a pretty low quality so you may not get back all the way that you need\nA you may see these as hunting cameras sometimes there's a company called the B link and be as in boy link and they make something called the secure outdoor camera okay\n[noise] and comes to the housing how long do you expect construction to last\n[laughter] probably maybe nine nine [noise]\nAll right that's a long time um so at that point I probably up the ante\nAs that or if you will just visualize this with me okay Caroline is that there's a there's a a poll that you're going to put in to a concrete base came\nIn on this poll you're going to have all kinds of things you're going to have a box that will hold the router you're going to have solar panels\nOkay for electricity then you're going to have the camera itself that can move around and so if you want to say I wonder what's going on this side of the property you can move it around uh probably about I think it's like a hundred and forty degrees each way\nAnd so if you so you could do that from afar\nAnd it's really made for construction site pay and of course you have audio\nAnd you have then you have the real time alerts saying uh the first camera that I told you about probably going to send back a couple of hundred bucks\nThis camera again I'm not talking about installation this camera with just the parts is probably going to set you back say four hundred and fifty maybe five hundred bucks okay\nAnd then you have the ... the monthly A L T E is you know you're going to want it on el tea in forging in order to get the transmissions that you want otherwise what good is the camera being they're run\nBy a and there's a company by the name of it is not a big company but they make these type of cameras a company called radius vision\nAnd just like radius and then Beijing okay so you go to the website take a look at it but I think\nUh you know as I've been looking at various solutions to put on a construction site myself and I want to be able to see what's going on I Want to hear what's going on I Want to get those real time alert\nYou know so I can kinda judge how the projects going and who's working and who's not is that that's the best system that I was really taken a serious look at myself against

toll free\nNumber one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four and before I go back to all of your phone calls this show some interesting ideas that crossed my screen that you need to know about first of which\nLet's talk about that little website called Amazon dot com match right if you're already guilty of by way too\nMuch on Amazon this next move I Am as on is going to set you right over the edge\nYou the online stores have a common problem usually get recommendations based only and I'm Talking about only on what you've already seen or purchase which isn't much good if you don't know what you're looking for so Amazon as something that they think is gonna be the latest and greatest\n[noise] to the rescue is a new product recommendation feature that they're calling scout\nScout with Amazon scout Amazon scout will recommend products based on your profile things that you've looked at\nThings that you have never even thought up\nStuff that you never knew that you ever needed before in your life and Amazon offers the massive number of products\nAbout five hundred and sixty four million different products for sale on Amazon dot com\nAnd when using scout and it's going to be turned on for everybody you'll be notified and each and every single one of them that you will have to buy right now so when you're shopping on Amazon will say hey have you ever thought about buying this isn't going to be bad for\nSo many people I mean the one click buying as bad oh one click all oh if it's just bad about a month ago my mother in law was watching my daughter and I walked into the house and I said how is that what we're doing and she just handed me her phone and she said delete Amazon\n[laughter] why she's at because there's five hundred and sixty dollars worth of leg goes in the cart delete Amazon does she just signed up for prime two days prior okay well\nThis is this is this is like this is nasty stuff is going to recommend things that they think\nYou might want but you don't even know that you might want to don't buy it and then all of these are people that they can give it up I'll tell you I Am I'm really bad at best because I'll say oh you don't need in this new look sick so I go over to Amazon and then like oh one click\nWhen clicks sounding only been one quick to load of the card so I Know when everything's going to be delivered by cancer I don't buy everything Amazon 'cause I definitely do it's crazy everything's on Amazon or I don't tell the kids\nIs a there's a sneaky\nNew font that makes essays look\nTen percent longer thanks to the bigger letters that you can hardly even notice instead of ... times new Roman times newer Roman and it takes them slightly more space than the traditional version each character the new fund has been made around five to ten percent larger\nSo what this means is that takes up more space on a page in a single spaced Fifteen page document and twelve point fine\nWith only require about fifty eight hundred words compared to the sixty seven hundred words it would otherwise require was times new Roman [noise] but you know maybe I'm sick but if an essay requires five thousand words it doesn't matter how much bigger the funded five thousand words it to five thousand words\nI mean if anything you need to print out where pages\nAre and if you're an apple fan boy or girl apples Iowa's twelve is out in a lot of people are really excited about the new features\nI mean there's something called ease them I don't know if you've heard about that let you add another carrier was that actually using a sim card\nThere's group face time now up to thirty two different people you can use Google Maps in ways with car play a three had some short cuts there are better battery management tools and of course you can read all about what's going on with oh it's twelve at commando dot com\nBut one new feature that parents were excited about was something that they're calling screen time it was also really aimed at adults who what do you want to see how much time you're using on your phone what you're doing\nIts ways distant limits on how and when the kids are using the phones in the rye pets well it was that about one single day when reports the kids finding ways around the restrictions started surfacing\nOne read it user noted that if a child download an app that has been previously removed from the device than they can read download the app and use it again without any restrictions\nAnother issue seems to allow the kids to get time limits by simply changing the clock on the device so if you're given a one hour Minecraft day they can push the day to the next day gives you another\nKids can also get around bedtime restrictions by changing the clock so as with all the two of the nature of the golden rule still supplied still remains the same rather supervision no parental controls are perfect and workarounds normally exists that the kids can export\nOr when it comes time to picking out you know which gadget gizmo truly truly works\nYou know I go over to Consumer Reports a lot of times and I was really surprised that they announced this past week that they're recommending Microsoft's surface laptops you know after stripping it's recommended badge from the line of computers last year over reliability concerns\nSt Consumer Reports originally revoked his recommendation they had Ninety thousand laptop and tablet or say they've had a twenty five percent of the Microsoft Surface owners have problems by the end of the second year of owning the device well the latest survey says that the longer the case\nThey didn't exactly disclosed the numbers from the polling but the newly regained recommendation opposed to most of the Microsoft Surface tablets surface pro disservice laptop and the surface book to\nMissing is the tanning surface go\nUm and it isn't getting the recommendation due to poor performance so it seems and he'll get Microsoft they've probably just scratched the surface here [laughter]\nSorry [laughter] All right speaking of two factor authentication do you have an enabled on your Facebook account on your Instagram account well if you do you have better cyber security than about Ninety percent of all State Department officials yes it's true in a letter released\nOr US Senators noted that experts were able to easily exploit vulnerabilities\nAnd the state department email account okay this is really important stuff to re fresher memory this little lead U.S foreign affairs agency and its head the secretary of state is the president's principle foreign policy advisor so\nSome pretty important stuff is probably flying around in the state department email account the jihad they found that only eleven percent of devices on the accounts used by the state department\nHave enhanced access control or multi factor authentication which means we do the math eighty nine percent of those camps can be hacked pretty easily\nAnother report found that other three hundred and fifty five thousand government and military account passwords within a database a hundred and Seventy eight thousand of them were cracked in
