happening over in a poor think about this the idea of getting inside of an autonomous flying taxi\nCould you imagine would you ever do this or talking about a taxi that kind of far out but in reality it's happening the name of the company's bolo kept her at the German company specializing in electric motor rotor helicopters is gearing up\nTo run some tests inside thing a pours a most highly densely populated areas so they did is they invest in Dubai already and guess what it worked\nBoth kept their takes off and land vertically to like a helicopter\nAnd it functions like a drone though so instead of having four rotors than are normally found on a quad copped or you get that is what has Eighteen rotors\nAnd the self driving drones taxi\nAs capable of carrying two people for distances about Eighteen miles let me tell you them I wouldn't do more than ten miles just to be on the safe side and I know what you're asking you're thinking about this and they fly over prison walls and what we can they carry\nI'm just asking for a friend of course can I ask you a question Kim yeah\nI watch the video while you were telling that story yes what do you think is going to be safer a ton of his car on the road with all the cars that aren't or a drone that picks you up potential Wal Mart\nWhat do you think I think I Would feel safer and I don't know if it is safer but I definitely would feel safer being on the road even though the cars around me are being driven by humans in the one that I'm In is being driven by a computer\nI Would I Would be really nervous getting into that drone self driving from drone taxi dozens no pilot just give you the Hebei GEDs yeah it doesn't have any airbags can at least if the car crashes maybe there's an airbag sure there's a chance okay and then he\nGoes to Eighteen mile looked you know as well as I Do but sometimes your iPhone works long\nI heard that and other times twenty five percent sometimes means and our twenty five percent to ... that's why I said I wouldn't go more than ten miles\nI ... just it's OK\nAnd just not only to people so this way you can freak out together\nNo I'm I'm not good but you never you know you would never get it I saw the videos like may be no no I'm I've decided no ... speaking of Walmart it's almost time to get your shopping started for Christmas\nAnd let me tell you the retailers are hopping into action Walmart is going to be trying to take you away from Amazon dot com is how they're gonna do it\nThey offer free to day shipping for millions more items and they do right now ...\nAnd they say they're expanding it's free shipping offer for purchases thirty five dollars and above and you don't need to\nPay a membership fading take advantage of it that's a Walmart kept saying because they want to remind you that Amazon Prime now cause a hundred Nineteen dollars a year\nAnd Walmart says we're also making returns a lot simpler you can either print to return label from your online Wal
