evangelical Christians\nUnderstand that the Catholics had been far ahead of this uh had head of us and that we needed to join for first of all we need to get on the right page with regard to abortion and understand that this is something that God calls the church to stand up for life and so I'm thrilled to see fifty years\nAnd not just that the humidity day but it but after Francis a\nA Schaffer was talking about this that most evangelicals do understand that unborn life is human life\nAnd then we have to stand up for it but most or many evangelicals still don't have in the beginning of an idea of why within marriage they shouldn't use contraception and I've had many conversations as I said I'm an evangelical but I I it's so interesting how we buy into kind of what the world is selling unless somebody really says no\nThat's not okay we just kind of buy into it and they don't even they don't even think about it and there they say oh and you know we've been married five years but we're we're not having kids yet and I think\nWow where did you get the idea that you could do that like don't you understand that marriage means kids and means family and if if God doesn't bless you with kids that's one thing but the idea that you're going to pick and choose you could say well we want to have one point seven kids just because we think we can afford it and stuff and I

line Janet Smith is the author of of many books uh\nUh praised by people like the current pope Mary Eberstadt a you know we've had her on the program and Jan and we were just talking about how evangelicals in ...\nFlex have not only worked together on issues of life or and or sexuality in so many things that we have to deal with in this country but we learn from each other and you were just talking about how many Catholics in many who are friends of mine\nWho have um adopted things that you know maybe fifty years ago Catholic weren't doing like Bible studies or whatever so it is kind of wonderful to see the church being unified in that sense\n[laughter] yes and and another thing that uh I don't know if it's still true some time ago that I heard that\nBut because of the ... and you know the wonderful collaboration with evangelicals and Catholics on pro life matters um that evangelicals we're discovering natural family planning and in talking with faithful Catholics who said you're there in a way to manage your family size but those knocking all\nThese you know really vicious kind of hope for the woman put you in your body that are very harmful in so many ways and doesn't\nYou know involved devices that are called protection wants it protection against what and\nYou know protection against new life and said wait a second um but that natural family planning works by people timing their sexual intercourse so that um if if it's a good idea not to have another baby and sometimes that is certainly the case that another baby would not be really responsible act\nThat you can still ... a engage in an act of such a low cost and making low right\nUm I I started stopped wanting to say sexual intercourse for married people our fates making love but sometimes it's okay to make laws without making babies right but you can't work against the\nRight people don't get that I Want I Want to be clear there because people often or they are you saying you know sex is only for procreation and you think will know however what you just said when you make it definitely not about procreation some you're doing something that is I guess at least on natural\nNatural and really reduce the meaning of the sexual act or a\nSexual act I mean it has made it so that sometimes a sexual act\nDoes not produce a result in life he's done it that way he's made it that that for two thirds amongst a woman really is in for oh there's no baby can come about because there is no egg present or right and in fact there was an egg president for only twenty four hours every month and it can be fertilized for only twelve hours\nSo one has a very short ... reproductive window every month\nOr the fact is a male sperm to live in a woman's body for up to five days so even though she she only once a month or a sperm that was a positive or five days earlier might result in pregnancy now there are some very small chance but it's still a chance and\nPeople come with some precision that can locate that that um it's really about seven to ten day window among when a woman could get pregnant\nEvery kid needs a brand new computer in every kid needs a top aligned bike in every kid needs to talk of the line that\nIt could be happy with hand me downs and you know neighbors give you think that their kids most families lots of kids have ... full of mice close in bags for people given them because they only two kids and my spikes and all sorts of things so I I think that um people have to see that\nI have a talk that has called on the family as a path to holiness that\nGod wants every human being to be holding and he doesn't mean of course just for priests and nuns and ministers [noise] oh that's nice to be wholly and since most people marry and have children\nIt seems logical to conclude that God would have actually made the film itself marriage and the feeling a path to holiness and as you have more children you become more and more generous more and more open to diversity and variety and every kid is so different and and you have to learn how to cope with all these different people and\nAnd then you make their friends and the the the children of their friends and family and community belts where you're rooting for everybody I just I Love to go to sporting events with where there's all these families and everybody knows every kid's name everybody's rooting for every kid and that goes on for a long time we have a lot of kids\n[laughter] that's a good it no it is so beautiful and what people often don't talk about is that whenever you the bigger the family the more you have\nWhat I call a family culture if a company become like a little tribe and you're all who are you you you see also just uh you know we are only been blessed with our one daughter but I thought to myself\nThe more kids you have the more you see what your genes and your spouse's genes can produce and it's it's fascinating to see brothers and sisters from the same parents in some ways similar in some ways totally different if this panoply of a you know gene expression and you should just\nAlmost laugh at how different they can be and how ... and you you know you see that when you have a lot of kids and there's as I said there's a kind of a culture in families when the family is larger and there's something\nI Would argue inherently joyful about that or at least there there's a great possibility of joy in these large family and we don't see that so much whenever I have seen it I have to say I I've just applauded and it's been wonderful\nYeah I Do want to stress that you have to have a large get a little to live large family values but it it comes naturally with in a large family almost you know enforced as you you know everybody has a child and instantaneously becomes\nLess selfish and more self giving him more more generous you have to have someone comes on your twenty four hours a day where we have eight or nine people that are four five six people that depend on you twenty four hours a day and you just can't\nStop going in those respects but people were smaller family thing especially if they see what what are your family's those kids pick up those ... sneak up the sense of oh I'm I'm not the center of the universe there's lots of love and I'm sure is that my dad always said he we had six he had sex and so if he ... he had sex only children and\nWe all thought we were in the center you know that's just kind of nice you know so well\nI honestly I've I've seen this and I think that it looked at the same as marriage where it's God's way of forcing us to fly right in other words\nYou know if you're in a marriage and you don't believe in divorce no matter how it goes you say well I'm sticking with it and I'm gonna I'm gonna love this person no matter what even if today I don't feel like it and that does something to us and Shapes Our souls and it it on some level\nThe forces us to learn how to love and I think that goes you know double for kids when you have these kids you love them so much\nThat when there's trouble or difficulty ah it it just does something to you are in a way and again uh not everybody can be blessed with marriage or with kids but I really want to say that when you live in a culture\nWhere you're always hearing about hey you better better take care of yourself and you know don't don't be a doormat for other people it's like to hear that so much you think yourself a wait a second\nUh there's another side to that store you can given given given give and and you just get more and more blessed by God and I think we just don't hear that often enough so uh it's one of the reasons I wanted to have you know we just got a few seconds left what do we know need to know about this book a Janet before we\nGo yeah I I'm I'm so glad that you're um promoting in among evangelicals I it's not expensive or twenty dollars I think that um they'll find a lot of interest year there's a

the swamp it's uh the response has been so wonderful I mean it's it's a funny thing you put something out there and you kind of hope people will appreciate it and when they do it it just means everything so any way that that that's what I'm doing on the road you already knew that um\nYou know even before I you know chaining else you don't you have a special\nAnniversary today is my one hundred and twenty fifth wedding anniversary\nIt's hard to believe that\nBut you can look youthful view or you could have been married a hundred and twenty five years is that really the ...\nWell no we're not caveman like the people in your book no no no ... we celebrate the months because we got married so late in life so we celebrate the month so it's a hundred and twenty five months spent my beautiful wife and I have been married today you guys\nTV you know then Oh yes oh stop it you know I don't think that's a studio in fact it's just about ready you were gonna move in like one a week or two I don't know we're moving in an air and we're going to start doing these shows from attacks is super\nPeople they're going to be able to watch us do the show that's kind of intimidating\nAnd by the way it's pronounced Liberia it's the Reagan Library the light Barry yeah oh it's more accessible to the whole yeah like Barry won\nAnyway so I was at the Reagan Library last night that might get Huckabee that's got to be on the being this weekend so if you're if you're a if you watch the Huckabee show on TV and it's on every\nSaturday and Sunday and he does the show from the studio or outside of Nashville mhm\nBut obviously here I Am in California and uh so so I did a remote hit\nOn that yesterday but it was just that you know it's a crazy day this morning I think I mentioned I was on with\nThe famous Rick and bubba there that's the radio a duo from Birmingham, Alabama and they're just a ton of fun there's actually something that a lot of radio all this stuff to promote Donald drain the swamp and um\nBy the way you know when you're on the road you ah\nYou get emails from people I got an email from somebody yesterday and I'm just reading along and this is a friend\nJeff Bernstein I've known him for four years uh he is a\nJewish New Yorker who became a Christian and so he's he's an amazing person but he sent me an email yesterday and I had a spare minute I read it and he proposes in the email is just fascinating to me he\nProposes this crazy idea and I'm I'm curious of what\nOur listeners think about this idea the idea was what if the the folks in the caravan were hired by the U.S government he doesn't mean as as a joke is a serious to build the wall in other words what if they were welcomed and you know given a\nPossibility of citizenship and all this different stuff and it's a very interesting idea but\nTo be really honest I Am not sure what I think that in other words I I I was thinking is this a good idea is is a bad idea could this idea to be tweaked so that it would be a better idea so that the government would actually take this idea seriously because he didn't like this as a joke this is a serious\nSerious right right so uh he says\nWhat in the article that by the way I paste I posted this on Facebook and on my Twitter feed people want to read this but I'm kind of curious to get people\nTo to read this to send this to their friends just to see what they think so this is what's Jeff Bernstein says I'll I'll share this he says that\nUm he says we should negotiate with Mexico so that they will participate\nIn paying for this because they're insecure border is a major cause of the problem right so this would enable the president fulfilled his\nPromise that Mexico would pay for the wall so this is really it's a serious proposal um and he says that uh I don't know if you have it in front of you there but it's just you know a ... it says that this would be\nA that charities and churches in the United states could step up\nTo serve administer to these people a while you know they they are they are doing this and there's just a lot\nIt um and he says each of them could apply for US citizenship\nA you know it it's it's it's an opportunity to weed out you know the undesirable the criminals the MS their teens who ... I mean it's kind of funny because we people uh you know when you watch cable news people can these big arguments and he think wait a minute why if you were at terrorists trying to enter the United states\nWhat would be the easiest thing in the world would be the joined the caravan your\nI mean it's kind of like ridiculous how naive can you be of course it's easy to get into Mexico it's easy to join you know you just flip in if you wanted to cause trouble\nIt's it's just obvious that that that's possible see all these good people by the way these good people you see them on TV they are being used cynically because ... you know what it's like to walk Seventeen hundred\nMiles I mean these are people with kids are walking to flip flops like the whole thing is is sort of\nCruel to me because they're wandering and wandering and that there is no promised that that that this is going to end well for them I mean most of these people can't walk that far with kids it's just [noise] anyway I just I thought I Would I'd mentioned that some people look at my Facebook page or or on Twitter I'm really curious\nWhat people think that this proposal my friendship Bernstein ... uh he he basically says that um\nYou know that he's he wants to he wants to know people think this is uh\nThe idea he says ah it it it's a it's obviously I'm you know it's just a massive issue but the PR issue and stuff\nRight there is that these folks obviously are being used by bigger you know higher power so the\nThis is the thing that they are are\nYou know money he'd powers George Soros is probably a behind all this and look if you believe what he believes ... and you had billions of dollars\nYou would do what he's doing okay that doesn't make it any less destructive but this is only logical to me that he is doing anything he can and it's why I think of him as a as a villain but but it's it's logical and so I think that sometimes you see these images and people get emotional and\nAh anyway I just I I just want to say that uh if you're not a getting this go to my Facebook page one of my Twitter feed and you can see this now in this brings up a big thing I have to mention is um I have an

I Want to ask you you said that\nThe mother of Whitney Houston sings in this film\nYeah Dr ... and she is wonderful she thinks that a funeral about loss and uh you know it's just an interesting thing I always think that how life imitates art and a lot of ways and obviously what she went through with her daughter and the loss of that and and uh you know um it just was a ...\nAnd her granddaughter right manner grant or did you you know what I mean has and\nThe pain and the sorrow there and you can see it through her as she is doing this and she's an incredible singer you know you don't really hear about this but she was you know she was famous before Whitney was obviously\nMhm [noise] well that that's big actually that's that's that's kind of amazing I um I was going to say I don't think I mentioned this on the air and and but I mentioned earlier that Tatum O'Neal a ... was in Nineteen Seventy three did I mention is I Can't even remember now that she was in the film ... moon\nAh which performance that she gave in that film this is Nineteen Seventy three she was like nine years old but that is one of my favorite all time favorite films that I Can't remember if I say what you while we're on the air or because we were talking earlier but\nAre just absolutely great great great film a it is it's filmed in black and white Peter Buck kind of it's made in Nineteen Seventy three so obviously to throw back the Nineteen thirties she ... play the character\nWhose name is Abby pray and Addy pray and her dad\nAre basically Cohn ... he's a con man and it's Ryan O'Neal her ... her real like that and they they go door to door in the you know Depression era south\nPretending to be Bible salesman and you know we're going to do all this different stuff with them of course the name is pray and but it is just one of the coolest films a ... ever Madeline Kahn\nAs usual practice she almost the old the show she's such a genius actress but uh honestly Tatum O'Neal performance it's an it's astounding I'm In any event so\nShe's great also and the other\nDay and ladies Iranians at well I Would assume that all these years late forty years later she's going to be forty\nFive years later oh my gosh [noise] but um she said such and such a character so what role does she play in this film\nShe represents the school so she's she's the head of the board um the for the school that does not want the church to be returned right so you know she's ... she's a very strong character in this um but you also she's also so likeable\nAnd that was you know part of the thing about the guys on dead I think franchises that we don't want to show neither you know it's not only we only want to hit the other side over the head with a with a baseball bat we want to show both sides as authentic and organic unreal as possible and especially in this movie you know with the ... you got a pastor an atheist working together you know\nIt's scary our kids you know are watching YouTube or their ... you know they're on their phones arrive paths are all you know there's so much content coming in that it's like how do you how do you direct them to something that's positive and something that kind of has windows on it that's not going to allow them you know on YouTube\nAnything can come up it's scary is actually really scary it's horror five year old our five year old or a girl and you know when you're when you're ... you're going to have\nTo get somebody's going to have to I Hope somebody's gonna make a lot of money helping parents figure out\nA how to keep their kids from stumbling on stuff like that you know there's so many different ways and how ... how does it but that's what I'm saying like you're going to have to make it user friendly but\nObviously are you guys are are part of that equation offering something that is healthy so where do you see this going like what what is happening I mean are you at films coming out you mentioned a\nUnbroken to ... now unbroken too not not unbroken to electric Bogle oh you're not gonna you're not going to use that\nUh we like that but we did not use electric\nBoth the horses are very bad at break dancing yeah no actually some confusing that with the secretary to electric but I'm unbroken is a is basically ... broken I mean what's wrong with me but unbroken is the story of um Louie, Louie Danbury honey okay and it was made\nBy Angelina Jolie he's really left out most of the faith and histories of story of face so the remake you guys are producing that\nYes you have produced that yeah it's already done\nAnd it's coming out and you have the grandson of Billy Graham playing Billy Graham in the film\nYes that's pretty cool and that comes up that yeah\nThat his grandson way him if he's ever in a movie don't answer that question and so it's coming out in October ... and it does it tell the faith\nI mean I Do yeah goes through that whole faith thing of it talks about forgiveness um I mean that's the that's the nice thing about what what pure flicks has ever since gods not dead at kind of opened up the time that we could you know we released between four to six movies in the theaters a year now\nSo and ah this month actually in September we release Little Women\nIn October we release the sequel to unbroken and then after that we released another one called the the indivisible\nMovies so now when it's in Little Women uh that the the classic a sick but we may all caught a book that I so who is there anybody in that that I Would know an actress or\nOr there is but I'd have to look you have to look there's too much things have you ever play ...

real bonus but I Am asked do you know you feel like it and it's such an interesting question totally understandable question\nOn the one hand nobody likes\nFlying every single day for much of a ...\nA and packing a suitcase or again and re packing and entering of a hotel room on the other hand I Walk around thinking how lucky I Am and I remember I I mean it's on a leash and she really just as I did when I started this in my twenties\nI never lose sight of the fact people want to hear what I have to say how could I disliked travel is the reason that I'm traveling is that people want to hear what I have to say\nThat's why there was no happiness possible if you don't look at the big picture all their aspect they is there any job on earth aspects of which people don't enjoy though that there was no ... there's no such job but doesn't exist\nYou like playing baseball and you're paid well to play baseball there were no aspects of of being on a I'm a baseball team that you don't enjoy of course there are talking about travel these guys do it for half the year it constantly\nAnd the work out that they have it's not it's not all farm\nBut any baseball player who whose mind is still intact knows how lucky he has\nTo be paid to do what he loves that's the only way to go through life is to have a perspective on on what you're you're doing so too do you enjoy every single aspect of it there's no such thing it doesn't it doesn't exist [noise]\nBy the way I just like to note for no other reason than I Would like to know what it is today is October twenty four twenty Eighteen and my late mother was born on October twenty fourth Nineteen Eighteen\nNo Nineteen Nineteen I'm wrong or my dad was Nineteen Eighteen\nI made a ... my dad was a hundred would have been a hundred in July my mom would\nBe Ninety nine today and she was one year younger eerie stuff\nYou know when you think about like the roaring twenties you think of the Nineteen twenties but we're gonna be entering very soon we're entering the twenties again\nTo what a big or how are they going to distinguish between the twenties and the twenties I don't know maybe they won't be roaring ... the roaring twenties were the Nineteen twenties and the non roaring twenties or the twenty twenties who knows [noise]\nAny way mum wherever you are and I believe you are somewhere happy birthday from me from your baby [noise]\nAll right everybody how to make America America again elect Democrats and win back the house or the ... the emotional basis of left wing sauce is\nSomething I've been pointing out my whole life Thomas Friedman is a perfect example of it like to read the program and he is considered one of these both liberals he's not even\nHe doesn't call himself a West is but he hates the president and Mrs they hate the president to president represents everything they load the people who vote for them or lower some were deplorable\nWe are the opposite of the Tom Friedman says we are\nI mean it's just the fact we lived differently or we uh many of us are religious many of us a A R like guns remembered that cling to religion and guns\nOr many of us are to actually get the chills that the star Spangled Banner many of us think of this only contemptible to ah purposely meal in front of a hundreds of thousands of people rather than stand for the national anthem\nMany of us think that the United states is the greatest force for good many of us think that it's the least racist country in the history of the world many of us think we are blessed to be American so where we were different than the guys are in the Tom treatments world\nBut I like to I'd like to read to you because he is one of the more eloquent spokesmen he knows how to use language the way I I don't I don't want to use a\nA bad example but the best example with the left has so Thomas Friedman in today's New York times okay it's titled how to make America America again elect Democrats\nNow the very notion that you're going to make America America and abide electing a West Wing party is is in itself and absurdity\nTo the left wing all over the world which has to do with the American revolution and to preserve the French Revolution everything gets philosophical for a moment to show the America will be made America Again by having by having Democrats in power\nTo have a more of a a far more socialized economy as an example really All right so let's take some of the things he says some of the things he doesn't talk about\nThe begins one is still left to say about the terrible murder or moderate Saudi
