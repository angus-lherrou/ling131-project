with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that would function or something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise] ah\nSo you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver as that what's happening\nIs that part of it yeah or I I end up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go visit their an easier way to do that\nI have been an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday and so I thought it would be cool to make a little look at the end of the summer that said\nHere's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday perfect\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in text it ended up being thirty five pages long about chipped keys to sixty photos but there was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could have helped me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up so say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nOr icy if you're looking for a particular after you can always read the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew\nA you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yet so we used to fly you shutter flatly at\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five age word document that a you know these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be one of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book do yes and we got it\nAnd cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word I called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know one\nNo charge and so you so before you look for a particular asked\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it is John right out of work I work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that that\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you've created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they we communicated back and forth on fiber ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for

you set up your new gadget you should always change the default pass for\nMe to get something strong that the cameras won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people are just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers and cameras All right so lawmakers in California you're trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty and makes it illegal for companies\nTo set week default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made in the state\nThe problem is that looks to those Internet connected divide that just mentioned they're made in China\nSo the new law is going to require manufacturers just said complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe come up with a startup procedure in place that forces the user\nTo change the password I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean but how effective is really going to be ...
