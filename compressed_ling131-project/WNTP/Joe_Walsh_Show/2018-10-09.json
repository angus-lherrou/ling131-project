confirming Brett Kavanaugh as associate justice of the U.S Supreme Court\nBy the way how great does that sound Brett Kavanaugh associate justice of the United States Supreme court will shortly after he was sworn into Saturday Michel Ferris he's the c._e._o. of alliance defending freedom\nTo congratulate injustice Kavanaugh with these words\nJudge Kavanaugh has demonstrated that he is committed to interpreting the constitution as our founders intended that come\nThat must include affirming our most fundamental freedoms of free speech and religious liberty which will most certainly be at stake in case that will come before the court\nIn the upcoming terms hey of course alliance defending freedom right you know right is second to none\nIn defending religious freedom in this country as I've been telling you about so far all month or they argue and they win alliance defending freedom does cases before the U.S Supreme Court but here's the deal here's the rub\nProviding free legal support to people whose religious beliefs are under attack it costs that cost a lot of money you and me you can help right now\nShrieking and and and you know of course Mike Pence who's presiding had to you know ask the sergeant arms to take care of these people and and to take them out so I thought to myself this is so sick sounding and on the TV it really I'm not getting it sounded like demons screaming is at some point it got very ugly right\nSo one Twitter I posted the demons you know screaming in the Senate gallery there's they're shrieking because they know their time is is is short or something like that right now obviously a there's two things going on first of all it's half of a joke right because even if they sound like demons but also\nUnfortunately it's only half of a joke because some times demons who are very real do screen through human beings and do manifest themselves in whatever right you know so I certainly wasn't calling\nThese messed up people in the gallery demons right on but you know people like wrote back at me and how can you say that they're demons and even though it was even an article where somebody said that I called them demons and I thought we were at a point where\nYou can't joke you can't say anything complicated you can't see any run new wants people are just right insane\nAnd there's so much to say to unpack this I I thought\nUh in order to unpack it uh we need we need to call in the professionals who do and so I thought to somebody who was possible who's Breaking Bad if we can get so many big and bad and professionally John's mirror cause I can handle is I have to tell you it's so troubling so or can we get John's ... today\nNot as willing him yeah yeah yeah yeah I think why I'm with a pig snout so there'll be relative you\nRide them with pig parts that sweet ah John's Merrick what happened this weekend and what's been happening over the course of these weeks to me um it's deeply disturbing because people some of whom are many of whom I wouldn't expect to know better or\nHave descended into a kind of mob mentality that that says emotion is the only truth it's really something we've been living with this in this country for a long time but it's never been so high pitched literally and figuratively and it has never been so pushed a\nTo this point we've come to a point where this idea\nThat emotion is the truth is truth\nIs ah we're living with it we we've been we've been seeing it people don't care about evidence or cooperation and if you don't give them evidence a corporation they say oh it's because you're hiding it or because the the Senate didn't want to see it or it's just ... it's a never ending battle with raw emotion what do we do it\nYou know what I think we're dealing with is the last two learned its lesson from the failures of the twentieth century they're not imitating the ... of the Nineteen twenties and thirties in Europe because those people sailed\nTheir imitating the brown shirts in Germany in the twenties and thirties because they succeeded and I think the ... the most illuminating way to look at the way the left is operating in America and Western Europe today is to study the brown shirts and what they did a\nThey they went in and they corrupted the universities the highest percentage of voters for Hitler or university students and university professors of any group in Germany\nI mean the bizarre thing over the universities\nThey purchased the books they they they ... how did it they purged books based on the ethnicity of the authors\nJust today to nowadays they want to purge white male authors well back then they wanted to purge Jewish authors it's the same phenomena and I think the best way to understand what's happening on the left today is is to study the Weimar period that's a fantastic book called the death of democracy or\nThat just came out and it really does analyze how the Nazis came to power in Germany and I really think anti ... and the radical left in America\nHave studied the Nazi play book and that is what\nThey're doing and and who wrote this book the death of democracy ... well\n... well\nI Can't ... I Can't hear you well we can we can look it up we have Google here in New York as well you know ...\nWhen Carter heads Benjamin Carter H. E. T. T. and what he says is it was the cowardice\nAll of the establishment in Germany the establishment parties the media the ... the army the churches the industrialists they\nWeren't willing to crack down on the extremists of both sides\nThey they crack down on the communist but they weren't willing to crack down on the Nazis and they thought the Nazis were fundamentally even if they were rough around the edges even if they were using violence even if there were silencing free speech they were doing it in a good cause so you kind of had to let them get away with it\nWhich is actually what liberal authorities well that was an chief on the left today\nI mean look it started in this country but let's be honest this whole thing really it comes out that this is the\nThe bitter fruit the sexual revolution and we saw this in the late sixties when students took over campuses uh invaded the president's offices at campuses like Columbia University right here in New York and the administration did not have the guts to stand by them now the harbor is\nThis is fifty years ago bright\nAnd they were rewarded for it those people who took over the campuses and burn the buildings ended up getting tenure going into the institutions and taking them over and or or facing now is a replication of the radicalization we saw in the ... in Germany and the third day said I think it's really that important and ...\nCall themselves crusaders against fascism well remember the Nazis claim they were defending German civilization from the ... of the Communist Party right\nWhen somebody has been known sing something really loudly ... you know look carefully maybe that's what he's really after maybe that guy dressed up as a fireman is in fact an arsonist\nWell that's that's exactly right and I have to say that you know when I was writing my book on bond offer I thought to myself the horrifying thing really about studying history as closely as I did when I wrote that book is that you begin to see that these weren't deem and these were real people\nJust like us who fell prey to certain bad ideas and all it took a little lack of courage here in a little lack of courage there in the little sloppy thinking here that's all it takes\nUp for a great civilization to descend into anarchy chaos genocide and I have to say what we're living through right now\nYou know I we need to be aware I guess is why I Want to talk to you about this because this is not something that happens in a vacuum you have to understand that this didn't happen in the last year and this is something that's been brewing for a long time so it must be really understand it or at its core understand where it comes from where it's taking us but I Want to\nContinue the conversation folks at the our taxes from talking to Jon ...

I've got a I get a lot of coverage of the Kavanaugh thing in fact I was one of the few people to report that Christine Ford or for six years for the company that makes the abortion bill\nThat amazing that people don't talk about that and um I mean look we don't know what happened with Christine for one thing I Know is if you don't have the evidence you cannot pretend a that anything else will do that it I Would say\nThe odds are lower that it's Brett Kavanaugh than anybody else because they're every piece of evidence she offered that it was Brett Kavanaugh has been completely debunked\nSo I mean the court of law he looks she would not even get\nAn indictment I don't think that you could get a search warrant there was not even probable cause for a search warrant a Brett Kavanaugh based on the shifting invade testimony that forward offered and I think her attorneys core political hit men wanted them\nWorked for short has worked for George Soros or Fifteen Years that's Mrs cats cats um I think they cooked up a story based on march judges memoir a story that could not be refuted that they left out every fact that could be checked it they they\nCut off every opportunity for for for Kavanaugh to offer an alibi Eric I Would like to ask you what you were doing\nAt some point in the summer of Nineteen eighty two\nAnd I'm going to accuse you of having helped me Rob a grocery store or\nOn Sunday night in some city somewhere in Maryland at some point in Nineteen eighty two you can't offer an alibi you can't defend yourself you know it's the charges are so big they were intentional out\nYou know what I have brought up I brought it up on my Facebook page and on Twitter or we have to go back to the novel to kill a mocking bird video on a case where a woman\nAnd her father angrily emotionally accused a man of rape or violence or some people remember the movie maybe read the book the movie of course during Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch defending a black\nMan or the black men are really couldn't defend themselves very well things weren't looking good in this in this little southern town where you know ... the whites really uh\nHad the power and so you have a man defending a\nTom Robinson but the woman who accused him her name is may Ella you'll and anybody who who's seen the movie it's just a searing performance by this woman because the anger the pain it's all so real\nAnd you and I realized John many people listening know that so many African Americans were accused of something sexual they couldn't defend themselves very well they were hanged either by the law quote unquote or by a mob\nThat doesn't connect with Americans he got up there he said\nWhen did it happen I don't remember where did it happen I don't remember who is there I don't really remember but I had one beer\nI remember that that was boil yet what he did was he boil download legal talking points into\nOrdinary language that said to the people of America an innocent guy is getting we'll wrote it by left wing elites hysterical violent active it's just because they want to keep control of the court so that can rural America by decree the way they've been doing for the last\nForty years since roe v weight and I'm not standing for it and you know what I think the Democrats are not going to take the house I think we're going to win the midterms precisely because we saw this naked power grab disguised as concern for victims\nI you know when I grow at once and I also think what I find interesting is that anytime anybody wants to frame thing as a men verses women issue\nThat's a failure and I'll say why because every woman has a father a many women have brothers and husbands and sons that they love to death they loved them they adore them and they would want them\nTo get fair\nA fair trial they would want that and so when they see this railroading maybe they they keep quiet about it because uh they don't want to get in the crosshairs of of someone angry and the family but privately they see\nThat when you railroad all men your real running them too because they love the men around them the men that have play them and and would stand up for them just as I Would my daughter or my mother or my wife or my cousins or anybody in my family my nieces\nAnd and there's so many men that would do that and so when you know those men and you hear men being demonized says all toxic you say you know what they've all gone too far it's one thing\nTo say oh I Believe women are equal in women should have an opportunity to have a career when I went along with that because that was all reasonable but what is happening now is madness and I think many women are seeing the limits of feminism that that you're seeing something in contemporary feminism\nThat is actually not only not speaking for women but its bizarrely anti woman it's reducing women\nIt's answer you otherwise would well it certainly Nancy motherhood but it's it's really interesting woman screaming\nIn so far is now you have to pretend that a guy who takes some hormones and gets his parts cut off is this is a woman and if you don't believe that if you don't believe the guy who said at the moment identified as a woman you have to accept them as a woman\nOr or you or trans phobic I mean how completely bonkers that things have to get before people realize that Terry something the moniker insane\nAt wanting lose in in the feminist move I think the feminist movement right now really does come down to abortion ... there are no feminists organizations of any size that are pro life\nThat there are no women's studies professors that I've been able to identify no living women's studies professor said I'd love to be contradicted who are pro life not one I don't think you could get a pro life opinion\nMentioned in a women's studies department they monolithic I'm so in so far is feminism is about abortion is evil\nWell again I think that I mean I wrote about this in the preface to my seven women book that whenever\nWomen are pitted against men or men are pitted against women everybody loses when you tear down men you are tearing down women women don't win and the lie\nThat it's somehow a seesaw one goes up the other goes down that is absolute nonsense justice true justice and the true love of God elevates every body of but we many Christians have bought into this uh many Christians are people who call themselves Christians seem not to understand that\nA a God loves men and women equally and to to track to to trash a whole group of people this way\nAgain I Know most of the women I Know there there's no way they're going to go along with this but they're going to be quiet about it and I think in the midterms are the Democrats are going to be in big trouble because they've just gone too far\nYeah yeah but when you introduced that kind of power struggle into the family is like what markets did\nWith the class struggle you or your reporting the Marxist model of class struggle into the most intimate place in the world into the family bed drill into the family room with the children you are taking communist the communist idea that everything is a struggle for power and if one gained the other\nWriters and your accepting that divisive demonic doctrine and applying it to your marriage\nWell that's right I thought were most folks I think no

to John's mirror John ah as I said the Kavanaugh thing is really it's tearing the country apart but I I kind of feel that even people I Would have respected before like you'd like the New York times for example you'd think that they would have\nTo deal with the facts and even the New York times\nUh I just I'm strict report Taj they're leaning on this ... there's an article by my old friend Adam live tack above the fold I don't know if what\nYesterday's paper Saturday's paper friday's paper uh it couldn't be it has to be Mitt might be today's paper but it was about how this um this the Kavanaugh thing has undermined the credibility of the Supreme Court and I thought [laughter] I Know\nA lot of us lost faith and the Supreme Court in Nineteen Seventy three when\nThey made up the constitution pulled it out of its bodily or if it's to invent abortion rights out of nowhere what would that's when we stopped believing in the Supreme Court I wanted to bang on the doors of the Supreme Court when I learned about roe v Wade welcome to the club buddy\nWell this is this is what's so hilarious and it's above the fold in New York Times as though\nYes now all reasonable people are are upset about the partisan a character and you'd think wait a second it it became part isn't when people started legislating from the bench and what we're trying to do now in fact\nAnd when did you come to face\nGrew up in church so effectively oh it feels like you know\nWell a lot of people grew up in the church and that don't mean nothing I mean you grow up in the church but it was real for you\nYeah was it was pretty good and yet when I was like Seventeen Eighteen I looked at my parents I said you know I've never actually been baptized so then I get baptized finally when I'm senior in high school and move on from\nThere you go to church where do I go to know where did you go where a black church you went to blackrock I grew up in blood have incredible ... never moved in this miraculous stuff that I was aware of no it was very foreign to me okay so when did you start moving into this miraculous phase\nSo um when I was Fifteen I went on a mission trip with teen missions to Alaska for the summer\nAnd first time I've ever met any real like spirit filled people and I thought well it's a classic kind of story they've got something that I don't have and it's really attractive than if I could have it I Want it\nBut then you have all the how do you navigate the experiential side of it and the reality and the different nuances of the theology that you can explain that age but you feel it\nAnd but I still wanted it and so on the way I got introduced to the vineyard in the when I was by the time a senior in high school and you know John was still alive\nAnd I don't remember yep leaning John was using my ... who John it sorry John Limbert Jon Weber is is the man who created the vineyard\nA and was really used by God\nTo normalize the concept of healing for today deliverance all is great and stuff\nAnd I remember going to a like a charismatic conference in Nineteen Ninety I think it was an Indianapolis something like that and I heard him speak I'm wow uh this is for today oh yeah but okay so and at what point did you think you'd go into the ministry\nUh when I was Fifteen I\n... yeah coming off the summer and I remember being on the summer and we're we're in a room and Alaska talking amongst ourselves just about God and how um a wonderfully isn't all that he's doing and this and that and a real love for them and while we would do that\nThe president's would enter the room\nAnd you're like it was that\nI don't even want to breathe the wrong in case I it was so holy so profound intense I don't want a breeze wrong you don't want to scared away I don't want us scared away as if you could of course yeah but and\nI liked that I it was I was like this is where I meant to be so when I found the vineyard there was that presence there yeah but also I was ... counting the story one time with my brother between Fifteen sixteen years old and I realized\nThe ministry actually that's what I Want to do with my whole life\n[noise] isn't that wonderful at that age has such a I mean it's a rare thing in a way in such a blessing\n[noise] um so ... what did you go to college\n[noise] um I did but I did not at the time I got kinda side tracked 'em by life and whatnot and so I went to college but did not finish a couple of bad decisions early on in life and I'm so currently I Am finishing a theology degree\nAll that funny now you're doing now its way relevant now I think it's way smarter to save college for when you you have a brain uh\nI mean really the only people are going to cause you're so young and you just don't know what you're doing I don't appreciate it and then years later when you really appreciate it you know you can think boy it'd be nice to go to college now\nOh I was sitting down on 'em Roosevelt Island this week and looking out over the East River and I'm doing my reading from ice cores and everything I'm reading is just so relevant to what I Need to be doing it's great it's a lot of fun okay\nSo uh what do you do did you get married young yeah like children how old were you I just turned twenty three it's not that young the well we're coming up on twenty four years now\nYeah and Marine I yeah his ... well no so okay so you got you got married I mean honestly I always say to people if you can get married young I I always would advise and it's a beautiful thing so you only three is pretty normal I think well anyway but so you get married you know how many kids did you have well\nI'm all in all we have five and but one of them are passed away so have you ever spoken about times go oh I it comes up when I'm teaching and whatnot yes yeah\nBecause I I didn't know that story until I read about it and the material you sent us and I didn't know if that's something that uh I mean I I Would be honored if each year a little bit about how many people struggling with this kind of thing and they need to know they're not\nThe only ones yeah it that way yeah it is it the horrible journey and yet I'm the shorter but of course is that of course God's gracious but I'm the way that I have found and it's really started to kind of form something in my life right now\nOf um how do we deal with the pain and our life when most of the time we just don't want to [noise]\nSo for example therapists would say\nTo us you got to go to the grief and my wife and I was treated differently she'd say are you kidding me you're crazy and I'd be like oh yeah that makes a lot of sense so I Would go do that I Would I Would visit as it's it's helpful for me to\nVisit his grave and stuff like that how old was your son Hayden when he passed away was four and\nA half [noise] yeah how many years ago this uh this is ten years ago now just this year I was ten years in June so [noise] um it it's ... some people asked me one time some friends said so how you doing is like\nThree months later and how you doing anything in the kitchen and of course when you talk about this subject it tends to suck all the rest of the oxygen out of the room but I just said to him were in the kitchen and I said well here's what it's like like sitting in a fire\nIn all your friends are around you looking at you with these ... you look pitiful and they're looking at you with this concern and care but they can't do a thing you're in the fire meaning all the pain of it until it's done yeah [laughter] and I'm\nJust trying to describe how bad you know kind of what it feels like and yet overtime is I don't think it's a God heals all wounds and the time he sorry God does your wins time does not ... by itself but if we'll let got into our pain she will Hillary Clinton's\nAnd having all that got into that pain I'm your your your son drowned you said it was you were he was four and a half this is ten years ago yeah uh\nDo you do how do you deal with that I mean you say you got in how do you let got into something like that you\nYou expressed to him and you feel what's going on emotionally\n... excuse me one time I was at a vineyard conference a couple of years later and I was asking or there was a son that came on and talking about you know if you call those to the fire and you don't ... your hand you know I'll I'll say go I'll still go [noise]\nAnd I'm saying lord I Can't do this and I had it just all of a sudden the lord started to encounter me in the same way in that room years earlier and I started to

Walberg rip we're talking about the miraculous return that you've seen this kind of stuff was the first time in your life that you saw an outing out miracle that you just said whoa like I you know\nUh [noise] in in this timeframe uh probably\nUm actually something as simple as a headache we'll lady walk into our church who is a part of our church on Sunday Morning and she um had a migraine headaches she suffered from migraine headaches and sore worshipping God and guts as pray for headache in front of everybody now wait a minute\nGod says it to you you see right there you this is so normal to you but the fact that you hear God tells you to pray for a woman's headache to me that's a miracle like us incredible how do you when you say you hear from God how does that work for you can you describe that to people who don't hear from God insured\nNot not in it for me not audible voice but impression um sometimes it'll just sounded like a sentence of sounds awesome like a conversation and in your head but it has a different tone to it it's like a you know some kind of tenor to it\nAnd I'm so depression sometimes you'll see things I'm this week I was at the meeting and praying praying for anxiety\nWell it was just that I in my mind I saw a whole bunch of people and the like it was the impression of the word anxiety were breaking in society off\nOf people okay so this is I mean but to me that already is miraculous that that got us speaking to you I mean look when Ken fish does this campus as I get a sense that got God is is doing something and this group of people you know anybody here ever respiratory problem when you didn't use somehow I don't know\nWhenever you hear anybody do that we've all seen the phony version of it in movies and stuff and they make fun of it but the point is\nGod really does speak this way and you're sitting here and you're telling me that's what happened so so that tells you when\nWas this one of this was probably um two thousand twelve okay at that point yeah so so around then you're in a service and you feel God telling you pray for somebody's headache yes\nSo because again it was taking a whole group of people and helping walk with them through something\nFrom your well your character you're going to move the church into doing this to exactly and so he has to\nDo this and I'm like wrestling with I'm a little bit and you will do trust me yeah so we did and I actually brought to lead to come up while you knew which woman what had the idea and all because I talked to her before\nAnd the yeah the because what we're trying to do is is sure the love of God as we go so when we're about our daily life not trying to just be event minded with evangelists and British or the guts\nAnd so they saw a guy and they walked up and it's ... ... in the course of their conversation the they realize that he's blind in his says left die yeah just in one eye yeah and just one eye and um so they asked if they could pray for them and they did\nAnd at first nothing happened and then eventually they parted ways but as he was walking away\nThey could see him from behind and he was kept moving his hand in front of his own face and they can see it from back in so he came back up to them afterwards and said when I was walking away from you I can see my I I was doing all this because I could see my I all of a sudden was restored as I was walking away from you\nYou know I always think of people who like by a metal detector and they go down the beach and they're looking for for something\nYou don't need to buy a metal detector you could just pray for people in the name of Jesus and it's not going to happen every time it's like a metal detector like he got a kind of walk up and down the beach and see and whatever but [noise]\nMan when you get something what could be more exciting than the idea that Jesus healed a man's I on the street and only because they pray for him yeah yeah like it wasn't it wasn't you know some big event they just chose\nTo to move and to to to talk to him and then to pray for him [noise]\nAnd and you get rewarded with something that you'll never forget for the rest of your life oh my\nGosh and it's so deeply enriching to own soul bits ... it'll make your day you just walk away and you're like you're good for the rest of the\nI've I've had a number of miracles I've ... I've written about some of them in my miracles book and I'm working on the story of my life you know coming to faith everything I'm In I'm going to put some more of those miracles in the in that book but I've never seen\nThis kind of a miracle you pray I prayed for my dad's on many many times he got macular degeneration one and you know I haven't seen healing a ... it really would be so encouraging to see something like that but I still believe\nI'm believing in God and I'm going to keep praying and keep praying but the idea that your friends\nHad the joy springs and I remember this is angel Benito Iran he was in Shreveport, Louisiana he would preach uh Times Square church and he talked about this that that that that they would uh walk right neighborhoods and pray for people and he remembers that they prefer this guy and one time after they paid for him a few times\nHe was able to see and you know ... ... it's just nuts so yeah it's just absolutely stunning\nYeah of of been a lot of times it takes a few times we had this will happen to be a meeting again number of years ago but um when Ken was in to our church and my my right hand guy Brent walked in this one night with a crutch and ...\nSo the kids prayed over him actually probably eleven times does a crutch turn into a serpent it did not a good good but he walked out with the crutch over his shoulder so he he experienced the change in a blue is my in a wonderful way of course it blew his mind and he's just never forgotten about that either you know\nI tell you we don't when when you start thinking about this just logically that if God can do this [noise]\nIt really feels like why wouldn't we push in even more to see more and more and more because lives have changed I mean if somebody doesn't believe in Jesus and you pray for them and something happens that boy oh boy that's I mean that's how people came to face\nWhen Jesus was walk in the ... yeah yeah so why wouldn't we try it today\nThat's what I'm thinking like Jesus didn't have um events he just taught his disciples the kingdom has your about your life it's ...\nIt's crazy enough um we have one more segment we're going to be right back but folks I Want to remind you we're we're raising money from winds defending freedom they defend religious liberty in this country\nFor free so if you are somebody or that get sued a for you know no good

with another person and um she had not slept in about eight years slip well in eight years from when um she experienced that her husband walked out on her\nAnd so I'm One of the things that we do is we're praying for her I felt this I'm kind of a pencil ... really stiff thing in the back of her neck and you would call that a demonic manifestation spiritual manifestation really Shia rape and you know I mean serious okay yeah yeah absolutely and so\nAs we pray for her trying to figure out why it should not sleeping right now and there was some other emotional reasons to it obviously I Would think however when we prayed and and broke the power of that then you could feel it didn't like it went away that physical thing went away\nAnd then just taking authority over her sleep [noise] um she actually started sleeping well the couple of days later I start getting these text like I'm sleeping grade and this and that and you know I think even those things are amazingly important to people

amount about\nAs a historian specializing in the Holocaust Nazi Germany in Europe and the ... of the world wars I had been repeatedly asked about the degree to which the current situation in the United states resembles the inter war period and the rise of fascism in Europe\n[laughter] that's the beginning of it\nHe's constantly asked isn't that great a P you see him in and of course what he means is here's the irony I Do believe there is a threat to democracy and it comes from the left\n\nBut of course in his case it's all the Trump election do why as a historian specializing in Nazi Germany do I see the current situation and\nThe rise of fascism in Europe as having parallels we know where he's teaching well more he's bother me more aware of the University of North Carolina okay
