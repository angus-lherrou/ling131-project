I mean that is a Christian stories were so of course I Believe in that right questions do you learn something from what you did or you\nAlive to like your own\nWeaknesses and mistakes and the answer is absolutely not that's how you get populist not when you're a leader screw up\nThat right but when they refuse to acknowledge they did and then blame you for it so all of a sudden the middle class is shrinking it's now the minority of the country there are huge segments of our population that are dying younger senior life expectancy corn those are the ... the population are weaker attacking\nSo it's like you know high school educated white men just has to pick this demographic they heroes rap exactly demographic with the highest suicide rate in the lowest like expect the declining life

alcoholics or drunk guy yeah that's what it is\nOkay we're going to go to a break uh actually no I'm Sorry we're not not yet we'll talk let me just say that on the cover of the book the ... the reason one of the reasons I Love this book is that it's a bipartisan swamp you have people uh from both sides of the aisle and people from no sides of the aisle uh on the cover because you recognize that\nThe people on our side on our side very recently because of the cabinet ... some of them rose to the occasion but prior to that\nThey really had not been helping very much and I think that is why we have a populist movement now because the ... if they are also out of touch\nPeople they they have turned you know\nUh they're lonely eyes to Donald Trump it's an extraordinary irony in our history that this man from queens of who's been a developer who has no political experience has more political skill and more common sense\nOr act human than any of these people were going to we are

wrong [noise] ... exactly\nAnd nobody's even now I mean I just sketched out my chauffeur tonight and I'm thinking the ... the obvious question is that one no one addresses so like\nWhy are you know half with millennials telling pollsters that they prefer socialism capitalism [laughter] what's that about yeah and it was a ballot it's really simple young people are still mired in debt\nThat they can't get married or buy cars or afford to buy homes it's totally different right economically from the world I corrupt and yeah I graduated from college I didn't graduate I just\nGot married in Nineteen Ninety One it wasn't a hundred years ago was the east and I make fourteen grand a year and my wife made and\nAnd we live fine you know what you mean like I thought I had a shot at doing better than my parents and I did\nWrite it you know what I mean and I didn't have any family support I mean do you have a single friend who was a trout say moving to New York city for a first job who's not being supported by their parents know you have to support your kids when they graduate college because the economy will support the\nWell the disaster I yeah I mean definitely nobody says anything about it it's like what I Need all that is why they don't believe in capital is\nActually the ... I Would add to that that the reason a young people a say that they're for socialism it's pure ignorance in other words you have\nA in the last forty years we have not been teaching the basic foundational values of what is American self government what is capitalism how these things work if you don't teach these things as good\nA then then people can assume things because they really are blissfully ignorant they don't understand if you've never run a business or you don't understand how bad regulation can be and how bad tax can be if you don't get that stuff and you've not been taught that you are to love these ideas these wonderful American ideas\nOr if you're not taught that\nAre then basically you you're open to any ridiculous idea and I just think the previous generation shouldn't\nForesee on any level and I'm really concerned for the country or Facebook\nOr an Amazon and Google and all of these companies\nObviously they belong to the end the ship a fool's category they lean very strongly left and they have extraordinary power what do you suppose we can do is there anything we can do about that or what do you think we might do\nI mean these are not American companies ... American Company it's a multinational huge parts of which are owned by the ... countries that hate us\nSo there's no there's nothing inherently American about Google you can do it could never have never dropped in any other country their oil to America they have a stranglehold on all information in English\nAnd they could determine the outcome of our elections so why is it will not massive threat it was our company history of the world today don't worry about it and the Social Security administration does\nIn our Congress just kind of ignores it and that and the dumb Republican and they really are dumb are still repeating like talking points from the ... Institute circa Nineteen Ninety nine like oh you know the free market or something\nBut he's on his mind isn't it amazing isn't it a ... well the funny thing too is that one thing that always and rages may about people who think the free market is God\n... if if if we have a truly free market a ... around the globe and their slave labor in another country do I know a moral reason to say the free market can go to hell I Want to buy goods from people that are not and slaves that uh\nReligious liberty this to me seems more fundamental to me as an American then this idea that a borders uh for trade or anything is somehow not conservative I mean it's a it's madness to me so thanks or you know I hate it when it's stupid\nPropaganda that the conservatives including me unfortunately swallowed it never thought about\nYou care about the outcome not the ... I don't care what you call your economic system I wanted it with\nMy family has autonomy to worship as we want\nWhere my children can be safe at where the family is more important than anything else\nWe live in a system now where you know girls my three daughters are told royals keep your child to get their first obligation is to global capitalism and you have an awful it's virtually to work at some investment banker to raise your own children I mean maybe that's what you want okay fine\nBut we're telling our kids get their first obligation is to sort of shareholders and their own family\nIt it was an amazing who signed up for that Republicans defend it yeah I don't know why\nWell they're not thinking I have to say I mean I've talked about this but in the past but their their fundamental things that some of our leaders don't understand I remember you know George\nBush when we had an ounce of course I was a fan of Bush I voted for him but but the idea that we can wave a magic wand kill a dictator\nAnd you know Seventeen Seventy six style self government and democracy is going to pop up in Afghanistan and in Iraq and you think wait a second this is a fundamental misunderstanding of how things are supposed to work you need a people of virtue to govern themselves you need a whole history\nThe these kinds of things understanding what the free market is and what it is and why it's good and why it's not I really think our leaders we were so\nDumb [laughter] no it's true I Know he bought it like now\nWhen the non Arabic speaker like Bill Kristol tells you he knows exactly what's going to happen in the country has never been to you and doesn't understand yeah and we by which were not like oh that's right it's like ... it's like you know what's going to happen like life is so complex right every\nWar has we're still dealing with the outcome of the first World War are you joking I mean like this is ... whatever we were very unwise yeah into believing a lot of dumb people who pretended to know what they were talking about but had no idea\nI I mean I I I hate to agree I hate to agree and you're ... you're exactly right but listen uh we're coming to see these things now at least you are and I am and we can assume there's a couple of people out there who see these things\nAnd uh I really think that a lot of this has coalesced around the person the person in the presidency of Donald\nTrump and we're really are having a\nA realignment or a market correction of ideas as we're we're out of time I know you have to go maybe you can stay on the line I

I Hope that and it's why I wanted to have you want for this hour\nBut but tell us and in Salem um ... what are the basic give us a thumbnail sketch in case somebody just tuning in these have never heard of this [noise]\nCriminals who is going to get phantom I what I was ... go ahead and we will have their own\nBusiness and this is the parents are often or married or not he said if the driver I was just such there's a picture of a marriage it's like no you go darling no you go you go ahead and Kerman God who is\nUnemployed doctor who um is serving three like sentences and a principal in Pennsylvania for\nDelivering babies alive and then and then cutting her next which said there's a need for Thirty years with impunity\nBecause of its tablet shipments who you who who you know who wants to protect abortion that nothing about all the warning signs even though and in fact two women died and it's like and they still did nothing [noise] um so this is this ... this is the movie is actually about the trial\nInvestigation on the trial we showed up and gory it's not at all like that it's a lot like a law and order episode but but I think this is what ... ... am on a jury you know of pro pro abortion people actually over you know not pro life people convicted of murder for doing that and\nThat its own brings up a lot of questions about how did he get away with it for so long\nI fly would a governor governor Tom Ridge a Republican governor Catholics have allowed this to happen during his sharing his time as governor and in fact why was it that that same governor said hands off the abortion clinics which was part of the reasons like author Walter\nWatson discovered earlier um ... you know there's no question that the story brings up and not the least of which is how the media or the ... once the story did break and was in the court Philadelphia how it is that most people in the country have never heard of ...\nWell we're not coming in very divided times and this is this is a horror and I was if you want to know how divided they are\nA ... even when someone does a things as horrific as gruesome as this man did if it somehow falls under the rubric of of abortion nobody wants to know the facts and in this case\nUh because we do have laws in this country we were forced to deal with the facts and this man as you said it's not behind bars\nServing three life sentences I mean this is an amazing thing so what precisely was this butcher convicted of that he is now behind bars for three lifetimes if that were possible [noise]\nWell he's he's convicted of murder and murdering babies also killing his patient and you know he he run or a or something like that was a grand jury in Philadelphia and I'm sure a branch of the Philadelphia I've seen a lot they called it a ... of horrors\nI'm about to he was allowed to do this that the bodies were being ... to ... say the bodies were piling up but they actually were literally piling up in ah in his in his basement or ... dead weight in the coming out of a clinic\nOr the authorities didn't want to do anything and I you know we're ... we made a movie about it\nI Want to tell people look it's not it's not a gory it's not a horror movie it's a courtroom drama and it's about the trial it's about\nHow how you go from being this non being protected species or two detectives could detect isn't good lawyers realizing this sooner on Rikers something wrong here on fighting against the political backlash the media backlash to bring justice to let them as in boy so\nIf people want to know about the movie or just so ah 'cause people tune in and out of radio programs they can do to God's Nell movie dot com God's analogy o s N E L L gods now movie dot com\nUm ... what what made you think the two of you that a movie needed to be made about this he wrote a tremendous book about it I Know the book did very well and people are interested in the book uh I Would recommend highly or that they get a copy of the book for all the details movies can never give those kinds of details but\nUh what what persuaded you\nTo make a movie [noise] you know nothing succeeds like like a movie in in in reaching a very wide ordeal\nI'm you know not everyone read the books that are all the time but they don't they just don't like reading\nUm even documentaries are something that a lot of people you know don't really like to to watch and we actually thought you know what you know what's really popular with the current genre is very very popular in the United states but a lot of TV show with our our climate here for years with incredible crime story\nBut we have an ... am to ... you know it's true crime and at the central it is a very impressive investigation ... you know that's great I'm sad but\nYou know that's a made for a cop Jim lord of the central story and then you know followed up very closely by the attorneys to women really going to get a story and put this guy behind bars um you know it it got the you know that's that's very much that I very much the attraction\nAnd and failing did you direct this movie\nYou know what we were just as a mix seriously that veteran actor Nick seriously\nA directed at you know you probably know Mick from ah from justified the TV series but also Nick Nick was an actor and the shape of water he was also in three billboards outside ebbing Missouri just just a names and you know as a minute basically every movie you know every\nBig movie the last friday the post office and he said that's what he wants to do now and he ... he felt like this was something that he was he could do I'm really as it was designed for him so I have done a good\nJob um you know thank God I didn't direct it uh you know as a journalist I Would have been too concerned with you know making sure that the other thing is you know its toll exotic law you know but Nick Nick has thoughts\nKeys kept the story truth about his probably allowed to stay in the ... election 'til it I'm I'm told that were stolen and that's where I Am often we want this to be accessible to people I mean as you say that book was a best seller but you know that it's still a limited audience that was\nA true crime drama in America for a you know everyone watches out you know if you watch [noise] if you watch you know law and order you'll love this\nWell I was gonna say that uh you know to tell a story like this that it is a gruesome story but you don't need\nTo show the horror you can apply it and there have been many films a that have dealt with abortion in moral bleak way this is of course before roe v Wade the thing became hot button and movies don't touch it anymore\nBut there was a time when you could do that the movie ... with ah Michael Cain and Shelly winters brilliant movie from Nineteen sixty six\nUh it deals with an abortion and it was just one of those things I Will never forget it they don't show anything but it just conveys the horror when we come back talk some talking or to the authors of the book on ... ... now and now they're behind the movie God's nail movie dot com is the website stick around\nTo start [noise]\nImagine a politician saying this today\nI Am

snooping there next would scissors one of the most gruesome things imaginable but he seems to be very jolly and cheerful and I want a strange thing\nYeah and like you know I mean you know he's ... he's got that kind of electric ... you know type of personality she you know he smiles she has this very intellectual exploits very soft voice\nWhat Thirty years I mean basically Thirty years he was he he you know when he's operating within ... well you know at Seventeen of those years several\nTeen of those years no one expected the clinic no ones with the department of health decided to to to see you know to do that\nAnd that's interesting just what you were saying there Eric you know but people need to know what's going on in the country we one of the parts of the film that we you know what I'm most proud opened up and think it's really important that we and we certainly are very\nVery clear we wanted to have it in the screenplay was you know that during the actual trial of credit card bill you know to abortion doctors were brought in because they needed to explain\nTo the jury what a good portion good legal abortion laws so that they could distinguish between bass and murder 'em and I can tell you I I I've friends of mine who are medical who are in the medical profession that doctors who who come into that particular sex but the movie\nAs educational to them as alert they learn something they didn't know before one dear friend of mine is the next it's a very highly qualified to worked all over the United states of America get knocked no\nSo this is why exactly what you're saying young people get to go because they're going to get an education I mean other than if you're like law and order episode you have this you know or some doctor on the stand and\nCan you describe a legal abortion to the to the jury and I remember failed the night at the very beginning of this process that whatever happened that testimony will be in the movie in the movie script because very important to us because we believe\nNo one has ever done that before the movie I think it's a complete first\nAnd it's important to 'em and no one can criticize it because it's it's basically stole it from the actual transcript of the trial you know it wasn't you know what would you know rising there you know um and it was so important um to include that because\n... you know we don't have you where where else are you going to get that information it's such an unbiased and on you know on varnish way and I think it's ... it's quite shocking for people who hear it even people who think they know a good subject there'll be quite shocked to hear that's\nOne thing we probably haven't said because we know the subject so well and certainly both of you do but but what God's nails did that makes them a serial killer or it's not just of course that he's doing very late term abortions which are gruesome but\nUnfortunately quite legal in America but he was also because he made a lot of money off of ah killing children who were viable obviously and you describe a described that early on but but but these children would often be born\nAlive and he would he would murder them uh and and that is really why he is behind bars is it not\nYeah\nYeah I mean is he he he murdered babies born alive he he murdered his own patients by the way a by allowing on registered on qualified stop to get the ...\nAnd he also operated up go mow\nUm you know he he needs to be nice and just for selling opioids he also did it in in in the the the legal limit for abortion and in Pennsylvania is an incredible twenty four weeks an incredible twenty four weeks like you know six months she was six months pregnant ...\nHowever I wasn't good enough for him heated even earlier than ... er during the week and then on the week on a Sunday\nIt get abortions soul it that he didn't trust any of the other members of stuff to a system to him and his wife did what he called the special kids as if he was doing twenty four plus during the week what would you do in the weekends you know nine months and months nine months that's that's what he was on\nAny nobody would prosecute him he was ... quite confident that he could get away with this obviously with the with the with the liberal abortion climate in America and especially in Pennsylvania\nAnd he was right that's right because we knew and we knew he was right because we know despite multiple complaints and lots of lots of complaints and in fact they all you know the complaints came to light during the grand jury investigation you know despite\nAll of the matter how bad things got and obviously I mean it doesn't get much worse to women dying noticing what inspired the department of health and Pennsylvania to inspect ... and you know that's in children read quite people need to go and ... it's been happening tend to be any of this century not in some\nBackwater novel ... century now back in the dark ages

chaos and the political ... and so it's an honor to be with you ...\nWell that's their armed very touch because of who you are so thank you but I I Want to focus on you and your book and the news item that I just read about you and canvas Owens but first let me tell everybody she was written this book campus battlefield\nHow conservatives can win the battle on campus and why it matters so campus battlefield the bookers epidemic Prager dot com if anybody knows the campus battlefield is turning point you have people all over the country\nThat universities all over the country who are members of TPP will say I folks have spoken for his conventions are all around the country or will be at Newport Beach him knows who's this weekend\nAnd I was in Florida for you and you know I just want people to know I spoke ... was Washington DC 'cause I remember that the Donald Trump junior was with me a behind the scenes fair and a twenty five hundred students didn't do\nThat that's correct yeah you spoke to our high school audience and you spoke to us from Palm Beach and in fact you also a spoke at our trap through the University of Wyoming ah why social worker makes people selfish I was an excellent speech and\nI think our chapter Colorado State university is also hosting you are in the near future as well so uh\nI just want people to know how much we worked together it's it's it's a powerful thing and that's the reason I mentioned that but I just want people on the stand twenty five hundred students from around the country usually the cheap and that's a very big deal and I I just want to salute you for that\nAnd it is when you go to something like that my ... you get some optimism show you or your ... title of your book\nIs how conservatives can win\nThe battle on campus All right go ahead how can we were and why don't we wish him\nWell first of all the premise that I come forth in this book is one that you're talking about a lot which is where we believe we're in in our civil war and that's the culture war for the soul of this country and\nPolitics of Andrew Breitbart used to say first downstream from culture and the most in court vertical and culture is our universities [noise] um they are they're filled with ...\nProfessor relief but as you always kind of like say Dennis ... not very much wisdom that goes on there and what would I have found by touring these campuses speaking at you know over a hundred\nA year and now having an organization that spans Thirteen hundred a gram across the country is that it's not that students are opposed the conservative ideas\nIf they're not exposed them at all the first place bravo and so and and the ... books that are put together in this book or factually ... and it it made it through some ways it increasing ocean but we have to show up\nIt's remarkable to me how many students are searching for this message they have a desire to hear a different viewpoint and for whatever reason the universities have silence tremendous quite simple\nMy conclusion that comes through is they hate the idea that there are other ideas are black not liberal there's very few liberal out there and more of a ...\n... they are focused on silencing any opinion that might ... model Rick Rick I'm\nControl over the intellectual an ideological um viewpoint other generation and so just just yesterday I spoke in South Florida we packed a room with eight hundred students day before that we have two thousand students at the University of Georgia\nWait a minute wait whoa that's a big deal it really\nOr your weight you ... you were you when campus or just you got\nYour candidate selling myself to shoot the real draw so I kind of just\nGo oh you're just humble guy okay I mean you're both girls but it but that that's very significant to south I forgive me I Want to underscore what you should be very briefly the issue my dear dear listeners is they have never heard our shied\nIt is not so much that they are from the left you just that they have no idea that there was a non molest way of approaching life\nThat's exactly right\nAnd what what I find that the work that pregnant university does and what we're doing on the ground\nIs that when students are presented these arguments and lots of cold fact director um non feeling sense if you will because every ... hours is rooted in the ocean\nAnd it's rooted in Queens and as you've caught so many millions of people Dennis very few people care about how you feel we care about how you act and even more importantly what you think and why you think about what you do and so we have found is that\nStudents that have any sort of ambition students that have any sort of sense of human decency or wants to do something in their lives\nOn there's no way they can find the ... ...\nBecause the left is all about tribal identity politics it is about you can never you can never improve yourself you have to blame the external for any sort of suffering that you might being being experiencing source student that might have what some would say classical\nLiberals ears on gay marriage or abortion they're leaving the last in record numbers because if they didn't believe in some stepped on so free enterprise\nOr they think that black only dormitories or a bad idea then all of a sudden you're considered to be a right wing or art ... at the at the university and so the second part that I highlight in this book is how radical the universities have become\nAnd it it important for your listeners to understand the Democrat Party the sixties and seventies but JFK type Democrats those are considered to be fringe right wing radicals dial on college campuses have you believe that there are two genders you if you believe in free enterprise\nSystem if you believe America is the greatest country average like that those are considered fringe ideology and because of that you know the left as some ways doing us a favor it allows us to recruit decent minded students that quite frankly say there's no way I Want to\nBelieve invest cultural Marxist world view that as being shoved down my throat by my professors um and then the third point I make in the book which is really really important is how the conservative business community has subsidized that's who they are getting over the last couple of decades um\nIt is amazing to me he goes you walk you walk the halls of Harvard or Yale or Princeton\nA majority of the big gift that are given at these universities or the worst indoctrination occurs is thanks to the giving of conservatives successful business people that have allowed the Marxist to have unlimited amount of funds to indoctrinate\nGeneration after generation and so it's really a call to action to parents and two alumni stopped giving money to university not give it to ... university that the different things to stop giving money your actual school you went to first of all they don't need it\nSecond off they're going to use your money to go against your values so program a generation to hate America and that that really needs to be reinforced that goes through all this ... levels are given how universities corrupt the ah the ... process and how they deceived\nInto thinking of going forward the targeted\nOn initiative or program when in reality it goes for all the cultural studies or feminist studies and allows these professors to continue their um\nThey are ... book the book folks again this campus battlefield Charlie Kirk founder and president of turning point usa the book is up but then it's pretty good outcome would you please tell my audience what has happened with DePaul University\nYeah I mean DePaul University which is a private school in Chicago\nUm has allowed I just
