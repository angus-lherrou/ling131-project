as we've been talking about Ford feels like months [noise]\nMan I Hope that this is over or by this time next week and we can all agree on that can't we and we can probably all agree on this is while the battles low\nAgainst those who when would restrict our religious freedom or that battles are not going to be over next week that battles not going to be over next month or next year that battle goes on in that battle goes on\nI'm twenty four seven and I want you to hear me nobody in the country is on the front lines\nAre more than my good friends at alliance defending freedom nobody on the front lines more defending our religious freedom then alliance defending freedom from the court house all the way to the Supreme Court abs\nFights the good fight as ATF senior counsel David Cortland tells us\nIts growth has been fantastic its effect on the culture has been fantastic\nAnd again as you mentioned um ADS win rate is unmatched unparalleled a it's a Supreme Court player or were successful there nine victories over the last eight or nine years and got his good um our our team is fantastic out as good and the people who support us have a passion for what we do believe in what we do and right now\nI Am here Eric great to talk to you know it's so good to have you on I Wish I could talk to you about something more fun but you know what\nIf we're talking about something that's important that's even more important than just having fun so let's get into it there is so much going on in our country we need wisdom what are we to make of the current situation what do you what do you have to say\nWell apart from being a gas and appalled and horrified Eric I Can't say that I'm particularly surprised yeah on if you take a step back from the media the ethic Kavanaugh\nDebacle uh at the hands of the Democrats if you try to look at this from eight thirty thousand foot vantage point it all makes complete sense because the Democrats look\nThe left has been at war with the constitution the country free market economics individual liberty from essentially they're from the beginning of the republic but certainly over the last century or so the progressive movement has shot to\nIn the words that President Obama fundamentally transform the nation and what about the men by God it's within the left means by that more broadly which is\nChange the United states away from the foundational principles that made a great individual liberty I economic freedoms John national security rule of law move the country away from those killers and toured a collective state ... state socialist economic a commanding\nTroll from Washington and so on [noise] they have been on a war to affected that change for decades now\nSo they have they have met with resistance by the American people who are essentially center right people throughout this entire war that they've been waging so because they haven't been able to achieve a lot of those goals by the ballot box\nBecause the American people see it for what it is and rejected they have used the courts\nParticularly the Supreme Court but the court said all level to impose their ideas and their agenda because they couldn't do it legislatively so when you take a step back and you look at the confirmation fights over Clarence Thomas for example Robert Bork were they were successful\nAnd torpedo wing candidate fee for that nomination right and now with Kavanaugh who\nWill replace the swing vote Anthony Kennedy it makes complete sense that the left would take this approach to destroy the man his career his reputation his good name his family because for them it it's not personal for them it is all about\nPower and control and if you dare to step in their way of achieving that power and control a few threatened to block their forward march in any way Eric you must be destroyed\nStill not should come as a surprise I mean I think all decent people of goodwill are outraged at what about what is happening to this good man but when you take a step back and look at it and the broader sweep of history it makes perfect sense\nWell I I agree and I guess what I'm Wondering is right now in America [noise] when people you know that I think the thing that that um [noise]\nIt's not just the left it's it's the enemies of all of it as good in true and beautiful they exploit a the innocence where the kindness or the graciousness of the other side Hitler did it uh in spades I mean people were to buttoned up to understand they're dealing with a madman until it was too late\nOr you see sometimes um you know the Bush a forty one and to some extent Bush forty three there there's somehow gentlemanly and they allowed themselves to be ruled and played\nBy the other side often and it seems to me right now you have something like that going on in other words the viciousness on the other side people aren't really\nThey're not prepared to accept the absolute willingness on the other side to do anything to win including put someone forward\nWho has so far nothing\nPlausible to say in other words ... this woman I'm Ford\nWho is she you know anybody can say anything but they're willing to put somebody forward like that even without corroborating evidence just because\nThey think it's going to work they think that if they do this they rattle the cage long enough eventually somebody will given isn't that what what what the Senator Flake just did in other words if you screaming loud enough in the elevator he doesn't have the guts to say excuse me\nI'm trying to take an elevator if you don't mind you know he wouldn't say that so he left this woman rented him in the next thing you know we have another week of of lunacy it's because the other side has\nHas taken off the gloves but I guess my point is\nI think your average American eventually does see this and I think that your average American at this point is seeing the craziness that that this has gone so far and it really does become a kind of madness that's taking a silver\nYeah and I look I I think you have to take\nInto consideration to the the the allegations the person making the allegations whether there's cooperation or substantiate should we haven't gotten any of that\nFrom the ... frankly any other accuser of judge Kavanaugh and also to your point about the American people and what they see and somebody came forward and said I Know that judge Kavanaugh I drove a car off of a bridge or\n... oh since I ah Massachusetts island and round a girl\nAnd here's the body and here's what we know and here's how he left the scene and passed down for ten hours before he chose to report the accident and hear the police reports and so on people would say holy cow\nHoly cow he is being accused of murdering someone there are police records medical records proof witnesses eyewitness accounts and so on and this is a heinous crime it's murder\nBut what they're saying is they're they're trying to ... because this woman story is not holding up and it's full of holes and inconsistencies no going back to his high school yearbook and and trees in that and whether or not he had an extra beer or two in high school or college\nMost Americans take a look at that and say you know\nWhat if an extra beer or two in high school and college is his biggest\nCrime or I could never make it to the Supreme Court I mean people are people know that life\nIs full of shades of gray and we none of us are perfect the last perfect person to walk the earth with Jesus Christ none of us are perfect and people are saying we only you're going to try to block this guy for something he may or may not have done in high school when he was Seventeen or sixteen\nYears old it is mad as hell and I think that when you're looking at a lot of the\nPolling and and it's very fluid now Eric but what I see is yeah both sides are are now jazzed\nGoing into the terms because of this onslaught against Kavanaugh but what's more interesting to me is that it seems that the Republicans now the Republican base conservatives even independents\nWho are watching the spectacle and it's grotesque hit job on this very good and accomplish mad they are now completely jazzed to come out and vote that's my that's my hang on\nA modicum forgive me you're going to go to a break we're going to come back talk talking to Monica crowd

very very heartening uh\nTo see someone who I don't think of his particularly a conservative Lindsey Graham\nAh finally say I've had enough I think that there are people like that who don't fear speaking emotionally there there are many who who do and I I think that they have been so careful that they've allowed this to happen they allow people like Dianne Feinstein and Cory Booker and\nKamala Harris and others to take advantage of their graciousness you know 'cause they act like well the Senate as a club and we have to you know when you realize that\nSome of the people in that room they don't really believe in anything you just said it before you're referring to Ted Kennedy I mean the idea Ted Kennedy was a swine he was a swine Nash man threw out his life often extremely drunk\nTouching women having all kinds of I mean just such a mess he was a Senate tore for decades and he was lying eyes by the left when he passed and I think to myself\nThis is the ... this is a vintage double standard and I unless you talk about it but people forget people forget that you have people like that\nThat we're we're lying eyes by the leftist champ yeah women in\nMy column tomorrow in that held talks exactly about the Kennedy example in particular\nBut remember and guys like Kennedy and Bill Clinton because they were on this so called the right side of the issues

on the quote unquote wrong side of the issues most importantly abortion and she does not have the protection of the press\nSo he is being destroyed well guys like Bill Clinton credibly accused of rape and Ted Kennedy literally killed a woman I went on to to be celebrated and continue to be revered\nWell we're living in very very strange times the bill Clinton stuff is probably the strangest of all this man was accused by when either Broderick very clearly clearly\nA did something horrific probably raped her we don't hear ... about it from the other side folks when we come back we're going to

with you the most exciting thing about you for me uh is not just that you are you're right thinking politically or\nBut um you worked for Richard Nixon and knew Richard Nixon toward the end of his life I just strikes me as an extraordinary privilege that you had\nTo get to do that and so therefore I guess I Want to ask you what do you think a President Nixon would make of where we are now but if things were very divided in this country when he was the president but\nIt seems to me that now it's simply worse\nYes and I'm Glad you asked me that question\nEric because later in the week I'm going to have another call and for spectator usa the British I excuse me the American edition of the British spectator on since thoughts on the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill\nA spectacle because I was working with him at that time and I think it's important to revisit Nixon's insights into what went down during that period of time because it is so what is an end to the Kavanaugh experience what we're going through today but I Would take to answer your broader point\nOn\nIt then the moment that we are currently in I I'm not so sure that we've seen since the Vietnam Era\nAnd then before that the civil war period\nIn this country history I think it's really unhealthy I think it's very dangerous and I think that the difference this time around which makes it even more so than the previous two periods I mean obviously the civil war to the very existence of the country but it's at stake\nYou at the huge moral issues of slavery and abolition and so on\nThe period of the Vietnam Era also was carrying a country apart over the war and and the counter culture and so on\nSo these are all true the greed of people but I think what makes\nThis particular moment perhaps the most dangerous is that the other side again at war with the constitution at war with free market economics individual liberty all the great American pillars of exceptionalism\nThat they are so willing to buck the constitution and it's very\nUh foundations of what makes this country what it is including basic rule of law principles like due process I mean the left has always been so\nOutspoken and so adamant about transparency accountability due process you've got the ACLU\nWill now over the last like two days or so the ACLU has come out\nSaying well Kavanaugh should not a gift to the Supreme Court well\nWhat about evidence ... and the injury rules and requirements what about due process what about the presumption of innocence until proven guilty all of the things that the left the ACLU and said that they stood for forever the idea that they would be so willing to dispense\nAre allowing to all of this to get in the way he was on sixty minutes last night with a Democrat Chris Coons oh we've forged this bipartisan compromise to allow the FBI to look at this for a week do you think the last few think Coons do you think Feinstein and and the far left\nThat they look at this as oh this was so great a bipartisan compromise this is just yet another delay tactic they want to push this\nPast November and that vote to see if they'll have more leverage to stop this seat from ever being filled until the twenty twenty election right\nI mean that that's obvious and that's the question is do people on the geo piece I Know is there anybody there\nWho gets it I Wonder ah what the president's role has been if he's had a role behind the scenes or if he feels he has to be very very careful but I I the president has always gotten this stuff he somebody who is you know kind of a warrior at heart sometimes to a fault but I really do think that Americans\nWho are inclined toward traditional values are toward a um\nTowards voting a more conservatively I think a lot of them the reason they voted for Trump and the reason they're probably upset with the Senate now is because of this I think what is wrong with these people are playing Patty cake with the devil Dianne Feinstein is so\nCynical her legacy will be how she cynically played this this was at the end of her career it is so ugly so negatively political it's depressing\nYou know over the weekend irregardless watching MSNBC and little bit CNN a little bit the bill Maher show on HBO little bit and I literally\nHad to turn it off because I felt literal Natasha because these people are so cruel and they're still vicious and they're so ruthless and the pathological liar is\nWrong with that because we know we know that we're not the judge\n... the ease with which they will mock and disregard and tear apart a good and decent man like Brett Kavanaugh over politics over their war for the future of the country the viciousness and cruelty that I saw I literally had to turn it off and get away from that yeah because\nI felt it on his spiritual level and you live talked about this we've talked about our our beliefs and and our faith then Jesus and everything I look at these battles took down there the sort of a natural level and the political level and so on obviously it is\nBut I also see a spiritual level to this is a spiritual warfare this is good versus evil\nAnd it's so clear to I think you and me and and maybe not to some others\nBut the weapons that are used are so outrageous inhumane that I think most of the American people even if they don't see sort of a spiritual\nDimension to this I think they feel it and see it on some level\nYou listen you you could not be more right at\nHeart this is a spiritual battle and at heart all real battles or spiritual battles but this is\nClear that the the lines are becoming clearer uh the the the evil or when people can ... a good man like this and treat him as though he is guilty and you start realizing something's wrong with those people because\nEven if you thought he might be guilty you still believe in fairness you still believe we've got to go according to procedure\nIt's clear the people they don't care they just want to win and it's it's very very ugly and I I think that um that I didn't think I Would uh you know go go there but I wanted to mention that the Kanye West thing I don't know if you saw clips of him on Saturday Night live but I thought\nI never thought I Would consider him a hero in a brave man\nFor him being willing to uh to speak out against this bullying as he put it that's exactly I mean if if the if the Senate or\nA Judiciary Committee and had had half the ... the he had they wouldn't be putting up with this nonsense I just have to say I maybe when we come back we can talk about that because I just I don't know did you see it\nWho who would've thought Kanye West would emerge as a hero of the Republican\n[laughter] I mean can you imagine I mean is it ... I've been\nReading about this all day yesterday and saying you know let's let's back up Kanye West and let him know he's not Standing Alone that we've got is back he said he wanted to put the mega\nHat on on air and all and they were bowling backstage\nAnd not to do of course they were because they are scared to death if somebody like Kanye West comes out for Trump they're just going to melt like the wicked witch they cannot handle that it's so scary when we come back we're going to talk more with Monica Crowley is the ... taxes show stick around folks\n\nDaughter was

see this is a brave man to be willing to go out on the stage of SNL to defend Trump to defend his wearing this hat\nThat is just it's just stunning to me that he's willing to do that and all the

we saw was the the equivalent of a show trial\nWhere I'm from the people in charge of the show trial trying to destroy someone's good name destroy him politically and destroy us politically\nOr they

for all your welcome\nAlso any way that the thing is ... let me just say this um we are unfortunately at war we yeah we were playing Patty cake we're playing nice and I really think that if Kavanaugh had been\nAble to be voted on before the flake flake out\nUh I think\nWe could have proceeded and the the the bitter left would have continued to snap and growls\nBut we could have moved on with some semblance of order with this having happen now with this call for this FBI investigation I think the gloves are now off on both sides I think that you know they\nTell you what it's about it's not it's not just about Kavanaugh it's not just about the Supreme Court it's not even just about roe versus Wade which we don't know how the voter ditches about destroying Trump's presidency I was on the phone this morning with some very serious people who who used to work in the ministry and\nAnd it says about stopping ... Kavanaugh\nPreventing Trump from from getting a nominee on the court getting the base of the Republican base so dispirited so defeated so humiliated that we don't just lose the house of representatives\nAnd Trump gets impeach which is like an indictment the Democrats now think they can win the Senate and remove him from office that is how lives up\nThis pack of sharks are because they taste blood in the water so really that's what this is about this is all about taking down President Trump it's I mean each Brett Kavanaugh is a nice guy who was friends with the Bush family he's the kind of establishment Republican I Would probably normally avoid like the plague\nBut I'm sure he'd be a very good jurors none of that matters nothing about his character matters now people are saying he's guilty of perjury we can't prove that he molested Dr Ford with can't prove he ever met her\nIt doesn't matter doesn't matter the inconsistencies in our story which she told under oath none of that matters what\nMatters is maybe we can catch him in in an exaggeration or a slight inadvertent misstatement of facts concerning his college drinking habits\nOh I just want to be clear people are saying he committed perjury because he didn't night that he drank too much that he didn't he spent he said quite specifically\nI never drank so much that I blacked out or had time or I didn't remember what I had done that is all he said under oath anything else you hear people talking about I wouldn't call it spin out would call it a why\nI Would call it leibel and character assassination and anyone who says otherwise you all he lied about drinking no he didn't you you'll line up perjury what is your character problem\nIt's the you know it's an amazing thing because even imagine I mean even just step back and imagine what we're talking about we're talking about a kid in high school and the first year of college I remember you when you were Eighteen while\nWe were kids in those days right when you're on a pretty sight you're a kid but I mean it's hilarious because I remember you\nAt age Eighteen I remember myself at that first of all it's forty billion years ago let's let's be clear okay this is not something that happened in Nineteen Ninety nine a this is ages in ages ago\nAnd the drinking age was Eighteen at the\nTime was was Eighteen and I drink to excess every single weekend because that's what you did on those campuses and yeah and I have\nI Would have five gin and tonics for dinner\nAnd it didn't mess or foreign them for [laughter]\nA lot to a bar [laughter] I'd be fine well\nBut the ... listen I can just say this for a fact right in my life I look back on\nNow what I Want my daughter or my nieces and nephews to drink that much rain like that absolutely not I had a born again experience in my mid twenties and I'm a I'm a different man I can say that and I and I never drink to excess but in those days\nDrinking to excess never got to the point\nWhere you're blacking out or you can't remember never and I think to myself if somebody drink to that level you would say you've got a problem like you can't drink that much that\nThey would not graduate near the top of their class at Yale and and get into Yale Law school people like that I knew people like that yeah they tended to drop out then dry off and come dry out and come back by Google solar silver in in in every sense\nWell I mean that's the that's the point is if you've got that kind of a drinking problem where you're actually literally blacking out you're not going to be able to function at ... ... if I mean if you can function of places like yelling won't be at a high level\nAnd so we have to I mean the fact we have to have the silly conversation but just to so people understand\nUh we're talking about something that happened a million years ago for for for starters then we're talking about the whole thing is sort of degrading but we have to have the conversation anyway we're going to be right back folks I have the great joy of speaking to ...

you you probably are wondering is there any place in America that teaches young adults college students to seek what is true beautiful and good\nOr to even understand what those things I mean if you ask me that's actually one of the ... education is supposed to be ... and how 'bout to teaching young people to understand the principle that all men are created equal or why America is the world's freest nation\nThese are all true things it's important that we understand them and there is only one place I can think of where students study these things at the level they do in Hillsdale College and that is Hillsdale College\nUh by putting in the work to understand these essential cruise students from Hillsdale graduate ready to lead in any field they're choosing he'll still students learn and what it means to be a good citizen imagine that\nAnd actually you can learn what it means to be a good citizen too because he'll deal offers a stellar education to you\nListeners to this program through the free monthly subscription to him prime is and it's free online courses like constitution one on one every American can learn like a Hillsdale student from the same professors which I just find it amazing so\nMost remarkably of all let me say that he'll feel provides disservice to our nation without taking a penny of taxpayer money not a penny\nI encourage you to learn how Hillsdale conserve view at our website created just remind listeners which would be you it's Mitt taxes for Hillsdale dot com that's my taxes for Hillsdale dot com and joins me Iraq let's continue our conversation about\nThe Kavanaugh hearings All right thanks so try when you see a show trial right road is the fundamental difference between\nA showed her show trial with in a show trial legal norms of guilt and innocence and the presumption of innocence do not apply\nBecause you are not being judged as to whether or not we can prove you did something criminal you are being grilled for your political acceptability and\nAnd for how well you'll have sat followed the party line the shifting party line that dominates society so\nFor instance in the Soviet Union\nWhen he when Stalin had show trials of his former colleagues who had helped\nDo a ... bring about the Russian Revolution some of them did a lot more for an ad on\nHe one of the things that was the first of all they manufactured all sorts of crazy allegations like they they asserted that some of these longtime bolstered exports simultaneously spies for England Nazi Germany and the Vatican\nAt the same time that they were sabotaging factories that they were poisoning the water\nAnd then but what was really about was that their views about how communism should be implemented or not what style and wants to do at the moment so be cause they disagreed with him and say how to collective eyes the farms\nThey were criminals trying to destroy society and they needed to be destroyed and ... they were going to be badgered with new and more and other false charges until I confessed\nAnd you know ... ... maybe that's a motivation she wants to eat the Boston Legal maybe she worked for an abortion company let's\nGet a caller to pick her views on Kavanaugh and we can use the details from the memoir to build a plausible story that will check out in certain the particulars because we took them\nDirectly from our judges ... men watch and let's make ... mark judge is still fall guy because he admits in the memoir that he he got drunk and blacked out there she has memory lapses so he can't say it didn't happen because he's already admitted he has no credibility as a witness that's why he didn't wanna testify\nBefore the Senate because he would just go there and get\nBadgered by liars like Senator Blumenthal who pretended to fought in Vietnam\nAnd now that's not a joke I mean the idea that you know the details on on Blumenthal in the Vietnam claims\nYeah he got as many ... trap deferments as she could finally could devoted anymore and the poll whatever strangely he could to get a U.S assignment he never left us soil during the Vietnam War but he talked\nHe won he more the ones gave a speech where he talked about when we were fighting in Vietnam so he's a stone cold last year and if he were to say\n... under oath that he fought in Vietnam he could go to prison for perjury this is the man who are willing Brett Kavanaugh about the meaning of boom in your book\nWell actually in Wyoming and if\nYou're willing to lie in small things you're willing to lie in greater things I Wish to God Kavanaugh had said oh you mean like lying about serving in Vietnam the way you did senator that would have been great\nNow I guess I'm not clear did did Blumenthal ... did he said in a collective way when we Americans we're fighting in Vietnam another with no\nNo he said no no he was talking I think he's talking about soldiers he said you know when we were serving in Vietnam you know it was a it was in the context of fighting himself in Vietnam\nWell that's how I thought I just want to be clear but yeah yeah so we have a situation where\nUm the people are in in the Senate on the left side of things we have obviously Feinstein and and and White House and and all of these folks they seem to be\nI mean it's kind of obvious but I just want to say it that they really\nJust want to win so what Feinstein did the plausible deniability and we didn't leak this thing or whatever it it seems clear I think the most Americans who are paying attention to this that if she really cared about this they would have brought it out\nOver two months ago but they knew that politically it would be far more damaging to do right during the hearings and so they sprung it on America and then this woman of course is forced to come out of hiding and and uh you know become\nAnd you know she seems like a very fragile person I I ... I Can't help but think that she's damaged in some way that something horrible happened in her past and I couldn't help but feeling sorry for her because she seems like a very\nUh as I put in a very fragile person he I still can't I I Wonder if the truth will ever come out uh why she's doing this and what she really believes I don't know that we'll ever get that\nYeah I I don't think it would be very convenient for them if it did come out well I\nI think she was going to be a second I think there is not just know reasonably with Kevin all their strong reason to\nBelieve it was not Kavanaugh um the fact that\nAll of this was handled by her George Soros attorney and I'm not using that lightly hurt or turning this cat's has worked for Fifteen Years for George Soros directly wow\nThis is ugly business so ugly I Hope\nMost people in America are paying attention this is this is not GOP versus Democrats this is really for the soul of this country there there are many good people are in America who who would have voted\nI'm against the GOP in previous elections but I Am I Am hoping\nThat there is some real liberals out there who understand that the things that have held us together as a nation or being threatened by people who are so desperate for power they simply don't care anymore they simply don't there's not that they care in a long time but\nBut they're revealing themselves to be willing to go to extremes that we have not seen in our public life this is very very destructive to the foundations of this country I I I just want to\nUh we're gonna have to go to another break here folks I'm Talking to Jon ... let me remind you we're doing a uh trying to raise money for alliance defending freedom they defend people in these kinds of situations all the time

Carrick who molest molested at least one teenage boy we baptized as an infant and sexually harassed and said do seminarians for decades and\nWhatnot finally came out in the public press they had to remove them as a cardinal but he's still in our ... and he's still living very comfortably at the churches expense he has attention he has health care H.

else I peered besides filling in for Dennis and Laurie\nIn this hour you can continue to call but I thought I Would have some political experts on to give us their take on where this is all going and what it means for the upcoming elections as well as for the future of the republic\nThere Sean steel Republican committee men from the former great state of California you can't say that but I can and artist Steinberg political consulting pollster and writer of whiplash from JFK to Donald Trump a political odyssey will gentlemen I don't even know where to begin the callers are still there but\nTo the parents have been accused of surprise you even in the first place ...\nYou know if I if there were the vast right wing conspiracy which I was the head when she came forward to\nThat she would have been ... dismissed it but of course it would have been pre supposing with the Democrats were also liberals like Alan Dershowitz offensively would have said\nLook if I were Dianne Feinstein and she weren't interested in the blood sport of gutting this nominee or ... or mid eighties is her final swan song there when this letter came to me or the staff would have looked interview per say look if you want to be anonymous and there isn't any cooperation there is a long time ago this doesn't\nCome across the threshold for me to pursue and I wouldn't be the end of it\nAnd aren't speaking of Dianne Feinstein center if I did you I don't know if you heard me suggests that Republicans and you're the national committee men for public after Republican Party in California that maybe we should vote for her opponent so there's some consequences for what she's doing what she did\nThe top two primary system is another unique the listeners should know that another disaster shining age or a California that you're allowed to vote for two people doesn't matter\nOnly two people ah who get the highest number of votes regardless of party affiliation we have no primaries anymore minor parties have disappeared in California so not consequently we get one crazy Democrat too far left wing cook Democrat\nAs our only choices for US Senate we can't even writing and that's a terrible idea Democrat activists say the Republican activists have at certain risk abolition folks love it and it and so what we have is a dying Feinstein or as a as a left wing opponent and Sean still not going to vote for either one I Can't even right in\nWhat about what about mark suggested ... here people are so upset I tell you this idea of felt like going to measure fights on campaign Bill Carrick or you know for many years and say you know\nWhat you're going to have those is the average Republican voter the average Republican vote that's what we should just get it doesn't know the Kevin de Leon her opponent is more left wing than she is ... they're going to viscerally react against Feinstein by voting for the other Democrat\nBut you do for your people national listening to the show they say California's a wave of the future the where what this is is that when there was a so called primary the top two vote getters go into the general election matter what so if the Democrats are strategizing and take over your steak when November comes you have a choice between bad in worse\nNow that's what it is that's why I said it's ... it's not only my idea of other people to suggest that if I think we should vote for her opponent and maybe she won't win\nRight if you want to be Catholic or do you say okay if she gets re elected as you did or eighties she's getting less less energy I just watched the way she walks to the podium to talk to Senator Grassley their\nGroups Elvis not super high energy there as you get cavity low and he's a younger person needs to be around for years so he won't have seniority that she'll have but he'll be a threat to us in a while I posted this on Facebook people are upset with me and they did say what\nWas ... that are dying find since she was like more or less the kind of a semi acceptable Democrat because she wasn't as crazy as as as her colleagues\nBut now she joined that that that group and now we're back to the Salem witch trials Salem witch trials or don't relationship disabled broad right I was gonna say yeah exactly but this is an Salem, Massachusetts a sixty Ninety two they can you know there were ... there's a hysterical people that were making crazy accusations against a a number of women there were hung\nA and they were accused of being witches and it wasn't even against what they did but it was it was their ghost that did ...\nFull disclosure is I knew Shaun steel when he was in high school ...\nYou know let let that go I don't want to hear any more about that I Will do want to ask you though once you credible some listener picked on me saying all your talk shows are saying she had some measure credibility\n... she was extremely well prepared she's a psychologist she's done to show her whole life she's been practicing this role for for many years to come she had a group of very smart media savvy lawyers\nAnd no she wasn't I thought she gave a good story and that was effective but it was a great presentation but when you dig into and you see that nothing about her story her life story makes any sense at all but\nYou say that and I agree with you but are Republicans they didn't say she wasn't credible and one of your callers I think the key points we always start out by giving her credibility there\nWell you know because we want to be courteous ... not to be angry against women and and the ... and possibly somebody who was actually had this experience pitch you got the wrong guy and she probably knows in her mind and her heart of hearts that she got the wrong guy but she's ... she's a tool\nOften but you know it's like our our behind they leak the fact we are going to have a women or a woman\nA question Kirk because we don't want these Republican mail is such a self defeat your consult right so is that in a smart move will look no no certainly not terrible for the first of all it was a good move that to have these senators not grandstanding looks you know ed Royce when he chaired the foreign affairs committee they hit it and ...\nAnd ... and I looked and it was awful but it wasn't that he's competing but every house member wanted to have their day in the Sunday or their Fifteen minutes of fame so there was no choreography no strategy no coordination\nSo they were wary of that I get that but why should I have to read the New York times or Washington Post is going to be a Republican tactics\nSecondly they never should have done the traditional thing of alternating Democrat Republican and giving a process I Know she data Saudi every time a souvenir she was confident I mean I've been crossed with them if you have all men to want to keep going so he do we have lawyers on our site as their US Senators who\nAre so and after that they agreed to this format rather say look all your Democrats could go through August up there when you're done we're going to have our personal question or\nThey should have had you there was a ... ... again the Republicans were in a bind there they're looking at all the stats and appalled and women are angry and they've been walking away a as a sizable number maybe ten twenty percent of women are walking away voting against Republicans because they think Republicans are bought\nIn ... in this hearing ... I'm going to say something a little bit uniquely ... I like what Chuck Grassley is generally done\nHe's kept telling me you know nice he's kept a tough schedule and look he's got a real problem at you and I don't have\nTo face in daily life he has to get eleven boast about Twenty one person committee no easy task and like ... so the whole hearing loss for one person in the universe was for Jeff Flake ... got his hearing any voted out as I told you earlier this year and it was just like name before he changed it I you know what I think it was born that way it's sad to say\nNow Jeff weasel yeah and then he changed thought it was but unless you're a lucky we got a vote I got to tell you something I'm grateful for that now\nFlights got another week going on with us I think it's actually good and I'm going to tell you my cold calculating political reason yes making my team very angry fired up their team's been angry and fired up for two years now it's about time our team wakes up understand smell the roses we have a nasty enemy here\nThey're about they're trying to take over the house representatives\nAnd if you think it's bad today wait till you see Maxine Waters in charge of a major committee that's really going to put us over the\nTop ... it's very scary as you were to look if the Democrats take control it who would share the the major companies in the house it's it's a rogues gallery of I mean you when you see people who are going to be an arm sure if they couldn't get a security clearance that there are people going to be having oversight or the CIA for software so the\nMessage clearly it's as I said you got to you know be enthused enough to go out there and vote and get everybody\nKnow you look at the at the at the national strategy 'cause we have a national leadership there the Democrats are counting on for example getting a few seats you in California like let's say ...\nAnd you talk to conservatives in Washington\nThey're not yet energized they don't realize that this is a battle out here they just look at Republican registration so if you live in orange county right that you got to come out for dinner or if they have now she asked national implications of fuel how few how she can do is make the different antics Los ... ... and I think average voters don't understand what it means when one party controls that chamber the\nSenate or the house their feet means that they control the committees\nThat it it is Maxine Waters there it to be full time of peace with twenty flat\nOut not only that Orange County as the pathway for Nancy Pelosi we've got four seats at risk we got great candidates oddly enough of the four seats we got three women running the Democrats are three guys running\nSo so that that still in other words we're we're we got the right demographics you've got the right approach or getting out spent two to one six to one and some of these races we need a muscle up and get curious and show up like the Tea Party get in two thousand and ten\nSo that's the
