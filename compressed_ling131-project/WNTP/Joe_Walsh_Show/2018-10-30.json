killed\nSix people injured dozens this guy was sentenced for decades in prison built a sorry block Obama set him free\nAnd then if we're going to talk about radical extremism block Obama never dark and the dog or a church until he came across the trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago which was a Marxist church at it by Jeremiah Wright right\nHe preached black liberation theology which is which is like communist liberation theology Latin America except that focuses on race war instead of class war that's where Obama went to church for years Jeremiah Wright married\nThe Obamas and baptized their daughters it is only ... good morning America air to clip of Jeremiah Wright ... yelling God damn America that only then did Obama rule actively distance himself from my man I Love what Jeremiah Wright said about it\nHe said that he chose aren't going to let him talk to me I told my baby daughter that he'll talk to me in five years but he's a lame duck or an eight years when he's out of office so far up Obama's spiritual mentor\nWas an anti Semitic Marxist his political mentor was a weather underground terrorist any set a Puerto Rican nationalism murderer and terrorists free from prison\nNow you why didn't we hear about that well\nI Am this gets to the to the heart of the matter is that the reason Trump was elected and the reason\nThe GOP will probably prevail in the midterms if everyone votes\nIs because I think that finally in America there's an anger\nAt the mainstream media people realize that for decades or the truth has been kept from them and and I think it's been a building thing but when stuff like this comes out and you see the way it's reported its grievous than in the United states of America\nA mainstream news organizations don't even try to split the difference they go all in on condemning the president as somehow guilty this I mean the fact that here's some powers ah whom I consider a friend and a sister in Christ\nWould say something that incendiary is baffling to me I must say it is baffling to me Jonathan Merritt also tweeting something along those lines it's baffling to me that they would would ratchet up the rhetoric to that

plays chief green on the radio literally nobody uh accept us with your contacts uh show John's miracle we're talking about the horrific events of the last a week\nI was saying when it comes to killing Jews there is nothing clear to me there's no clear expression of satanic evil than a murderous hatred of Jews we see it over and over and over again we saw it in the Soviet Union we saw it in the enemies of the Soviet Union the national\nSocialist a national socialist Germans under Hitler we see it in black\nNationalist we see it in white area and nationalist we hit in Muslims are who are radical we see this everywhere and they all unite and a hatred of the Jews I Want to be really clear that at the heart of this\nIs nothing less than the person\nUh the percentage of evil Satan is behind this and so I just want to tell people if you want to know um what's at the root of something like this you can trace it through history\nOr is it is profound evil and it just happened the other day absolutely horrific that in Pennsylvania and the United states of America or something like this could happen at least in my\nIn my personal experience I buy will run into some of these these horrible fascist types you know you you you've seen them on the edges of things they'll show up trying to hijack conservative events but they they pretty quickly show their show their true colors\nI Would never sell the presence of personal evil more strongly than into circumstances when I when I when people start talking\nAnd and they they start inventing their hatred of\nGod in his own people the Jews\nAnd outside of abortion clinics where they're killing babies those two places I feel that same sense of I Want holy water I Want to exercise is I Want to get away from there there's something called and profoundly malevolent and personally malevolent there that I don't feel anywhere else and I\nCan't explain it but that's that is why if you are\nPersonally close to the Jew Jesus you know as an attack on the Jews is an attack on God it's always been that way but very few Christians get that sometimes Christians are more gentile than they are actually followers of Jesus and so in in Nazi times\nMany Christians were confused and they thought well the Jews the Jews were Christians but the real Christians like deep for bomb for understood that to attack the people of God is to attack\nThe people of Jesus is to attack God himself this has been the project since since eating\nAnd I think we need to be really clear on this one thing that I never thought I Would be saying\nBut there is tremendous anti Semitism you noticed in Russia but also in Greece it's a fascinating thing that Greek nationalist think that their enemy\nIs the Jews there's a guy I right now who's leading a hyper a far right party in Greece I think the guys in prison but most of his people are also anti Semitic but they you know they say the bank or is it the global bankers blah blah blah blah blah but it's just fascinating to me ... ever you look you find this\nI think they used it to concoct the stories I mean even down to ... I was working at Safeway well that was in the book\nThe only details that were not hopelessly vegan verifiable and impossible to check the only like ... inches in reality that any either of those tests don't he's had came out of Marjah just book so I think whatever Democrats\nOr what whatever George Soros soup staffers were coming up with this stuff or using marches memoir and he was accused of everything I mean Michael I'm an Audi had him you know his his Julius so I think the when he brought to the table was said he was helping to run a ... a a\nGang rape ... organization all over the course of ... years and and and judge of course I couldn't really effectively defend himself because in his memoir he admitted to having memory lapses and you'll ... over and over again and people on on the\nDemocratic committee said we want mark judge here to testify we demand you subpoena mark judge ... nearly of course that he is he's written a book\nThat he doesn't have you know a reliable memory so they could have used his memory lapse as they could have weaponized the disease that he had a severe teenage alcoholism in order to destroy Brett Kavanaugh\nI said what they think is a pro life guy off the court\nOkay Mike ... I guess my question I got a couple of questions but the first one is\nIs it possible to get to the bottom of this of this in other words you're saying that they they they would can't we\nUltimately figure out who did this because if it is true that they orchestrated this that is the bombshell of the year because so many people myself included felt a bad for a\n... I Can't think of her her name the woman a\nPrint in four or ...\n... you know you hear her story it's heartbreaking if you think it was orchestrated not just a memory lapse and she's confused and she's got post traumatic stress from whatever she went through she's a fragile messed up person in many ways\nBut if you think that oh it's not just that this was orchestrated this was planned that is really really horrifying Sylvia Ernie\nYeah her attorney as he was dead were cats or the person who step forward and representative for free that woman for Fifteen Years has run a nonprofit funded almost entirely by George SARS is open society project okay so if you're curious who's who which which\nKind of organizations are bought were behind his head job well George Soros was one of ...\nMeanwhile meanwhile mark judge nobody paid his legal see if he's paying them now as she is an unemployed freelance writer he lost his apartment he lost most it all his freelancing jobs\nAnd he he he's on was on the verge of destitution I was able to help them set up a crowd funding thing and I hope your listeners will go visit it go to funding morality\nDot com and if you click on all projects you'll see that mark judge is one of their main project\nFunding morality dot com dot\nCom and their try ... then click on oil projects but I'm the heat we're trying to raise a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars for march so he can pay off his lawyers will get his apartment back in and get back on his feet because this is his name was dragged through the mud\nOr he was accused of being a gang rape organizer and Joel lugging teenage girls over the course of years with no proof whatsoever and and\nHe just complete ... and ... ... nobody I don't think enough people remembered also who ... who is the case here yes Brett Kavanaugh was a victim but now he is a lifetime appointment on the highest court and all that\nSo you know Clarence Thomas continue to pay a price for the false charges made against him but ultimately being on the court is quite a vindication OB\nMarches just you know a body left by the side of the road so I Hope people will go to funding morality dot com and click on all projects and and look at mark judge is a\nI outsource I Hope so as well John ah the people go to funding morality dot com all project I'm your article the lynching of mark judge is\nPJ Media is that the J media dot com yes yes PJ you are so prolific I Want to be clear PJ Media dot com\nAnd all other ...

specifically he declined a request to promote a a gay pride festival and he was sued for that and he had a local human rights commission that ruled against him\nAnd so now that cases all the way up before the Kentucky Supreme Court so far we've won that case but if they rule against him will have to ask the U.S Supreme Court to hear the case\nOkay folks do you hear that that is insane vantage

that's right two guys from queens that's right ah well look um let me let me just ask\nYou the reason I brought up where I was going with my commentary was that the folks who are backing this the George Soros backed organizers of this march\nThey're not stupid they understand that the optics hum of somebody setting the Rio Grande on fire doing anything literally or metaphorically incendiary a will look bad if you have\nAmerican troops are doing anything or to these people it's going to look bad\nIt's going to a boomerang and it's it's going to make us lose the midterms correcting the wrong\nI think that I think they've got it exactly backwards I think the reason Donald Trump won the nomination and recently won the election is the sense that country's spinning out of control and if you can't control your own borders thousands of foreigners marching\nWaving the flag of their own country to country there are allegedly being persecuted by 'cause that's when you were ready earlier effigy if you're governments persecuting you or you didn't see the Jews filling Germany waving Nazi flags and singing the songs and demanding\nThat the the us admit that no the wood tragically we turned away thousands of Jewish genuine refugees being persecuted by the Nazis Franklin Roosevelt did that these people are not refugees they're marching with the flags of their country\nMost of them are young military age men\nBasically is a lot more like the ... the landing in Mexico and trying to take the place over this is a ...\nOr care of and it's an invasion by people who are not refugees they even offer refuge in Mexico they've said no under no legal theory to these people have a right to enter the United states but if they set foot on American soil\nThen George Soros and the Roman Catholic Church lay on Catholic Church their lawyers will flock on them and it'll cost fifty thousand dollars each to prove that these people\nAre not refugees what we know perfectly well they're not refugees we need to keep them off us soil\nAnd Enron and President Trump needs to push Congress to fix our asylum and refugee laws are absurd there were a joke they're designed to help immigration lawyers make tens of thousands of dollars\nOff the tax payers while the fake refugees disappear into the country and work illegally and then have anchor babies who are citizens who can collect welfare\n... should we not changed the anchor babies law how did that ever happened\nWhen I was a misinterpretation of the fourteenth amendment was intend it was intended to get citizenship to the to the former slaves and their children lawyers and judges misinterpreted that to be that\nIf someone flying from Korea to Iceland and she's pregnant and she stops often Chicago She gives birth in the airport that kids are citizens\nThat have right now I Will tell that\n... wouldn't that be a simple fix it's fairly clear and fairly ridiculous to most Americans that that that that that should be changed don't you think\nThe president would would they wouldn't they wouldn't need to pass a law and and see\nHe made a get it through Congress and the end the last two a challenge it in ... and it would go to the Supreme Court and I suspect that we we now have a court which would uphold a scene interpretation of that that just because an illegal immigrant while you're holding her for deportation gives birth all of a sudden she\nAnd stay and and our kitchen get welfare and you know the family can't be separated the sanctity of the family I mean I think if Donald Trump's\nHe needs to stand for the one way to lose the times is to give in to this it's a look utterly week is to tell the Republicans look we can't do anything even Donald Trump as president can't stop a massive invasion from Latin America that sends a green light to the next four and five and six and seven invasion\nOr I Can't we punish Mexico they're the ones that are allowing this\nI think we frankly should put our troops into it I mean and the war is occupying the the border on the Mexican side so these people can enter the country\nI mean wouldn't that hey that'd be awesome maybe we could reach ... and we we take Mexico\nWell I don't want to I don't know I Want to inches on their side of the border and that's how much of Mexico I was but it but but\nBut you know I mean I joke but it is interesting to me that why why aren't the Mexicans taking care of this like why are they allowing this to have tried\nTo stop these people in the attack their police they're bloody federal ... Mexican police attacked by these guys I mean this is an it's an army\nSo they have an army so the Mexicans cannot stop this they're they're ... and they would actually violent\nForce and then they

and another way\nAnd I guess my question to you would be what you think it's possible to do right now in to the United states to take a role in this it seems that Brecht said a was a very healthy sign

other\nEuropean countries are going to say we are not going to be forced into a conflict with Russia suicidal we're not going to do it and so then you get turmoil and things get churned up\nAs I said earlier it's already happening in ... in Italy you know just like in Greece Greece but came up with the Newport forget his name I forget the name of the leader but now they're saying things happen and there's like three parties\nAnd together they have more votes but still not the kind of support that they need to be\nWe're a bonus\nTo you but it's happening already and show which is French French

R. at AOL dot com [noise]\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis prayer for a different Larry Elder last friday\nIn this hour you can continue to talk about some of the things we've been talking about the last few hours but I said I wanted to talk about illegal immigration especially with the caravan approaching\nI've talked about illegal immigration for over Twenty years now and I've never wavered in my position the issue is really not that difficult if you acknowledge the simple fact\nThat people across the border illegally have come here legally as one caller pointed out which one of those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens so you have the term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents has the same as place them somewhere or lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over\nIf there are legal then they're not allowed to be here and of story\nIf you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walked into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is their account if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents approving the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase on document as if they are entitled to your house and bank account if only they could find a misplaced documents\nFor years now that that the left as one of the argument over language whether it's undocumented versus illegal livable wage versus minimum wage global warming or climate change or whatever it is the moment\nBut the left is much better to finding the terms and using the language to their benefit of course that helps to have a media on your side perpetuating these false it's so so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they're explaining the office\nAnd the most recent case being parents with children\nTrying to get asylum if that's really the case if they're not coming in for the benefits of work and President Trump and Republicans accuse you heard President Obama and lost our we have the clip them of ripping children from the mother's arms and putting these children in cold cages [noise]\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration [noise]\nHe has more I mean I Would be if I were going to anybody I Know President Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place they would be no issue no one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes but the less than the Democrats and the media often the same thing I Do not believe in sovereignty but rather they believed in open borders but they don't like to admit it because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms never mind that when anyone does something illegal and they are hold off to jail you know their children do not go with them to jail they're also then so to speak torn away from them\nAnd the ... in the latest reincarnation of this conflict hundreds of Hondurans another legals are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nThat was no doubt my my name is Thirteen and other people who would do us harm or among them so again President Trump to Republicans will be on the defense of just because they want to defend our borders and the media no doubt about it will again show you crying children and distraught mothers\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right as I said to decide who gets into our country or a house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right to protect the American people from arm where the from terrorism or as one caller mentioned last hour disease or even for that matter to make sure that people come here is a radical concept share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south Mexico\nSome of us think this is so obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense I mention it last hour the Democrats won more votes and the country club Republicans want cheap labor of course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party I Know\nSo you have people like George W. Bush remember this and Karl Rove saying things like Bush got up to forty percent of Hispanics vote when he ran in Texas\nWonderful I'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nA loss in politics a sixteen a forty percent is huge and that's based on optimistic assumption most of the ... illegal immigrants coming for jobs as we've long established but they also take advantage of government handouts that the rest of us are paying for\nAnd the Republican Party can never out to the Democrats in offering better give it up\nSo here's the phrase I've used over the years if ever given a choice between Democrats and Democrats they always choose the real thing\nWho are these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked Republicans will never win a national election again so even even on a purely selfish basis for those in the conservative side it was clear that we need to control the border but how about fairness for everybody [noise]\nWhat do you say to people around the world who've been waiting many years to get here but I have to undergo long waits and in in ... bottom national paperwork even have a chance of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those are dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools one color on a different radio network when I was on a week or so ago suggested that border walls don't work in the long run\nBut even if that were true I told him I bet they worked in the short run to stop mass of people coming here don't you wish we had a border now as we will are going to be confronted with these people in short time not to mention these really live safe for murder by their fans\nWe need we need to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming into our country and I don't mean with a comprehensive immigration plan that has been signed onto ... public as like Bush George W. Bush or Paul Ryan no amnesty and no pathway to citizenship should be accepted that rewards illegal behavior\nBut there to those who say the border wall won't work\nThey use the same or ... I mentioned this that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent Americans use and I had at the end of last summer when they say the un documents commit oh he said the caller challenge me have they committed mass murder no it's not like the argument or have they commit fewer crimes percentage wise the Native Americans\nWho cares even if that is true\nIf an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry in the first place no matter what the percentage and that well preventing one Hamas murderers in Israel for men drinks would have said that Israelis life\nThe logic of these arguments is baffling unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms for example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities where criminal illegals are given safe harbor\nYou come up with a phony arguments like illegals will not cooperate with the authorities you've heard this if they know they can be apprehended are sent home\nOh about not allowing them to come in the first place and then we wouldn't care if they cooperated with authorities how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate to the evil police officers in ice who have the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes some of the rest of us have to live with long waits at hospitals deteriorating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities\nSo what's my solution I said I Would give it to you take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you force strict penalties against businesses which one of you mentioned that hire illegals even sending some see CEOs to jail\nAnd you would be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney had it right but he used the wrong language there we go again when he said self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remain I'd be willing to have a conversation with because they would stay for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake please enough of the government sending out the wrong message with bilingual education classes or bilingual government documents\nOur country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our values\nAs I said our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed at Ellis Island as ... said one of the colors last hour\nThey didn't come here for free benefits they didn't come here for free hospital care free schools\nThey didn't come here for any of that it was so happy to be in the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end illegal immigration and take our country back tell me what you think you'd wanna Prager seven seven six I'm Mark ... filling in for Dennis\nTo work uh have been violating these laws but nobody ever mentions it or not otherwise law abiding it's simply a myth\nOr my daughter was actually a victim of a I D theft by illegal alien using her Social Security number was ... when she was a child mhm so uh I don't know why the conservatives Republicans\nDon't push back on this whole illegal thing a by by describing what's happening here is entirely when people come here to work [noise]\nYeah just a one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me\nThere's got to be an orderly procedure that house someone gets into a country we call that legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to the people you want to give the opportunity to\nSeem so obvious to me that's why you have to have when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been a terrific a boost to the United states of America yeah legal immigrants but you changed the language let's go to Rick in the Bronx Rick you're on was mark\nThanks for taking my call more I guess for one thing that changed the big lost all I mean if you like this caravan of course they want they want they either\nPathway contented ... and the out a yellow El Salvador Guatemala decent people what's lost in those countries that pose conference thought to be just gang dogs and less search team or what you want to do\nYou all know the real point is I thought you were getting too they aren't all good people that they are they're going to be terrorists among them they're going to be people that don't value the ideals that we do in the United states of America forgive me even people with disease right they haven't been ... that's the one caller pointed out so you have\nTo have some means of doing some orderly process that's the whole point his argument seems such such an easy one to win if you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let a million people in a year\nThere's a way to do here the rules here the procedures you have to follow them\n... President Trump or Republicans are going to lose this when either way right you'd call out the national guard or whatever you do you stop them from coming in what you got to do your evil bad guys as Obama said ripping children away from their mothers and everybody joins in with that trait\nAnd if you uh don't stop them you have an invasion of people coming in these people aren't coming in for something that maybe uh some of them but a lot of them we know that kind of I don't blame them by the way the coming in for jobs that come into the benefits were the ones to blame let me know what you think ...\nSeven seven six Marcus to filling in for Dennis ...\nWithin a Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studio [noise]\nUsed to our news drug nine Ninety dot com I'm wearing\nThose are bad for vice president Mike Pence has campaigned for Republican candidates and Michigan had to next week's election just weeks ahead of the mid term election\nThey hope will deliver them a majority of Democrats are promising to prioritize a pro homosexual bill in order to middle Nancy Pelosi's bound introduce the equality act which would add a so called sexual orientation and gender identity of the Nineteen sixty four civil rights act\nAnd expand those protections beyond the workplace but North Dakota bad has been sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to kidnap a baby that his then girlfriend had cut from their neighbors body\nAnd mind police about William Hain pleaded guilty to charges last month and was sentenced Monday\nSearch and rescue personnel work through the night to find victims of the line airplane crash in Indonesia sending twenty four body bags to identification experts as the airlines flew dozens of breathing relatives the country's capital more details of this for a news dot com oh\nThis is talk of Ninety whether clearing a chilly tonight but not as easy as today ... tomorrow mostly sunny my fifty seven to ... forty one Wednesday mostly sunny and ...
