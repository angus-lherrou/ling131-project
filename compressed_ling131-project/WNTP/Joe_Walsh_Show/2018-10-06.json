survive long term and and for me Eric I Believe that what this comes down to is\nWhether or not people who lose an election will accept the results\nWhat we're seeing is the outgrowth of people who never accepted the results of the twenty sixteen presidential election and they have spent the last almost two years trying to de legitimize the election and the person who won\nAnd every decision mix whether it was a decision involving protecting our borders\nWhere there was a decision in ... ah the negotiations with North Korea\nGetting out of the deal with Iran every single thing this president does\nIts attacked whether legally or politically by those who were fused to accept that he is the president of the United states and that is a dangerous thing I didn't like it when President Obama was elected didn't vote for him either time um [noise] but I never ever\nThought that the way to deal with his presidency\nWas to try to pretend that he didn't win the election and took coach and he said elections have consequences while it appears that to uh to people on the left the consequences of that election they don't like is to throw a tantrum\nAct Petra slowly like a five year old a hold your breath to your face turns blue and scream and throw things across the room and break every window in the house\nIsn't that isn't that what George Washington did\nA it really is kind of funny actually because when you say that\nIt it it makes a I I think most people realize that something has happened in the country it's it's funny because I remember even the election of two thousand and we have the hanging chads and that bizarre period no one had ever lived through anything like it where where\nYou know the day after election you don't know who won in the week after you don't know who won and I remember at the time thinking this is undermining our institutions because what it does is it it breeds a kind of cynicism and people are\nThere are no clear answers that we've kind of depend on you know a Supreme Court judges to make these decisions and somehow\nOr he did something that I think we've been living with ever since that some of our institutions the things we take for granted\nA all seem to be called into question and when you have people are not a seeming to be able to accept the results of an election like this it it just reminds me of that it's sort of it's bad for everybody I guess is the point where destroying ourselves with this kind of thinking\n[noise]\nWe we truly are but what we're doing is is really teaching the wrong lesson to a up and coming young Americans are everybody doesn't get a trophy everyone doesn't win\nSometimes you win sometimes you lose and the class and dignity with which you lose probably has a greater reflection of real character than how you handle your victories that's right and what we're seeing is a complete breakdown in the class and character of people who did not get their way\nAnd who never grew out of this notion that I'm supposed to get a trophy oh wait you mean it didn't turn out like I wanted well then if I Can't when nobody can win and I'll just break the game up into a thousand pieces ... that's what I'm saying or\nThe country can't survive that we can survive rate swings at the end the one between the right in the ... we had before and we and again Democrats will be elected in the future but\nI Would say this to my Republican brothers and sisters if when they are we take to the streets and we were funny hats and we refused to say that this person is our president\nAnd you know we

no\nA free chance of objectivity but she's a tough kid and she's very good at what she does and I was in Chicago last night I was talking to some people who were telling me how much they love my daughter had great she was and and they said you know where does she get that I said well a couple of things first ... two older brothers that were really mean to her\nAnd she had early on to the side that if she was going to survive she's going to have to fight back in stand your ground and she learned it or did she learned it I mean after her brothers did things like super glue her fingers together of required a trip to the emergency\nYou sound like a couple of Irish sons of guns are really I Love the two of you because you you do you live your passion to use one of the cliches of our day\nBut you you use your skills as journalists to tell these important story so for somebody who doesn't know anything\nAbout the story of ... will now obviously the movie is just coming out now it's an important movie I Hope people will go see it desperately\nI Hope that and it's why I wanted to have you want for this hour but but tell us and in Salem I'm One of the basic give us a thumbnail sketch in case somebody just tuning in they say I've never heard of this [noise]\nCriminals who is going to have to kind of like what I was on the little ... go ahead go ahead there or\nIs this the parents are often the ordinary we're not so much in the picture of a marriage it's like no you go darling no you go you go ahead and Kermit God who is an awesome\nDoctor who um is serving tree light sentences and the principal in Pennsylvania\nFor delivering babies alive and then and then cutting or next week or so he did that for Thirty years we've been purity because his tablets humans who who who you know who wants to protect abortion but nothing about all the warning signs even though and in fact two women died and it's been like and they still did not bring\n'em so these are the ... this is the movie is actually about the trial\nInvestigation and the trial if we show nothing gory it's not at all like that it's a lot like a law and order episode but but I think they just went to a credit card bill did um and a jury you know all pro pro abortion people actually over you know not pro life people convicted of murder for doing that and\nTo assume brings up a lot of questions about how did he get away with it for so long\nUm why would a governor governor Tom Ridge a Republican governor Catholics have allowed this to happen during his sharing his time as governor and in fact why was it that that same governor said hands off the abortion clinics which was part of the reasons like off the last ... Watson discovered earlier\nUm you know there's no question that the story brings up and not the least of which is how did the media ignored that this happened once the story could break and was in the court in Philadelphia how it is that most people in the country have never heard of ... name\nWhere we're living in very divided times and this is this is hard numbers if you want to know how divided they are\nA ... even when someone does a things as horrific as gruesome as this man did if somehow falls under the rubric of of abortion nobody wants to know the facts and in this case\nUh because we do have laws in this country we were forced to deal with the fact and this man as you said it's not behind bars\nServing three life sentences I mean this is an amazing thing so what precisely was this butcher convicted of that he is now behind bars for three lifetimes if that were possible [noise] well and\nHe's he knows he's convicted of murder and murdering bit but he's also killing his patient and you know he he won a an abortion clinic that was a grand jury in Philadelphia and I'm sure a graduate Philadelphia I've seen a lot they called the ... of horrors\nI'm about to get a lot to do this that the bodies were being ... to ... say the bodies were piling up but they actually were literally piling up in a in his in his basement or ... and we ended up coming out of a clinic\nBoth the authorities didn't want to do anything and I we're ... we made a movie about it\nI Want to tell people look it's not it's not a gory it's got a horror movie it's a courtroom drama and it's about the trial it's about\nHow ... how you go from being this non being protected species or two detectives good detectives and good lawyers realizing this is not like there's something wrong here on fighting against the political backlash to the media backlash to bring justice to the machine or a boy so is\nIf people want to know about the movie or just so a cause people to an Internet radio programs they can do to God's Nell movie dot com God's ... G O s N E L L God's Nell movie dot com\nUm ... what what made you think the two of you that the movie needed to be made about this\nA tremendous book about it I Know the book did very well and people are interested in the book uh I Would recommend highly or that they get a copy of the book for all the details movies can never give those kinds of details but uh what what persuaded you need to make a movie [noise]\nYou know things are treated like a like a movie in in in reaching a very wide audience um\nYou know not everyone read read books that are all the time but they don't they just don't like reading\nUm even documentaries are something that a lot of people you know don't really like to watch and we actually thought you know what you know what's really popular you know the crime John ... is a very very popular in the United states but a lot of TV show with our climate here for years with incredible crime story\nBut ... ... am to ... you know it's true crime and at the central it is a very impressive investigation ... you know I said\nYou know it's amazing that cop gym or the ... trench with the story and then you know followed up very closely by the assistant district attorneys to women relate to investigate this story and put this guy behind bars um you know it is that the you know that's that's very much that I very much the attraction\nAnd and failing did you direct this movie\nYou know what we produced as a mix seriously the veteran actor next year seat\nA directed at you know you probably know Mick from ah I'm justified the TV series but also Nick Nick was an actor and the shape of water he was also in three billboards outside ebbing Missouri just just a names and you know they basically every movie you know a big movie the last\nWhen he goes to the post office and he said that's what he wants to do while he was he felt like this was something that he was he took to him really it's designed for him so\nHe's still a good job um you know thank God I didn't direct it uh you know as a journalist I Would have been too concerned with you know making sure that our the thing is you know its toll exotic well you know but Nick Nick ...\nGauge ... story truth but he's probably all on the street and we'll direction towards an untold story and that's very important we want this to be accessible to people I mean as you say a book was a best seller but you know that it's still a limited audience that Iraq\nWas a true crime drama in America for a you know everyone watches out you know if you watch [noise] if you watch you know law and order you'll love this\nWell I was going to say that uh you know to tell a story like this\nIt is a gruesome story but you don't need to show the horror you can apply it and there have been many films a that have dealt with abortion in Morrow bleak way this is of course before roe v Wade thing became hot button and movies don't touch it anymore\nBut there was a time when you could do that the movie ... feet with ah Michael Cain and Shelly winters brilliant movie from Nineteen sixty six\nUh it deals with an abortion and it is just one of those things I Will never forget it they don't show anything but it

just didn't think Ehrlich fabulous some people will remember are building the with the Affleck guy for many years\nI'm not a great character actor and do the job well\nI mean I Can't think of it more difficult role to play them this monster now you you know you talk about a gods now of being you you you say and this is often the case with with people who have allowed\nGenuine satanic evil or into their lives that they there's often they can be very charming it's very creepy really uh the that somebody who is done horrors unimaginable murdering babies a\nBite snooping there next with scissors one of the most gruesome things imaginable but he seems to be very jolly and cheerful and I want a strange thing\n\nAnd like you know I mean you know he's ... he's got that kind of electric ... you know type of personality he you know he smiles he has this very intellectual exploits very soft voice and you know very charming 'em and you know\nWhat's Thirty years I mean basically Thirty years he was he he you know whether he's operating within ... well you know Seventeen of those years several\nTeen of those years no one expected the clinic no one of the department of health decided to to to see you know to do that\nAnd that's interesting just what you were saying there Eric you know but people need to know what's going on in the country we one of the parts of the film that we you know where most crowd opened up they think it's really important that we and we certainly ... were very\nVery clear we wanted to have it in the screenplay was you know that during the actual trial of credit card bill you know to abortion doctors were brought in because they needed to explain\nTo the jury what a good portion good legal abortion laws so that they could distinguish between bass and murder 'em and I can tell you I I I've friends of mine who are medical who are in the medical profession that doctors who who come into that particular effects that the movie\nOf educational to them as alert they learn something they didn't know before one dear friend of mine is the next it's a very highly qualified to work all over the United states of America did not know so this is why exactly what you're saying you know people need to go because they're going to get an education\nThink the other side it's just like law and order episode you have this you know a portion doctor on the stand as can you describe\nA legal abortion to the to the jury and I remember failed a night at the very very beginning of this process that whatever how that testimony will be in the movie in the movie script was very important to us because we believe no one has ever done that before the movie I think it's a complete first\nAnd ... and and no one can criticize it because it's it's basically stole it from the actual transcript of the trial\nYou know it wasn't you know what would you know rising there you know um and it was so important um to include that because\n... you know we don't have ... where where else are you going to get that information it's such an unbiased and all you know on varnish way and I think it's ... it's quite shocking for people who hear it even people who think they know that subject there'll be quite shocked to hear that's\nThing we probably haven't said because we know the subject so well and certainly both of you do but but what God's nails did that makes them a serial killer or it's not just of course that he's doing very late term abortions which are gruesome but\nUnfortunately quite legal in America but he was also because he made a lot of money off of a killing children who were viable obviously and you describe\nBut described that early on but but but these children would often be born alive and he would he would murdered them a ... and that is really why he is behind bars is it not\nYeah yeah I mean isn't he emerged of babies born alive he he murdered his own patients by the way\nA by allowing on registered on qualified stop to get the ...\nAnd he also operated October ... um you know he ... he also did it in in the the the legal\nLimit for abortion and in Pennsylvania is any credible twenty four weeks and incredible twenty four weeks like you know six months she was six months pregnant and having the ocean I've ever I wasn't good enough for him heated even earlier than that by during the week and then\nOn the week on a Sunday\nIt get abortions sold it to be didn't trust any of the other members of style to a system to him and his wife did what he called the special kids as if he was doing twenty four plus during the week what would you do in the weekend you know nine months and months nine months that's\nThat's what he was on any nobody would prosecute him he was ... quite confident that he could get away with this obviously with the with the with the liberal abortion climate in America and especially in Pennsylvania\nAnd he was white with rights because we know and we knew he was right because we know despite multiple complaints I Love to lots of complaints and in fact they all you know be complaints came to light during the grand jury investigation you know I get\nAll of the matter how bad things got and obviously I mean it doesn't get much worse to women dying noticing what inspired the department of health and Pennsylvania to inspect ... and you know that's a new reason why people need to go and see the movie if this can happen in Pennsylvania ... century not in some ...\nSome other ... century now back in the dark ages because now it's getting happening now in\nPennsylvania I it can happen to live in wherever you're listening can ... holiday Pennsylvania\nYou don't get more correct that the Pennsylvania you know get more progressive than the city of brotherly love the city\nWhere

an hour or a few issues [noise]\nIs ultimately deeper but on the other hand you get topics that you would never would otherwise have if you just have people Colin [noise] so that's the story and let's go to your calls immediately Matty in Houston, Texas Hi Maddie Dennis Prager\nHuh OK yeah Hi who they are my my ... oh\nWell congratulations that is very exciting I'm very I'm happy that you're excited\nOr so I'll go go\nDo I have advice for you mad as precious I could spend the next hour giving you advice [laughter]\n[noise] uh yes I Do so ah yeah here goes I'm just putting you on hold there [noise] so what the\nWhat does it mean to be a bar or ... ... is the Hebrew word for commandment it's translated often is good deed and many commandments are good deeds but it means commandment [noise] so let's take that seriously the notion in Judaism is that a\nGirl a twelve or a boy at Thirteen is now responsible for their own sins\nUntil now you did bad it was on your parents' record now it's on your record\nWhile one should be excited at their bar mitzvah one should be a little afraid to because now there is no protective shield between you and your moral record before God\nYou can't blame your parents as of tomorrow in fact parents say a prayer thanking God that they are now freed from [laughter] from the moral record of their children I take\nThat very seriously seriously when I was your age I took it seriously as the as the parent of two book two boys who had permits for this\nSo this is a spectacular notion I Am now responsible for my life it's the matter is the opposite of what is taught in America today to so many kids I'm not responsible for my life others are\nSo that's that's a big one that you now take control of your moral life\nAnd does that make sense yeah\nOh for okay thank you that's that's precious I'll give you another one the the on the word commandment do right\nI've said this often the biggest difference between my religious and I think Christians religious education and secular education in America today is this\nI was raised the I'll give you two differences I was raised obligation oriented kids today are raised rights oriented\nAre you going to make a better human being whose preoccupied with his or her rights or his or her obligations\nI didn't hear the word rights 'til I got to college\nI ... I knew the word obligations throughout throughout my life oh by the way to give you a real power for example the uh uh Judaism and Christianity believe that that husband and wife have sexual obligations to the to their spouse\nYou say that today you're accused of advocating marital rape Huffington Post just accused me of marital rape second time I've been accused at least I Know of I'm sure it doesn't know that this doesn't times but I mean the big places because I wrote an article ten years ago\nAnd will try and proud of and people should read it\nSaying that given the ... the importance of sex to a marriage if you love your husband\nAnd he loves you and he's a good man don't let mood alone determine whether you will have sex with him sometimes just have it because you love him that's called marital rape today\nThat I Believe that there are obligations I have obligations to my wife ... in in a whole host the berries and she has obligations to me in a whole host the various\nThe other difference between a religious education of a secular education I was told that the greatest problem in Dennis ... life is Dennis predator cuts a religious school Christian school Jewish school\nThe biggest issue when your life is you know\nSecular school biggest issue in life is American society sexism racism is either phobia homophobia et cetera big difference say so those are my areas for Matty\nGood luck wouldn't it be fun if I showed up just flew to Houston and showed up [noise] I just you have no idea that there was a part of me that would love to do that [laughter]\nI don't know if the rabbi would be happy [laughter]\nA good though the let's see uh Andrew in Fort Worth high\n... very well thank you\nFor the question for you would you rather be your only respected and why\nIt depends by whom\nGotcha I don't mean\nBy fear that when I go and like I fear consequences for um ... my parents or my spouse\nI rather that America be feared than anything else so if it if there were times where respected I think that the I think if my children had no fear of me it wouldn't have been good\nDoes that but today at their ages in their twenties and thirties I don't I don't want them to fear me I don't I don't think that's that would be a good thing I Want them to respect me I Love me\nBut uh when they're when they're eight I Would like them to fear me you'll like this Andrew I asked I did an hour once if you didn't do drugs when you were in high school or college or oh say high school why not\nThe biggest the most common answer was because my mother would kill me\n\nThat's good rate and read or write Yes sir thank you very much appreciate your call\nGot a lot of young cold is on the on the on the ... hour it and um the male female and I'm a happy\nIs very interesting though I have a theory on that book oldie but for them but I remember I said I Would like America feared yeah I Do when\nAmerica's fear there's more peace on earth if you like a piece you want America feared if you are like war then you don't want America feared you just want America like any other nation that's why I said if\nThe Nobel Peace prize we're really awarded to those who deserve\nIt the American armed forces would get the Nobel Peace prize the greatest force for peace on earth is American might\nOK okay\nMan why do I have a feeling that the current president would agree with that and the previous president with not just a hunch okey dokey\nAnd we'll go to Cameron in Phoenix hello camera and\nAll that that's how you doing\nReal real well thank
